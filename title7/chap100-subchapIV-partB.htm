<p class="statutory-body-1em">Further losses in area quota pools, other than losses incurred as a result of transfers from additional loan pools to quota loan pools under section 1358&ndash;1(b)(8) of this title, shall be offset by any gains or profits from quota pools in other production areas (other than separate type pools established under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico) in such manner as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Offset generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If losses in an area quota pool have not been entirely offset under the preceding paragraphs, further losses shall be offset by any gains or profits from additional peanuts (other than separate type pools established under subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section for Valencia peanuts produced in New Mexico) owned or controlled by the Commodity Credit Corporation and sold for domestic edible use, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary. This paragraph shall not apply to profits or gains from a farm with 1 acre or less of peanut production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Second use of marketing assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall use funds collected under subsection (g) of this section and attributable to handlers to offset further losses in area quota pools.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Increased assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If use of the authorities provided in the preceding paragraphs is not sufficient to cover losses in an area quota pool, the Secretary shall increase the marketing assessment for producers established under subsection (g) of this section by such an amount as the Secretary considers necessary to cover the losses. The increased assessment shall apply only to quota peanuts in the production area covered by the pool. Amounts collected under subsection (g) of this section as a result of the increased assessment shall be retained by the Secretary to cover losses in that pool.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Disapproval of quotas</h4>
