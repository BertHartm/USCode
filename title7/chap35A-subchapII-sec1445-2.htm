<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) continue to make price support available to producers through such association in accordance with loan agreements entered into between the Corporation and such association; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish and maintain in accordance with this section a No Net Cost Tobacco Account for such association in lieu of the No Net Cost Tobacco Fund established within such association under section 1445&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of No Net Cost Tobacco Account within Commodity Credit Corporation; disposition of amounts in No Net Cost Tobacco Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any Account established for an association under subsection (b)(2) of this section shall be established within the Corporation and shall be comprised of amounts paid by producers, purchasers, and importers under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the establishment of an Account for an association, any amount in the No Net Cost Tobacco Fund established within such association under section 1445&ndash;1 of this title shall be applied or disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may approve or prescribe, except that such amount shall, to the extent necessary, first be applied or used for the purposes therefor prescribed in such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of assessments to Corporation for deposit into Account; determination and adjustment of amounts; collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) If an Account is established for an association under subsection (b)(2) of this section, then the Secretary shall require (in lieu of any requirement under section 1445&ndash;1(d)(1) of this title) that each producer of the kind of tobacco involved whose farm is within such association's area shall, as a condition of eligibility for price support, agree, with respect to all of such kind of tobacco marketed by the producer from the farm, to pay to the Corporation, for deposit in such association's Account, marketing assessments as determined under paragraph (2) and collected under paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall also require (in lieu of any requirement under section 1445&ndash;1(d)(1) of this title) that each purchaser of Flue-cured and Burley quota tobacco shall pay to the Corporation, for deposit in the Account of such association, an assessment, as determined under paragraph (2) and collected under paragraph (3), with respect to purchases of all such kind of tobacco marketed by a producer from a farm (including purchases of such tobacco from the 1986 and subsequent crops from the association).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall also require (in lieu of any requirement under section 1445&ndash;1(d)(1) of this title) that each importer of Flue-cured and Burley tobacco shall pay to the Corporation, for deposit in the Account of the association, an assessment, as determined under paragraph (2) and collected under paragraph (3), with respect to purchases of all such kinds of tobacco imported by the importer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine and adjust from time to time, in consultation with such association, the amount of the marketing assessment which shall be imposed, as a condition of eligibility for price support, on each pound of the kind of tobacco involved marketed by a producer from a farm within such association's area and the amount of the assessment to be paid by purchasers of tobacco. The amount of the assessment to be paid by producers and purchasers shall be determined in such a manner that producers and purchasers share equally, to the maximum extent practicable, in maintaining the Account of an association. In making such determination with respect to the assessment of a purchaser, only 1985 and subsequent crops of Flue-cured and Burley quota tobacco shall be taken into account. The amount of the assessment shall be equal to an amount which, when collected, will result in an accumulation of an Account for such association adequate to reimburse the Corporation for any net losses which the Corporation may sustain under its loan agreements with such association, based on reasonable estimates of the amounts which the Corporation will lend to such association under such agreements and the proceeds which will be realized from the sales of the kind of tobacco involved which are pledged to the Corporation by such association as security for loans. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this paragraph, the amount of any assessment that is determined by the Secretary for the 1986 and subsequent crops of Burley quota tobacco shall be <!-- PDFPage:694 -->determined without regard to any net losses that the Corporation may sustain under the loan agreements of the Corporation with such association with respect to the 1983 crop of such tobacco.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The amount of the assessment to be paid by importers shall be an amount that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the number of pounds of tobacco that is imported by the importer; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the sum of the amount of per pound producer and purchaser assessments that are payable by domestic producers and purchasers of the respective kind of tobacco under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), any assessment to be paid by a producer or a purchaser under paragraph (1) shall be collected from the person who acquired the tobacco involved from such producer, except that if the tobacco is marketed by sale, an amount equal to the producer assessment may be deducted by the purchaser from the price paid to such producer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If tobacco of the kind for which an Account is established is marketed by a producer through a warehouseman or agent, both the producer and the purchaser assessment shall be collected from such warehouseman or agent, who may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) deduct an amount equal to the producer assessment from the price paid to the producer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) add an amount equal to the purchaser assessment to the price paid by the purchaser.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If tobacco of the kind for which an Account is established is marketed by a producer directly to any person outside the United States, both the producer and the purchaser assessment shall be collected from the producer, who may add an amount equal to the purchaser assessment to the price paid by the purchaser.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If Flue-cured or Burley tobacco is imported by an importer, any importer assessment required by subsection (d) of this section shall be collected from the importer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposits into Account; insurance against net losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts deposited in an Account established for an association shall be used by the Secretary for the purpose of ensuring, insofar as practicable, that the Corporation under its loan agreements with such association will suffer, with respect to the crop involved, no net losses (including, but not limited to, recovery of the amount of loans extended to cover the overhead costs of the association), after any net gains are applied to net losses of the Corporation pursuant to subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Suspension of payment and collection of marketing assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide, in any loan agreement between the Corporation and an association for which an Account has been established under subsection (b)(2) of this section, that if the Secretary determines that the amount in such Account or the net gains referred to in subsection (h) of this section exceed the amounts necessary for the purposes of this section, then the Secretary, in consultation with such association, may suspend the payment and collection of marketing assessments under this section upon terms and conditions established by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disposition of amounts in Account in the event of termination of loan agreement or account or dissolution or merger of association</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any association for which an Account is established under subsection (b)(2) of this section, if a loan agreement between the Corporation and such association is terminated, if such association is dissolved or merges with another association that has entered into a loan agreement with the Corporation to make price support available to producers of the kind of tobacco involved, or if such Account terminates by operation of law, then amounts in such Account and the net gains referred to in subsection (h) of this section shall be applied to or disposed of in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe, except that they shall, to the extent necessary, first be applied to or used for the purposes therefor prescribed in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Net gains</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of section 1445&ndash;1(d)(5) of this title relating to net gains shall apply to any loan agreement between an association and the Corporation entered into upon or after the establishment of an Account for such association under subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall issue regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Failure to collect assessment; marketing penalty; civil action for review of penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Each person who fails to collect any assessment as required by subsection (d)(3) of this section and remit such assessment to the Corporation, at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, shall be liable, in addition to any amount due, to a marketing penalty at a rate equal to 75 percent of the average market price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for the kind of tobacco involved for the immediately preceding year on the quantity of tobacco as to which the failure occurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each importer who fails to pay to the Corporation an assessment as required by subsection (d) of this section at such time and in such manner as may be prescribed by the Secretary, shall be liable, in addition to any amount due, to a marketing penalty at a rate equal to 75 percent of the average market price (calculated to the nearest whole cent) for the respective kind of tobacco for the immediately preceding year on the quantity of tobacco as to which the failure occurs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may reduce any such marketing penalty in such amount as the Secretary determines equitable in any case in which the Secretary determines that the failure was unintentional or without knowledge on the part of the person concerned.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:695 --><p class="statutory-body">(D) Any penalty provided for under this paragraph shall be assessed by the Secretary after notice and opportunity for a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this subsection may obtain review of such penalty in an appropriate district court of the United States by filing a civil action in such court not later than 30 days after such penalty is imposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record on which the penalty is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction to review and enforce any penalty imposed under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An amount equivalent to any penalty collected by the Secretary under this subsection shall be transmitted by the Secretary to the Corporation, for deposit in the Account of the appropriate association.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The remedies provided in this subsection shall be in addition to, and not exclusive of, other remedies that may be available.</p>
