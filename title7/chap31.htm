Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, such loans shall be made under the same terms and conditions as are provided in section 904 of this title, for the purpose of financing the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary, in making such loans, shall give preference to persons providing telephone service in rural areas, to public bodies now providing telephone service in rural areas, and to cooperative, nonprofit, limited dividend, or mutual associations: <em>And provided further</em>, That for a period of one year from and after October 28, 1949, applications for loans received by the Secretary from persons who on October 28, 1949, are engaged in the operation of existing telephone service in rural areas shall be considered and acted upon before action is taken upon any application received from any other person for any loan to finance the furnishing or improvement of telephone service to substantially the same subscribers.

In a State in which there is no such agency or regulatory body legally authorized to issue such certificates to the applicant, no loan shall be made under this section unless the Secretary shall determine (and set forth his reasons therefor in writing) that no duplication of lines, facilities, or systems, providing reasonably adequate services will result therefrom.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to make and issue interim notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations of the fund and for making loans, advances and authorized expenditures out of the fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this section. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such interim notes to the Secretary of the Treasury shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase for resale obligations insured through the fund when offered by the Secretary. Such resales shall be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine. Purchases and resales by the Secretary of the Treasury hereunder shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and not lending (budget outlays) of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may, on an insured basis or otherwise, sell and assign any notes in the fund or sell certificates of beneficial ownership therein to the Secretary of the Treasury or in the private market. Any sale by the Secretary of notes individually or in blocks shall be treated as a sale of assets for the purposes of chapter 11 of title 31, notwithstanding the fact that the Secretary, under an agreement with the purchaser or purchasers, holds the debt instruments evidencing the loans and holds or reinvests payments thereon as trustee and custodian for the purchaser or purchasers of the individual note or of the certificate of beneficial ownership in a number of such notes. Security instruments taken by the Secretary in connection with any notes in the fund may constitute liens running to the United States notwithstanding the fact that such notes may be thereafter held by purchasers thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a borrower of a loan made by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed under section 936 of this title may prepay such loan (or any loan advance thereunder) by paying the outstanding principal balance due on the loan (or advance), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the loan is outstanding on July 2, 1986;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private capital, with the existing loan guarantee, is used to replace the loan; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disqualification for prepayment on finding of adverse affect on Federal Financing Bank</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A borrower will not qualify for prepayment under this section if, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prepay in such borrower's case would adversely affect the operation of the Federal Financing Bank.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall be effective in fiscal year 1987 only for any loan the prepayment of the principal amount of which will cause the cumulative amount of net proceeds from all such <!-- PDFPage:456 -->prepayments made during such year to exceed $2,017,500,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of permissible prepayments; establishment of eligibility criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall permit, subject to subsection (a) of this section, prepayments of principal on loans in fiscal year 1987 under this section or Public Law 99&ndash;349 in such amounts as to realize net proceeds from all such prepayments in fiscal year 1987 in an amount not less than $2,017,500,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) eligibility criteria to ensure that any loan prepayment activity required to be carried out under this subsection will be directed to those cooperative borrowers in greatest need of the benefits associated with prepayment, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assignability and transferability of guarantees of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any guarantee of a loan prepaid under this section shall be fully assignable under the provisions of section 936 of this title and transferable.

Each reference in this subchapter to capital stock, or to class B, or class C stock, shall include also the special fund equivalents of such stock, and to the extent permitted under the laws of the jurisdiction in which such organization is organized, a holder of special fund equivalents of class B, or class C stock, shall have the same rights and status as a holder of class B or class C stock, respectively. The rights and obligations of the telephone bank in respect of such special fund equivalent shall be identical to its rights and obligations in respect of class B or class C stock, respectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Patronage refunds from remaining earnings after provision for operating expenses, reserves for losses, payments in lieu of taxes, and returns on class A and C stock</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After payment of all operating expenses of the telephone bank, including interest on its telephone debentures, setting aside appropriate funds for the reserve for loan losses, and making payments in lieu of taxes, and returns on class A stock as provided in subsection (c) of this section, and on class C stock, the Telephone Bank Board shall annually set aside the remaining earnings of the telephone bank for patronage refunds in accordance with the bylaws of the telephone bank.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Investment of RTB Equity Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Governor of the telephone bank may invest in obligations of the United States the amounts in the account in the Treasury of the United States numbered 12X8139 (known as the &ldquo;RTB Equity Fund&rdquo;).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Governor of the telephone bank shall make loans on behalf of the telephone bank, to the extent that there are qualifying applications therefor, subject only to limitations as to amounts authorized for loans and advances as may be imposed by law enacted by the Congress of the United States for loans to be made in any one year, and in conformance with policies approved by the Telephone Bank Board, to corporations and public bodies which have received a loan or loan commitment pursuant to section 922 of this title, or which have been certified by the Secretary to be eligible for such a loan or loan commitment, (1) for the same purposes and under the same limitations for which loans may be made under section 922 of this title, (2) for the acquisition, purchase, and installation of telephone lines, systems, and facilities (other than buildings used primarily for administrative purposes, vehicles not used primarily in construction, and customer premise equipment) related to the furnishing, improvement, or extension of rural telecommunications service, and (3) for the purchase of class B stock required to be purchased under section 946(d) of this title but not for the purchase of class C stock, subject, as to the purposes set forth in (2) hereof, to the following provisos: That in the case of any such loan for the acquisition of telephone lines, facilities, or systems, the acquisition shall be approved by the Secretary, the location and character thereof shall be such as to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, or financial stability of the telephone system of the borrower, and in respect of exchange facilities for local services, the size of each acquisition shall not be greater than the borrower's existing system at the time it receives its first loan from the telephone bank, taking into account the number of subscribers served, miles of line, and plant investment. Loans and advances made under this section shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions of loans; restrictions on loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans under this section shall be on such terms and conditions as the Governor of the telephone bank shall determine, subject, however, to the following restrictions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amortization period</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preference in loans; election of loans for telephone system with certain subscriber density per mile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds to be loaned under this chapter to any borrower shall be loaned under this section in preference to section 922 of this title if the borrower is eligible for such a loan and funds are available therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of law, all loans made pursuant to this chapter for facilities for telephone systems with an average subscriber density of three or fewer per mile shall be made under section 922 of this title; but this provision shall not preclude the making of such loans from the telephone bank at the election of the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Loans under this section shall bear interest at the &ldquo;cost of money rate&rdquo;. The cost of money rate is defined as the average cost of moneys to the telephone bank as determined by the Governor, but not less than 5 per centum per annum.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The rate determined under this subparagraph shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the period beginning on the date the advance is made and ending at the close of the fiscal year in which the advance is made, <!-- PDFPage:473 -->the average yield (on the date of the advance) on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a final maturity comparable to the final maturity of the advance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) after the fiscal year in which the advance is made, the cost of money rate for such fiscal year, as determined under subparagraph (D).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of amount and method of security</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of, and method of security used to secure, a loan or loan guarantee under this section, the Secretary shall consider reducing the security in a rural area that does not have broadband service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Use of loan proceeds to refinance loans for deployment of broadband service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the proceeds of any loan made or guaranteed by the Secretary under this chapter may be used by the recipient of the loan for the purpose of refinancing an outstanding obligation of the recipient on another telecommunications loan made under this chapter if the use of the proceeds for that purpose will support the construction, improvement, or acquisition of facilities and equipment for the provision of broadband service in rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Reports</h4>
