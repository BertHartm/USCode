Except as otherwise provided by this subchapter, such loans shall be made under the same terms and conditions as are provided in section 904 of this title, for the purpose of financing the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the Secretary, in making such loans, shall give preference to persons providing telephone service in rural areas, to public bodies now providing telephone service in rural areas, and to cooperative, nonprofit, limited, dividend, or mutual associations: <em>And provided further</em>, That for a period of one year from and after October 28, 1949, applications for loans received by the Secretary from persons who on October 28, 1949, are engaged in the operation of existing telephone service in rural areas shall be considered and acted upon before action is taken upon any application received from any other person for any loan to finance the furnishing or improvement of telephone service to substantially the same subscribers. The Secretary in making such loans shall, insofar as possible, obtain assurance that the telephone service to be furnished or improved thereby will be made available to the widest practical number of rural users. When it is determined by the Secretary to be necessary in order to furnish or improve telephone service in rural areas, such loans may be made for the improvement, expansion, construction, acquisition, and operation of telephone lines, facilities, or systems without regard to their geographical location. The Secretary is further authorized and empowered to make loans for the purpose of refinancing outstanding indebtedness of persons furnishing telephone service in rural areas: <em>Provided</em>, That such refinancing shall be determined by the Secretary to be necessary in order to furnish and improve telephone service in rural areas: <em>And provided further</em>, That such refinancing shall constitute not more than 40 per centum of any loan made under this subchapter. Loans under this section shall not be made unless the Secretary finds and certifies that in his judgment the security therefor is reasonably adequate and such loan will be repaid within the time agreed, nor shall such loan be made in any State which now has or may hereafter have a State regulatory body having authority to regulate telephone service and to require certificates of convenience and necessity to the applicant unless such certificate from such agency is first obtained. In a State in which there is no such agency or regulatory body legally authorized to issue such certificates to the applicant, no loan shall be made under this section unless the Secretary shall determine (and set forth his reasons therefor in writing) that no duplication of lines, facilities, or systems, providing reasonably adequate services will result therefrom.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary is authorized to make and issue interim notes to the Secretary of the Treasury for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for discharging obligations of the fund and for making loans, advances and authorized expenditures out of the fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury. Such notes shall bear interest at a rate fixed by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield of outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having maturities comparable to the notes issued by the Secretary under this section. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and, for that purpose, the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include the purchase of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such interim notes to the Secretary of the Treasury shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase for resale obligations insured through the fund when offered by the Secretary. Such resales shall be upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine. Purchases and resales by the Secretary of the Treasury hereunder shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and not lending (budget outlays) of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary may, on an insured basis or otherwise, sell and assign any notes in the fund <!-- PDFPage:431 -->or sell certificates of beneficial ownership therein to the Secretary of the Treasury or in the private market. Any sale by the Secretary of notes individually or in blocks shall be treated as a sale of assets for the purposes of chapter 11 of title 31, notwithstanding the fact that the Secretary, under an agreement with the purchaser or purchasers, holds the debt instruments evidencing the loans and holds or reinvests payments thereon as trustee and custodian for the purchaser or purchasers of the individual note or of the certificate of beneficial ownership in a number of such notes. Security instruments taken by the Secretary in connection with any notes in the fund may constitute liens running to the United States notwithstanding the fact that such notes may be thereafter held by purchasers thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may provide financial assistance to borrowers for purposes provided in this chapter by guaranteeing loans, in the full amount thereof, made by the Rural Telephone Bank, National Rural Utilities Cooperative Finance Corporation, and any other legally organized lending agency, or by accommodating or subordinating liens or mortgages in the fund held by the Secretary as owner or as trustee or custodian for purchases of notes from the fund, or by any combination of such guarantee, accommodation, or subordination. The Secretary shall not provide such assistance to any borrower of a telephone loan under this chapter unless the borrower specifically applies for such assistance. No fees or charges shall be assessed for any such guarantee, accommodation, or subordination. With respect to guarantees issued by the Secretary under this section, on the request of the borrower of any such loan so guaranteed, the loan shall be made by the Federal Financing Bank and at a rate of interest that is not more than the rate of interest applicable to other similar loans then being made or purchased by the Bank. Guaranteed loans shall bear interest at the rate agreed upon by the borrower and the lender. Guaranteed loans, and accommodation and subordination of liens or mortgages, may be made concurrently with an insured loan. The amount of guaranteed loans shall be subject only to such limitations as to amounts as may be authorized from time to time by the Congress of the United States: <em>Provided</em>, That any amounts guaranteed hereunder shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States. As used in this subchapter a guaranteed loan is one which is initially made, <!-- PDFPage:435 -->held, and serviced by a legally organized lending agency and which is guaranteed by the Secretary hereunder. A guaranteed loan, including the related guarantee, may be assigned to the extent provided in the contract of guarantee executed by the Secretary under this subchapter; the assignability of such loan and guarantee shall be governed exclusively by said contract of guarantee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions for prepayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a borrower of a loan made by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed under section 936 of this title may prepay such loan (or any loan advance thereunder) by paying the outstanding principal balance due on the loan (or advance), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the loan is outstanding on July 2, 1986;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) private capital, with the existing loan guarantee, is used to replace the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the borrower certifies that any savings from such prepayment will be passed on to its customers or used to improve the financial strength of the borrower in cases of financial hardship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Charges on prepayment prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No sums in addition to the payment of the outstanding principal balance due on the loan may be charged as the result of such prepayment against the borrower, the fund, or the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disqualification for prepayment on finding of adverse affect on Federal Financing Bank</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A borrower will not qualify for prepayment under this section if, in the opinion of the Secretary of the Treasury, to prepay in such borrower's case would adversely affect the operation of the Federal Financing Bank.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall be effective in fiscal year 1987 only for any loan the prepayment of the principal amount of which will cause the cumulative amount of net proceeds from all such prepayments made during such year to exceed $2,017,500,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of permissible prepayments; establishment of eligibility criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall permit, subject to subsection (a) of this section, prepayments of principal on loans in fiscal year 1987 under this section or Public Law 99&ndash;349 in such amounts as to realize net proceeds from all such prepayments in fiscal year 1987 in an amount not less than $2,017,500,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) eligibility criteria to ensure that any loan prepayment activity required to be carried out under this subsection will be directed to those cooperative borrowers in greatest need of the benefits associated with prepayment, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other eligibility criteria as the Secretary determines are necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assignability and transferability of guarantees of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any guarantee of a loan prepaid under this section shall be fully assignable under the provisions of section 936 of this title and transferable. However, the Secretary may require that any such guarantee, if transfered&nbsp;<sup><a href="#936a_1_target" name="936a_1">1</a></sup> or assigned, be transferred or assigned to a loan or security that, if sold, will be grouped with nonguaranteed loans or securities and sold in a manner to ensure that such sale will not unreasonably compete with the marketing of obligations of the United States.</p>

Prepayments by a borrower hereunder shall be made not later than one year after the effective date of the merger, consolidation, or other transaction. The discount rate to be set by the Secretary for direct or insured loans prepayments hereunder shall be based on the current cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity to those being prepaid. If a borrower prepays using tax exempt financing, the discount shall be adjusted to make the discount equivalent to fully taxable financing. The borrower shall certify in writing whether the financing will be tax exempt and shall comply with such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish which are reasonable and necessary to implement this provision. As used in this section, the term &ldquo;direct loan&rdquo; means a loan made under section 904 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loans for prescribed purposes; requisite conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Governor of the telephone bank shall make loans on behalf of the telephone bank, to the extent that there are qualifying applications therefor, subject only to limitations as to amounts authorized for loans and advances as may be imposed by law enacted by the Congress of the United States for loans to be made in any one year, and in conformance with policies approved by the Telephone Bank Board, to corporations and public bodies which have received a loan or loan commitment pursuant to section 922 of this title, or which have been certified by the Secretary to be eligible for such a loan or loan commitment, (1) for the same purposes and under the same limitations for which loans may be made under section 922 of this title, (2) for the acquisition, purchase, and installation of telephone lines, systems, and facilities (other than buildings used primarily for administrative purposes, vehicles not used primarily in construction, and customer premise equipment) related to the furnishing, improvement, or extension of rural telecommunications service, and (3) for the purchase of class B stock required to be purchased under section 946(d) of this title but not for the purchase of class C stock, subject, as to the purposes set forth in (2) hereof, to the following provisos: That in the case of any such loan for the acquisition of telephone lines, facilities, or systems, the acquisition shall be approved by the Secretary, the location and character thereof shall be such as to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, or financial stability of the telephone system of the borrower, and in respect of exchange facilities for local services, the size of each acquisition shall not be greater than the borrower's existing system at the time it receives its first loan from the telephone bank, taking into account the number of subscribers served, miles of line, and plant investment. Loans and advances made under this section shall not be included in the totals of the budget of the United States Government and shall be exempt from any general limitation imposed by statute on expenditures and net lending (budget outlays) of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions of loans; restrictions on loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans under this section shall be on such terms and conditions as the Governor of the telephone bank shall determine, subject, however, to the following restrictions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amortization period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All loans made under this section shall be fully amortized over a period not to exceed fifty years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preference in loans; election of loans for telephone system with certain subscriber density per mile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Funds to be loaned under this chapter to any borrower shall be loaned under this section in preference to section 922 of this title if the borrower is eligible for such a loan and funds are available therefor. Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of law, all loans made pursuant to this chapter for facilities for telephone systems with an average subscriber density of three or fewer per mile shall be made under section 922 of this title; but this provision shall not preclude the making of such loans from the telephone bank at the election of the borrower.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Loans under this section shall bear interest at the &ldquo;cost of money rate&rdquo;. The cost of money rate is defined as the average cost of moneys to the telephone bank as determined by the Governor, but not less than 5 per centum per annum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) On and after December 22, 1987, advances made on or after December 22, 1987, under loan commitments made on or after October 1, 1987, shall bear interest at the rate determined under subparagraph (C), but in no event at a rate that is less than 5 percent per annum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The rate determined under this subparagraph shall be&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:449 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for the period beginning on the date the advance is made and ending at the close of the fiscal year in which the advance is made, the average yield (on the date of the advance) on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States having a final maturity comparable to the final maturity of the advance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) after the fiscal year in which the advance is made, the cost of money rate for such fiscal year, as determined under subparagraph (D).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Within 30 days after the end of each fiscal year, the Governor shall determine to the nearest 0.01 percent the cost of money rate for the fiscal year, by calculating the sum of the results of the following calculations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The aggregate of all amounts received by the telephone bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of class A stock, multiplied by the rate of return payable by the telephone bank during the fiscal year, as specified in section 946(c) of this title, to holders of class A stock, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The aggregate of all amounts received by the telephone bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of class B stock, multiplied by the rate at which dividends are payable by the telephone bank during the fiscal year, as specified in section 946(d) of this title, to holders of class B stock, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year. For purposes of the calculation under this subparagraph, such rate shall be zero.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The aggregate of all amounts received by the telephone bank during the fiscal year from the issuance of class C stock, multiplied by the rate at which dividends are payable by the telephone bank during the fiscal year, under section 946(e) of this title, to holders of class C stock, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv)(I) The sum of the results of the calculations described in subclause (II).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The amounts received by the telephone bank during the fiscal year from each issue of telephone debentures and other obligations of the telephone bank, multiplied, respectively, by the rates at which interest is payable during the fiscal year by the telephone bank to holders of each issue, each of which products is divided, respectively, by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v)(I) The amount by which the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year exceeds the aggregate of the amounts received by the telephone bank from the issuance of class A stock, class B stock, class C stock, and telephone debentures and other obligations of the telephone bank during the fiscal year, multiplied by the historic cost of money rate as of the close of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year, which product is divided by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;historic cost of money rate&rdquo;, with respect to the close of a preceding fiscal year, means the sum of the results of the following calculations: The amounts advanced by the telephone bank in each fiscal year during the period beginning with fiscal year 1974 and ending with the preceding fiscal year, multiplied, respectively, by the cost of money rate for the fiscal year (as set forth in the table in subparagraph (E)) for fiscal years 1974 through 1987, and as determined by the Governor under this subparagraph for fiscal years after fiscal year 1987), each of which products is divided, respectively, by the aggregate of the amounts advanced by the telephone bank during the period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) For purposes of subparagraph (D)(II), the cost of money rate for the fiscal years in which each advance was made shall be as set forth in the following table:</p>

If any borrower makes an election under this clause with respect to a loan, the Governor shall adjust the interest rate which applies to the unadvanced portion of the loan accordingly.</p>
