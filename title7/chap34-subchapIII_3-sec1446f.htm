<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) other oilseeds shall be established at such level as the Secretary determines is fair and reasonable in relation to the loan level available for soybeans, except in no event shall the level for such oilseeds (other than cottonseed) be less than the level established for soybeans on a per-pound basis for the same crop year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To ensure that producers have an equitable opportunity to produce an alternative crop in areas of limited crop options, the Secretary may limit, insofar as practicable, adjustments in the loan rate established under paragraph (2) applicable to a particular region, State, or county for the purpose of reflecting transportation differentials such that the regional, State, or county loan rate does not increase or decrease by more than 9 percent from the basic national loan rate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Marketing loan provisions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a formula to define the prevailing world market price for oilseeds (adjusted to United States quality and location); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a mechanism by which the Secretary shall announce periodically the prevailing world market price for oilseeds (adjusted to United States quality and location).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Loan deficiency payment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the level at which a loan may be repaid under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
