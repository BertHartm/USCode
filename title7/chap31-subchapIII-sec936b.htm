<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Discounted prepayment by borrowers of electric loans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a direct or insured loan made under this chapter shall not be sold or prepaid at a value that is less than the outstanding principal balance on the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On request of the borrower, an electric loan made under this chapter, or a portion of such a loan, that was advanced before May 1, 1992, or has been advanced for not less than 2 years, shall be sold to or prepaid by the borrower at the lesser of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Discount rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The discount rate applicable to the prepayment under this subsection of a loan or loan advance shall be the then current cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury for obligations of comparable maturity to the remaining term of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Tax exempt financing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a borrower prepays a loan under this subsection using tax exempt financing, the discount shall be adjusted to ensure that the borrower receives a benefit that is equal to the benefit the borrower would receive if the borrower used fully taxable financing. The borrower shall certify in writing whether the financing will be tax exempt and shall comply with such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish that are reasonable and necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Eligibility</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a borrower that prepaid a loan before October 21, 1992, at a discount rate greater than that provided by paragraph (3), shall not be eligible&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to apply for or receive direct or insured loans described in clause (i) until the borrower has repaid to the Federal Government the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) the amount (if any) by which the discount the borrower received by reason of the prepayment exceeds the discount the borrower would have received had the discount been based on the cost of funds to the Department of the Treasury at the time of the prepayment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) interest on the amount described in item (aa), for the period beginning on the date of the prepayment and ending on the date of the repayment, at a rate equal to the average annual cost of borrowing by the Department of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effect on existing agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a borrower and the Secretary have entered into an agreement with respect to a prepayment occurring before October 21, 1992, this paragraph shall supersede any provision in the agreement relating to the restoration of eligibility for loans under this chapter.</p>
