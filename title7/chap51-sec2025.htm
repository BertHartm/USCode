<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (k) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to pay to each State agency an amount equal to 50 per centum of all administrative costs involved in each State agency's operation of the food stamp program, which costs shall include, but not be limited to, the cost of (1) the certification of applicant households, (2) the acceptance, storage, protection, control, and accounting of coupons after their delivery to receiving points within the State, (3) the issuance of coupons to all eligible households, (4) food stamp informational activities, including those undertaken under section 2020(e)(1)(A) of this title, but not including recruitment activities, (5) fair hearings, (6) automated data processing and information retrieval systems subject to the conditions set forth in subsection (g) of this section, (7) food stamp program investigations and prosecutions, and (8) implementing and operating the immigration status verification system established under section 1137(d) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&ndash;7(d)): <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary is authorized at the Secretary's discretion to pay any State agency administering the food stamp program on all or part of an Indian reservation under section 2020(d) of this title or in a Native village within the State of Alaska identified in section 1610(b) of title 43.<sup><a href="#2025_1_target" name="2025_1">1</a></sup> such amounts for administrative costs as the Secretary determines to be necessary for effective operation of the food stamp program, as well as to permit each State to retain 35 percent of the value of all funds or allotments recovered or collected pursuant to sections 2015(b) and 2022(c) of this title and 20 percent of the value of any other funds or allotments recovered or collected, except the value of funds or allotments recovered or collected that arise from an error of a State agency. The officials responsible for making determinations of ineligibility under this chapter shall not receive or benefit from revenues retained by the State under the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Work supplementation or support program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) &ldquo;Work supplementation or support program&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the term &ldquo;work supplementation or support program&rdquo; means a program under which, as determined by the Secretary, public assistance (including any benefits provided under a program established by the State and the food stamp program) is provided to an employer to be used for hiring and employing a public assistance recipient who was not employed by the employer at the time the public assistance recipient entered the program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State agency may elect to use an amount equal to the allotment that would otherwise be issued to a household under the food stamp program, but for the operation of this subsection, for the purpose of subsidizing or supporting a job under a work supplementation or support program established by the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State agency makes an election under paragraph (2) and identifies each household that participates in the food stamp program that contains an individual who is participating in the work supplementation or support program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to the value of the allotment that the household would be eligible to receive but for the operation of this subsection;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) sections 2014 and 2017(a) of this title, the amount received under this subsection shall be excluded from household income and resources; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the household shall not receive an allotment from the State agency for the period during which the member continues to participate in the work supplementation or support program.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1072 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Other work requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No individual shall be excused, by reason of the fact that a State has a work supplementation or support program, from any work requirement under section 2015(d) of this title, except during the periods in which the individual is employed under the work supplementation or support program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Length of participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State agency shall provide a description of how the public assistance recipients in the program shall, within a specific period of time, be moved from supplemented or supported employment to employment that is not supplemented or supported.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) System</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In carrying out the food stamp program, the Secretary shall carry out a system that enhances payment accuracy and improves administration by establishing fiscal incentives that require State agencies with high payment error rates to share in the cost of payment error.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment of Federal share of administrative costs for fiscal years before fiscal year 2003</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), with respect to any fiscal year before fiscal year 2003, the Secretary shall adjust a State agency's federally funded share of administrative costs under subsection (a) of this section, other than the costs already shared in excess of 50 percent under the proviso in the first sentence of subsection (a) of this section or under subsection (g) of this section, by increasing that share of all such administrative costs by 1 percentage point to a maximum of 60 percent of all such administrative costs for each full 1/10 of a percentage point by which the payment error rate is less than 6 percent.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Only States with a rate of invalid decisions in denying eligibility that is less than a nationwide percentage that the Secretary determines to be reasonable shall be entitled to the adjustment under clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Establishment of liability amount for fiscal year 2003 and thereafter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to fiscal year 2004 and any fiscal year thereafter for which the Secretary determines that, for the second or subsequent consecutive fiscal year, a 95 percent statistical probability exists that the payment error rate of a State agency exceeds 105 percent of the national performance measure for payment error rates announced under paragraph (6), the Secretary shall establish an amount for which the State agency may be liable (referred to in this paragraph as the &ldquo;liability amount&rdquo;) that is equal to the product obtained by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the value of all allotments issued by the State agency in the fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the difference between&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) require that a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the liability amount established for the fiscal year be used by the State agency for new investment, approved by the Secretary, to improve administration by the State agency of the food stamp program (referred to in this paragraph as the &ldquo;new investment amount&rdquo;), which new investment amount shall not be matched by Federal funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) designate a portion, not to exceed 50 percent, of the amount established for the fiscal year for payment to the Secretary in accordance with subparagraph (E) (referred to in this paragraph as the &ldquo;at-risk amount&rdquo;); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) take any combination of the actions described in subclauses (I) through (III); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) make the determinations described in clause (i) and enter into a settlement with the State agency, only with respect to any waiver amount or new investment amount, before the end of the fiscal year in which the liability amount is determined under subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Payment of at-risk amount for certain States</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A State agency shall pay to the Secretary the at-risk amount designated under subparagraph (D)(i)(III) for any fiscal year in accordance with clause (ii), if, with respect to the immediately following fiscal year, a liability amount has been established for the State agency under subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Method of payment of at-risk amount</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) Remission to the Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of a State agency required to pay an at-risk amount under clause (i), as soon as practicable after completion of all administrative and judicial reviews with respect to that requirement to pay, the chief executive officer of the State shall remit to the Secretary the at-risk amount required to be paid.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1073 --><h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Alternative method of collection</h4>
<h4 class="subsubclause-head">(aa) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">If the chief executive officer of the State fails to make the payment under subclause (I) within a reasonable period of time determined by the Secretary, the Secretary may reduce any amount due to the State agency under any other provision of this section by the amount required to be paid under clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subsubclause-head">(bb) Accrual of interest</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Effect of State agency's wholly prevailing on appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a State agency begins required new investment under subparagraph (D)(i)(II), the State agency appeals the liability amount of the State agency, and the determination by the Secretary of the liability amount is reduced to $0 on administrative or judicial review, the Secretary shall pay to the State agency an amount equal to 50 percent of the new investment amount that was included in the liability amount subject to the appeal.</p>
