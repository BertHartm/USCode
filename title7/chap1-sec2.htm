<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) If, in its discretion, the Commission determines that a stock index futures contract, notwithstanding its conformance with the requirements in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, can reasonably be used as a surrogate for trading a security (including a security futures product), it may, by order, require such contract and any option thereon be traded and regulated as security futures products as defined in section 3(a)(56) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(56)] and section 1a of this title subject to all rules and regulations applicable to security futures products under this chapter and the securities laws as defined in section 3(a)(47) of <!-- PDFPage:15 -->the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(47)].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) No person shall offer to enter into, enter into, or confirm the execution of any contract of sale (or option on such contract) for future delivery of any security, or interest therein or based on the value thereof, except an exempted security under or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2_2_target" name="2_2">2</a></sup> section 3(a)(12) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12)] as in effect on January 11, 1983 (other than any municipal security as defined in section 3(a)(29) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(29)] on January 11, 1983), or except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph or subparagraph (D), any group or index of such securities or any interest therein or based on the value thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) The Board may at any time request any contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility to set the margin for any stock index futures contract (or option thereon), other than for any security futures product, at such levels as the Board in its judgment determines are appropriate to preserve the financial integrity of the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility, or its clearing system, or to prevent systemic risk. If the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility fails to do so within the time specified by the Board in its request, the Board may direct the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility to alter or supplement the rules of the contract market or derivatives transaction execution facility as specified in the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Subject to such conditions as the Board may determine, the Board may delegate any or all of its authority, relating to margin for any stock index futures contract (or option thereon), other than security futures products, under this clause to the Commission.</p>

The review shall be based on the examination of all information before the Board or the Commission, as the case may be, at the time the determination was made. The court reviewing the action of the Board or the Commission shall not enter a stay or order of mandamus unless the court has determined, after notice and a hearing before a panel of the court, that the agency action complained of was arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
