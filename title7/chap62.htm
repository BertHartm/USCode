<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) beef and beef products are basic foods that are a valuable part of human diet;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the production of beef and beef products plays a significant role in the Nation's economy, beef and beef products are produced by thousands of beef producers and processed by numerous processing entities, and beef and beef products are consumed by millions of people throughout the United States and foreign countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) beef and beef products should be readily available and marketed efficiently to ensure that the people of the United States receive adequate nourishment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the maintenance and expansion of existing markets for beef and beef products are vital to the welfare of beef producers and those concerned with marketing, using, and producing beef products, as well as to the general economy of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there exist established State and national organizations conducting beef promotion, research, and consumer education programs that are invaluable to the efforts of promoting the consumption of beef and beef products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) beef and beef products move in interstate and foreign commerce, and beef and beef products that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce of beef and beef products.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It, therefore, is declared to be the policy of Congress that it is in the public interest to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided herein, of an orderly procedure for financing (through assessments on all cattle sold in the United States and on cattle, beef, and beef products imported into the United States) and carrying out a coordinated program of promotion and research designed to strengthen the beef industry's position in the marketplace and to maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for beef and beef products. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to limit the right of individual producers to raise cattle.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">An order issued under section 2903(b) of this title shall contain the following terms and conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The order shall provide for the establishment and selection of a Cattlemen's Beef Promotion and Research Board. Members of the Board shall be cattle producers and importers appointed by the Secretary from (A) nominations submitted by eligible State organizations certified under section 2905 of this title (or, if the Secretary determines that there is no eligible State organization in a State, the Secretary may provide for nominations from such State to be made in a different manner), and (B) nominations submitted by importers under such procedures as the Secretary determines appropriate. In determining geographic representation for cattle producers on the Board, whole States shall be considered as a unit. Each State that has a total cattle inventory greater than five hundred thousand head shall be entitled to at least one representative on the Board. A State that has a total inventory of fewer than 500,000 cattle shall be grouped, as far as practicable, with other States each of which has a combined total inventory of not less than 500,000 cattle, into geographically contiguous units in a manner prescribed in the order. A unit may be represented on the Board by more than one member. For each additional million head of cattle within a unit, such unit shall be entitled to an additional member on the Board. The Board <!-- PDFPage:1246 -->may recommend a change in the level of inventory per unit necessary for representation on the Board and, on such recommendation, the Secretary may change the level necessary for representation on the Board. The number of members on the Board that represent importers shall be determined by the Secretary on a proportional basis, by converting the volume of imported beef and beef products into live animal equivalencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The order shall define the powers and duties of the Board, which shall be exercised at an annual meeting, and shall include only the following powers:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) To administer the order in accordance with its terms and provisions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) To make rules and regulations to effectuate the terms and provisions of the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) To elect members of the Board to serve on the Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) To approve or disapprove budgets submitted by the Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) To receive, investigate, and report to the Secretary complaints of violations of the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) To recommend to the Secretary amendments to the order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In addition, the order shall determine the circumstances under which special meetings of the Board may be held.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The order shall provide that the term of appointment to the Board shall be three years with no member serving more than two consecutive terms, except that initial appointments shall be proportionately for one-year, two-year, and three-year terms; and that Board members shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in performing their duties as members of the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The order shall provide that the Board shall elect from its membership ten members to serve on the Beef Promotion Operating Committee, which shall be composed of ten members of the Board and ten producers elected by a federation that includes as members the qualified State beef councils. The producers elected by the federation shall be certified by the Secretary as producers that are directors of a qualified State beef council. The Secretary also shall certify that such directors are duly elected by the federation as representatives to the Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Committee shall develop plans or projects of promotion and advertising, research, consumer information, and industry information, which shall be paid for with assessments collected by the Board. In developing plans or projects, the Committee shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to the extent practicable, take into account similarities and differences between certain beef, beef products, and veal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) ensure that segments of the beef industry that enjoy a unique consumer identity receive equitable and fair treatment under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Committee shall be responsible for developing and submitting to the Board, for its approval, budgets on a fiscal year basis of its anticipated expenses and disbursements, including probable costs of advertising and promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information projects. The Board shall approve or disapprove such budgets and, if approved, shall submit such budget to the Secretary for the Secretary's approval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The total costs of collection of assessments and administrative staff incurred by the Board during any fiscal year shall not exceed 5 per centum of the projected total assessments to be collected by the Board for such fiscal year. The Board shall use, to the extent possible, the resources, staffs, and facilities of existing organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The order shall provide that terms of appointment to the Committee shall be one year, and that no person may serve on the Committee for more than six consecutive terms. Committee members shall serve without compensation, but shall be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses incurred in performing their duties as members of the Committee. The Committee may utilize the resources, staffs, and facilities of the Board and industry organizations. An employee of an industry organization may not receive compensation for work performed for the Committee, but shall be reimbursed from assessments collected by the Board for reasonable expenses incurred in performing such work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The order shall provide that, to ensure coordination and efficient use of funds, the Committee shall enter into contracts or agreements for implementing and carrying out the activities authorized by this chapter with established national nonprofit industry-governed organizations, including the federation referred to in paragraph (4), to implement programs of promotion, research, consumer information, and industry information. Any such contract or agreement shall provide that&mdash;</p>

If continuation of the order is not approved by a majority of those voting in the referendum, the Secretary shall terminate collection of assessments under the order within six months after the Secretary determines that continuation of the order is not favored by a majority voting in the referendum and shall terminate the order in an orderly manner as soon as practicable after such determination.</p>
