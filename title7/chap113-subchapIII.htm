<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the crop year in which a base acres for peanuts adjustment under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) is first made, the owner of the farm shall elect to receive either direct payments and counter-cyclical payments with respect to the acreage added to the farm under this subsection or a prorated payment under the conservation reserve contract, but not both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prevention of excess base acres for peanuts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the sum of the base acres for peanuts for a farm, together with the acreage described in paragraph (2), exceeds the actual cropland acreage of the farm, the Secretary shall reduce the base acres for peanuts for the farm or the base acres for 1 or more covered commodities for the farm so that the sum of the base acres for peanuts and acreage described in paragraph (2) does not exceed the actual cropland acreage of the farm.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Selection of acres</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall give the owner of the farm the opportunity to select the base acres for peanuts or the base acres for covered commodities against which the reduction required by paragraph (1) will be made.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall proportionately reduce base acres on a farm for peanuts for land that has been subdivided and developed for multiple residential units or other nonfarming uses if the size of the tracts and the density of the subdivision is such that the land is unlikely to return to the previous agricultural use, unless the producers on the farm demonstrate that the land&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) remains devoted to commercial agricultural production; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is likely to be returned to the previous agricultural use.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) perform an evaluation on the supply and price of fruits and vegetables based on the effects of suspension of base acres under this section.</p>
