<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an adequate system for the efficient transient storage and movement of bulk agricultural commodities is essential to the overall success of the agricultural industry of the Nation, the development of rural areas of the Nation, and the economic stability of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the movement and storage of bulk agricultural commodities has been seriously and repeatedly impeded by shortages of transient storage facilities, adequate rail rolling stock, and the deterioration of many railroad track beds and rural highways throughout the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the efficient movement and storage of bulk agricultural commodities may be achieved and facilitated by the joint location at strategic points throughout the United States of transient storage facilities and multimodal terminal facilities constructed especially for the efficient shipment and receipt of agricultural commodities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the location of such facilities must be carefully planned to assure maximum benefits to producers of agricultural commodities and unprocessed agricultural products and utilization of the most efficient means of transporting bulk agricultural commodities for domestic and export markets.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may also make grants under this section available to two or more States acting together to develop a coordinated regional subterminal facilities plan (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the &ldquo;regional plan&rdquo;) for such region.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Grants made under this section to any State or region may not exceed 80 per centum of the cost of preparing the State or regional plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The State or regional plan shall prescribe in detail the actions such State or region proposes to take in order to (A) facilitate the efficient and competitive movement of bulk agricultural commodities from the points of production within such State or region to major market or export points, (B) provide adequate storage facilities for such commodities between points of production and market, (C) provide adequate receiving, storage, and loading facilities for any bulk agricultural commodity, and (D) assure that such facilities will be located at sites that will result in maximum benefits to local producers.</p>
