<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) engineering and research knowledge relating to biofuels or the production of inputs for biofuel production;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the range of species types and cropping practices proposed for study (including species types and practices studied using side-by-side comparisons of those types and practices);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the need for regional diversity among feedstocks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the importance of developing multiyear data relevant to the production of biomass feedstock crops;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the extent to which the project involves direct participation of agricultural producers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the extent to which the project proposal includes a plan or commitment to use the biomass produced as part of the project in commercial channels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) such other factors as the Secretary may determine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Energy-efficiency research and extension areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On-farm energy-efficiency research and extension activities funded under the Initiative shall focus on developing and demonstrating technologies and production practices relating to&mdash;</p>
