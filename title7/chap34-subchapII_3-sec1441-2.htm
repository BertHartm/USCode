<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) the producers have been determined by the Secretary (in accordance with section 1463(c) of this title) to be prevented from planting the crop or have incurred a reduced yield for the crop (due to a natural disaster) and the producers elect to devote a portion of the maximum payment acres for rice (as calculated under subparagraph (C)(ii)) equal to more than 8 percent of the rice acreage, to conservation uses; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) the producers elect to devote a portion of the maximum payment acres for rice (as calculated under subparagraph (C)(ii)) equal to more than 8 percent of the rice acreage, to alternative crops as provided in subparagraph (E).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Crop acreage and payment yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The rice crop acreage base and rice farm program payment yield of the farm shall not be reduced due to the fact that a portion of the permitted rice acreage of the farm was devoted to conserving uses (except as provided in subparagraph (E)) under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Other than as provided in clauses (i) through (vi), payments may not be made under this paragraph for any crop on a greater acreage than the acreage actually planted to rice.</p>

The Secretary may permit the acreage to be devoted to the production only if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the production is not likely to increase the cost of the price support program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the production is needed to provide an adequate supply of the commodity, or, in the case of commodities for which no substantial domestic production or market exists but that could yield industrial raw materials, the production is needed to encourage domestic manufacture of the raw material and could lead to increased industrial use of the raw material to the long-term benefit of United States industry.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Sesame and crambe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall permit, subject to such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, all or any part of acreage otherwise required to be devoted to conservation uses as a condition of qualifying for payments under subparagraph (D) to be devoted to sesame and crambe. In implementing this clause, if the Secretary determines that sesame or crambe are considered oilseeds under section 1446f of this title, the Secretary shall provide that, in order to receive payments under subparagraph (D), the producers shall agree to forgo eligibility to receive a loan under section 1446f of this title for the crop of sesame or crambe produced on the farm.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:660 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Agricultural resources conservation program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making a determination under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall take into consideration the number of acres placed in the agricultural resources conservation program established under subtitle D of title XII of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3831 et seq.).</p>

For the purpose of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;total disappearance&rdquo; means all rice utilization, including total domestic, total export, and total residual disappearance.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Acreage devoted to conservation uses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A number of acres on the farm shall be devoted to conservation uses, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary. Such number shall be determined by multiplying the rice crop acreage base by the percentage reduction required by the Secretary. The number of acres so determined is hereafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;reduced acreage&rdquo;. The remaining acreage is hereafter in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;permitted acreage&rdquo;. Permitted acreage may be adjusted by the Secretary as provided in paragraph (3) and in section 1464 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Individual farm program acreage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c) of this section, the individual farm program acreage shall be the acreage planted on the farm to rice for harvest within the permitted rice acreage for the farm as established under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the amount of the deficiency payment that the producers are otherwise eligible to receive under subsection (c) of this section shall be reduced, for each acre (or portion thereof) that is planted to the designated crop, by an amount equal to the deficiency payment that would be made with respect to a number of acres of the crop that the Secretary considers appropriate, except that if the producers on the farm are participating in a program established for more than one program crop, the amount of the reduction shall be determined by prorating the reduction based on the acreage planted or considered planted on the farm to all of such program crops; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the Secretary shall ensure that reductions in deficiency payments under subclause (I) are sufficient to ensure that this subparagraph will result in no additional cost to the Commodity Credit Corporation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:661 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Targeted option payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the Secretary implements an acreage limitation program with respect to any of the 1991 through 1995 crops of rice and announces an acreage limitation percentage of 20 percent or less, the Secretary may make available to producers on a farm who do not receive payments under subsection (c)(1)(D) of this section for such crop on the farm, adjustments in the level of deficiency payments that would otherwise be made available to the producers if the producers exercise the payment options provided in this paragraph.</p>

After the Secretary establishes the State technical committee for the State pursuant to section 1261 of the Food Security Act of 1985 (16 U.S.C. 3861), the State committee shall consult with the technical committee (rather than the Soil Conservation Service State Conservationist) regarding whether the crops or practices will sufficiently protect the land from weeds and wind and water erosion.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Conserving crops</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amounts payable to producers under land diversion contracts may be determined through the submission of bids for the contracts by producers in such manner as the Secretary may prescribe or through such other means as the Secretary determines appropriate. In determining the acceptability of contract offers, the Secretary shall take into consideration the extent of the diversion to be undertaken by the producers and the productivity of the acreage diverted.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitation on diverted acreage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall limit the total acreage to be diverted under agreements in any county or local community so as not to affect adversely the economy of the county or local community.</p>
