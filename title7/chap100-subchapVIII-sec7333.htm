<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Operation and administration of program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an eligible crop described in paragraph (2), the Secretary of Agriculture shall operate a noninsured crop disaster assistance program to provide coverage equivalent to the catastrophic risk protection otherwise available under section 1508(b) of this title. The Secretary shall carry out this section through the Consolidated Farm Service Agency (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible crops</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this section, the term &ldquo;eligible crop&rdquo; means each commercial crop or other agricultural commodity (except livestock)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for which catastrophic risk protection under section 1508(b) of this title is not available; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that is produced for food or fiber.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Crops specifically included</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;eligible crop&rdquo; shall include floricultural, ornamental nursery, and Christmas tree crops, turfgrass sod, seed crops, aquaculture (including ornamental fish), and industrial crops.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cause of loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To qualify for assistance under this section, the losses of the noninsured commodity shall be due to drought, flood, or other natural disaster, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application for noninsured crop disaster assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Timely application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To be eligible for assistance under this section, a producer shall submit an application for noninsured crop disaster assistance at a local office of the Department. The application shall be in such form, contain such information, and be submitted at such time as the Secretary may require.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer shall provide records, as required by the Secretary, of crop acreage, acreage yields, and production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Acreage reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer shall provide reports on acreage planted or prevented from being planted, as required by the Secretary, by the designated acreage reporting date for the crop and location as established by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loss requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required area loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer of an eligible crop shall not receive noninsured crop disaster assistance unless the average yield for that crop, or an equivalent measure in the event yield data are not available, in an area falls below 65 percent of the expected area yield, as established by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prevented planting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make a prevented planting noninsured crop disaster assistance payment if the producer is prevented from planting more than 35 percent of the acreage intended for the eligible crop because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduced yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make a reduced yield noninsured crop disaster assistance payment to a producer if the total quantity of the eligible crop that the producer is able to harvest on any farm is, because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster as determined by the Secretary, less than 50 percent of the expected individual yield for the crop, as determined by the Secretary, factored for the interest of the producer for the crop.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make available to a producer eligible for noninsured assistance under this section a payment computed by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the quantity that is less than 50 percent of the established yield for the crop; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) in the case of each of the 1996 through 1998 crop years, 60 percent of the average market price for the crop (or any comparable coverage determined by the Secretary); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of each of the 1999 and subsequent crop years, 55 percent of the average market price for the crop (or any comparable coverage determined by the Secretary); by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a payment rate for the type of crop (as determined by the Secretary) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a crop that is produced with a significant and variable harvesting expense, reflects the decreasing cost incurred in the production cycle for the crop that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) harvested;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) planted but not harvested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) prevented from being planted because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster (as determined by the Secretary); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a crop that is not produced with a significant and variable harvesting expense, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1524 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Actual production history</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall determine yield coverage using the actual production history of the producer over a period of not less than the 4 previous consecutive crop years and not more than 10 consecutive crop years. Subject to paragraph (3), the yield for the year in which noninsured crop disaster assistance is sought shall be equal to the average of the actual production history of the producer during the period considered.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assignment of yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a producer does not submit adequate documentation of production history to determine a crop yield under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall assign to the producer a yield equal to not less than 65 percent of the transitional yield of the producer (adjusted to reflect actual production reflected in the records acceptable to the Secretary for continuous years), as specified in regulations issued by the Secretary based on production history requirements.</p>

If the Secretary determines that the documentation provided is not sufficient, the Secretary may require documenting proof that the crop, had the crop been harvested, could have been marketed at a reasonable price.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a producer who produces a crop on a farm located in a county described in clause (i) may not obtain an assigned yield.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the Administrator approves the recommendation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on receipt of subsequent assigned yield</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A producer who receives an assigned yield for the current year of a natural disaster because required production records were not submitted to the local office of the Department shall not be eligible for an assigned yield for the year of the next natural disaster unless the required production records of the previous 1 or more years (as applicable) are provided to the local office.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Yield variations due to different farming practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall ensure that noninsured crop disaster assistance accurately reflects significant yield variations due to different farming practices, such as between irrigated and nonirrigated acreage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Contract payments</h4>
