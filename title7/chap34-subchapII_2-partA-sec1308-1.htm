<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prevention of creation of entities to qualify as separate persons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of preventing the use of multiple legal entities to avoid the effective application of the payment limitations under section 1308 of this title:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A person (as defined in section 1308(5)(B)(i) of this title) that receives farm program payments (as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this section as being subject to limitation) for a crop year under the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) may not also hold, directly or indirectly, substantial beneficial interests in more than two entities (as defined in section 1308(5)(B)(i)(II) of this title) engaged in farm operations that also receive such payments as separate persons, for the purposes of the application of the limitations under section 1308 of this title. A person that does not receive such payments for a crop year may not hold, directly or indirectly, substantial beneficial interests in more than three entities that receive such payments as separate persons, for the purposes of the application of the limitations under section 1308 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimal beneficial interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of this subsection, a beneficial interest in any entity that is less than 10 percent of all beneficial interests in such entity combined shall not be considered a substantial beneficial interest, unless the Secretary determines, on a case-by-case basis, that a smaller percentage should apply to one or more beneficial interests to ensure that the purpose of this subsection is achieved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notification by entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To facilitate administration of this subsection, each entity receiving such payments as a separate person shall notify each individual or other entity that acquires or holds a substantial beneficial interest in it of the requirements and limitations under this subsection. Each such entity receiving payments shall provide to the Secretary of Agriculture, at such times and in such manner as prescribed by the Secretary, the name and social security number of each individual, or the name and taxpayer identification number of each entity, that holds or acquires a substantial beneficial interest.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notification of interest</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a person is notified that the person holds substantial beneficial interests in more than the number of entities receiving payments that is permitted under this subsection for the purposes of the application of the limitations under section 1308 of this title, the person immediately shall notify the Secretary, designating those entities that should be considered as permitted entities for the person for purposes of applying the limitations. Each remaining entity in which the person holds a substantial beneficial interest shall be subject to reductions in the payments to the entity subject to limitation under section 1308 of this title in accordance with this subparagraph. Each such payment applicable to the entity shall be reduced by an amount that bears the same relation to the full payment that the person's beneficial interest in <!-- PDFPage:485 -->the entity bears to all beneficial interests in the entity combined. Before making such reductions, the Secretary shall notify all individuals or entities affected thereby and permit them to adjust among themselves their interests in the designated entity or entities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice not provided</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the person does not so notify the Secretary, all entities in which the person holds substantial beneficial interests shall be subject to reductions in the per person limitations under section 1308 of this title in the manner described in subparagraph (A). Before making such reductions, the Secretary shall notify all individuals or entities affected thereby and permit them to adjust among themselves their interests in the designated entity or entities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments limited to active farmers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To be separately eligible for farm program payments (as described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1308 of this title as being subject to limitation) under the Agricultural Act of 1949 [7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.] with respect to a particular farming operation (whether in the person's own right or as a partner in a general partnership, a grantor of a revocable trust, a participant in a joint venture, or a participant in a similar entity (as determined by the Secretary) that is the producer of the crops involved), a person must be an individual or entity described in section 1308(5)(B)(i) of this title and actively engaged in farming with respect to such operation, as provided under paragraphs (2), (3), and (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) General classes actively engaged in farming</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) personal labor or active personal management;</p>
