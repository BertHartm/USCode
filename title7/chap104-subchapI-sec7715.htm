<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) prohibit or restrict the movement within a State of any plant, biological control organism, plant product, article, or means of conveyance when the Secretary determines that the prohibition or restriction is necessary to prevent the dissemination of the plant pest or noxious weed or to eradicate the plant pest or noxious weed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required finding of emergency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may take action under this section only upon finding, after review and consultation with the Governor or other appropriate official of the State affected, that the measures being taken by the State are inadequate to eradicate the plant pest or noxious weed.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may pay compensation to any person for economic losses incurred by the person as a result of action taken by the Secretary under this section.
