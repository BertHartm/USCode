<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">2000&mdash;Pub. L. 106&ndash;554 substituted &ldquo;registered entity&rdquo; for &ldquo;contract market&rdquo; in two places.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:81 --><p class="note-body">1992&mdash;Pub. L. 102&ndash;546 made technical amendment to references to sections 9 and 15 of this title to reflect change in reference to corresponding section of original act and substituted &ldquo;the higher of $100,000 or triple the monetary gain to such person&rdquo; for &ldquo;$100,000&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1974&mdash;Pub. L. 93&ndash;463, &sect;&sect;103(a), 212(c), substituted &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; before &ldquo;may&rdquo; and substituted &ldquo;not more than $100,000&rdquo; for &ldquo;not less than $500 nor more than $10,000&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 93&ndash;463, &sect;103(a), provided for substitution of &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;Secretary of Agriculture&rdquo; except where such words would be stricken by section 103(b), which directed striking the words &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or&rdquo; where they appeared in the phrase &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the Commission&rdquo;. Because the word &ldquo;commission&rdquo; was not capitalized in the text of this section, section 103(b) did not apply to this section and therefore section 103(a) was executed, resulting in the substitution of &ldquo;the Commission or the commission&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Secretary of Agriculture or the commission&rdquo;.</p>
