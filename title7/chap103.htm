<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) many biomass feedstocks suitable for industrial processing show the clear potential for sustainable production, in some cases resulting in improved soil fertility and carbon sequestration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7)(A) grain processing mills are biorefineries that produce a diversity of useful food, chemical, feed, and fuel products; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) technologies that result in further diversification of the range of value-added biobased industrial products can meet a key need for the grain processing industry;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8)(A) cellulosic feedstocks are attractive because of their low cost and widespread availability; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) research resulting in cost-effective technology to overcome the recalcitrance of cellulosic biomass would allow biorefineries to produce fuels and bulk chemicals on a very large scale, with a commensurately large realization of the benefit described in paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) research into the fundamentals to understand important mechanisms of biomass conversion can be expected to accelerate the application and advancement of biomass processing technology by&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) increasing the confidence and speed with which new technologies can be scaled up; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) giving rise to processing innovations based on new knowledge;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the added utility of biobased industrial products developed through improvements in processing technology would encourage the design of feedstocks that would meet future needs more effectively;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) the creation of value-added biobased industrial products would create new jobs in construction, manufacturing, and distribution, as well as new higher-valued exports of products and technology;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12)(A) because of the relatively short-term time horizon characteristic of private sector investments, and because many benefits of biomass processing are in the national interest, it is appropriate for the Federal Government to provide precommercial investment in fundamental research and research-driven innovation in the biomass processing area; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) such an investment would provide a valuable complement to ongoing and past governmental support in the biomass processing area; and</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App.), and in order to stimulate the creation and early adoption of technologies needed to make biobased products and bioenergy cost-competitive in large national and international markets, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Current biobased product and bioenergy technology has the potential to make renewable farm and forestry resources major sources of affordable electricity, fuel, chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and other materials. Technical advances in these areas can create an expanding array of exciting new business and employment opportunities for farmers, foresters, ranchers, and other businesses in rural America. These technologies can create new markets for farm and forest waste products, new economic opportunities for underused land, and new value-added business opportunities. They also have the potential to reduce our Nation's dependence on foreign oil, improve air quality, water quality, and flood control, decrease erosion, and help minimize net production of greenhouse gases. It is the policy of this Administration, therefore, to develop a comprehensive national strategy, including research, development, and private sector incentives, to stimulate the creation and early adoption of technologies needed to make biobased products and bioenergy cost-competitive in large national and international markets.</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) The Council shall prepare annually a strategic plan for the President outlining overall national goals in the development and use of biobased products and bioenergy in an environmentally sound manner and how these goals can best be achieved through Federal programs and integrated planning. The goals shall include promoting national economic growth with specific attention to rural economic interests, energy security, and environmental sustainability and protection. These strategic plans shall be compatible with the national goal of producing safe and affordable supplies of food, feed, and fiber in a way that is sustainable and protects the environment, and shall include measurable objectives. Specifically, these strategic plans shall cover the following areas:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) biobased products, including commercial and industrial chemicals, pharmaceuticals, products with large carbon sequestering capacity, and other materials; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) biomass used in the production of energy (electricity; liquid, solid, and gaseous fuels; and heat).</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) To ensure that the United States takes full advantage of the potential economic and environmental benefits of bioenergy, these strategic plans shall be based on analyses of: (1) the economic impacts of expanded biomass production and use; and (2) the impacts on national environmental objectives, including reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Specifically, these plans shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) a description of priorities for research, development, demonstration, and other investments in biobased products and bioenergy;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) a coordinated Federal program of research, building on the research budgets of each participating agency; and</p>
