<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall set forth in each contract under the pilot program the terms and conditions for participation in the pilot program and the notice required by subsection (d) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an eligible crop described in paragraph (2), the Secretary of Agriculture shall operate a noninsured crop disaster assistance program to provide coverage equivalent to the catastrophic risk protection otherwise available under section 1508(b) of this title. The Secretary shall carry out this section through the Consolidated Farm Service Agency (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Agency&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible crops</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application for noninsured crop disaster assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Timely application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To be eligible for assistance under this section, a producer shall submit an application for noninsured crop disaster assistance at a local office of the Department.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make a prevented planting noninsured crop disaster assistance payment if the producer is prevented from planting more than 35 percent of the acreage intended for the eligible crop because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduced yields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make a reduced yield noninsured crop disaster assistance payment to a producer if the total quantity of the eligible crop that the producer is able to harvest on any farm is, because of drought, flood, or other natural disaster as determined by the Secretary, less than 50 percent of the expected individual yield for the crop, as determined by the Secretary, factored for the interest of the producer for the crop.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make available to a producer eligible for noninsured assistance under this section a payment computed by multiplying&mdash;</p>
