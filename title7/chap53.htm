<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2101. Congressional declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Cotton is the basic natural fiber of the Nation. It is produced by many individual cottongrowers throughout the various cotton-producing States of the Nation and also outside the United States. Cotton moves in the channels of interstate and foreign commerce and such cotton which does not move in such channels directly burdens or affects interstate commerce in cotton and cotton products. The efficient production of cotton and the maintenance and expansion of existing markets and the development of new or improved markets and uses is vital to the welfare of cottongrowers and those concerned with marketing, using, and processing cotton as well as the general economy of the Nation. The great inroads on the market and uses for cotton which have been made by manmade fibers have been largely the result of extensive research and promotion which have not been effectively matched by cotton research and promotion. The production and marketing of cotton by numerous individual farmers have prevented the development and carrying out of adequate and coordinated programs of research and promotion necessary to the maintenance and improvement of the competitive position of, and markets for, cotton. Without an effective and coordinated method for assuring cooperative and collective action in providing for, and financing such programs, individual cotton farmers are unable adequately to provide or obtain the research and promotion necessary to maintain and improve markets for cotton.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It has long been found to be in the public interest to have, or endeavor to have, a reasonable balance between the supply of and demand for cotton grown in this country. To serve this public interest the Congress has provided for the comprehensive exercise of regulatory authority in regulating the handling of such cotton supplemented by price-support programs with the objective of adjusting supply to demand in the interest of benefiting producers and all others concerned with the production and handling of cotton as well as the general economy of the country. In order for the objective of such programs to be effectuated to the fullest degree, it is necessary that the existing regulation of marketing be supplemented by providing as part of the overall governmental program for effectuating this objective, means of increasing the demand for cotton with the view of eventually reducing or eliminating the need for limiting marketings and supporting the price of cotton.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore declared to be the policy of the Congress and the purpose of this chapter that it is essential in the public interest through the exercise of the powers provided herein, to authorize and enable the establishment of an orderly procedure for the development, financing through adequate assessments on all cotton marketed in the United States and on imports of cotton, and carrying out an effective and continuous coordinated program of research and promotion designed to strengthen cotton's competitive position and to maintain and expand domestic and foreign markets and uses for United States cotton.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Referendum and cotton producer approval of orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct a referendum among persons who, during a representative period determined by the Secretary, have been engaged in the production of cotton for the purpose of ascertaining whether the issuance of an order is approved or favored by producers. No order issued pursuant to this chapter shall be effective unless the Secretary determines that the issuance of such order is approved or favored by not less than two-thirds of the producers voting in such referendum, or by the producers of not less than two-thirds of the cotton produced during the representative period by producers voting in such referendum and by not less than a majority of the producers voting in such referendum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Referendum on proposed amendment to order implementing provisions of 1990 amendments to this chapter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 2103 and 2104 of this title, not later than 150 days after the date of enactment of the Cotton Research and Promotion Act Amendments of 1990 [November 28, 1990], and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Secretary shall issue a proposed amendment to the order implementing the provisions of such Act, which shall become effective as provided in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall, within a period not to exceed 8 months after November 28, 1990, conduct a referendum among persons who have been cotton producers during a representative period, as determined by the Secretary, and persons who are importers of cotton and who, during a 12-month period ending not later than 90 days prior to the conduct of the referendum under this section imported a quantity of cotton in excess of the de minimis quantity (if any) established by the Secretary under section 2116(c)(2) of this title, for the purpose of ascertaining if a majority of those voting approve the proposed amendment to the order issued by the Secretary under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall announce the results of the referendum within 30 days after the date of such referendum. If the amendment is approved in the referendum, within a period not to exceed 90 days from the date of announcement of the results of such referendum, the Secretary shall publish the amendment to the order and regulations implementing the amendment provided for in this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Future referendums every five years or by request of cotton producers and importers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 2103 and 2104 of this title, once every five years after the date of the referendum provided for under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall conduct a review to ascertain whether a referendum is needed to determine whether producers and importers favor continuation of the amendment to the order provided for in the Cotton Research and Promotion Act Amendments of 1990 if such amendment is then in effect or, if such an amendment is not in effect, whether they favor approval of such amendment. The Secretary shall make a public announcement of the results of the review within 60 days after each fifth anniversary date of the referendum provided for under subsection (b) of this section. If the Secretary determines to provide for such a referendum, the Secretary shall conduct the referendum within 12 months after a public announcement of the determination to conduct the referendum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary does not provide for such a referendum on the Secretary's own initiative, the Secretary shall conduct such a referendum upon the request of 10 percent or more of the number of cotton producers and importers voting in the most recent referendum, except that, in counting such requests for a referendum, not more than 20 percent of such requests may be from producers from any one State or importers of cotton. Producers and importers may sign up to request such a referendum at the county office of the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, or county extension agent, or by mailing such a request to the Secretary, as prescribed in regulations. The sign-up period shall be for a period not to exceed 90 days, shall commence 60 days after the Secretary makes a public announcement of a determination not to provide for a referendum on the Secretary's own initiative, and shall be publicized by the Secretary and the Cotton Board immediately after such public announcement. The referendum shall be held within 12 months after the end of the sign-up period, if requested by the requisite number of persons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amendment to the order provided for in this subsection shall not be effective if it is disapproved by a majority of cotton producers and importers of cotton voting in the referendum.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The eligibility of each cotton producer organization to represent cotton producers of a cotton producing State to request the issuance of an order under section 2103 of this title, and to participate in the making of nominations under section 2106(b) of this title shall be certified by the Secretary and shall be based in addition to other available information upon a factual report submitted by the organization which shall contain information deemed relevant and specified by the Secretary for the making of such determination, including the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) Geographic territory within the State covered by the organization's active membership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) Nature and size of the organization's active membership in the State, proportion of total of such active membership accounted for by farmers, a map showing the cotton-producing counties in such State in which the organization has members, the volume of cotton produced in each such county, the number of cotton producers in each such county, and the size of the organization's active cotton producer membership in each such county;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) The extent to which the cotton producer membership of such organization is represented in setting the organization's policies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) Evidence of stability and permanency of the organization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) Sources from which the organization's operating funds are derived;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(f) Functions of the organization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(g) The organization's ability and willingness to further the aims and objectives of this chapter:</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block"><em>Provided, however</em>, That the primary consideration in determining the eligibility of an organization shall be whether its cotton farmer membership consists of a sufficiently large number of the cotton producers who produce a relatively significant volume of cotton to reasonably warrant its participation in the nomination of members for the Cotton Board. The Secretary shall certify any cotton producer organization which he finds to be eligible under this section, and his determination as to eligibility shall be final.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make such investigations as he deems necessary for the effective carrying out of his responsibilities under this chapter or to determine whether a handler or any other person has engaged or is about to engage in any acts or practices which constitute or will constitute a violation of any provision of this chapter or of any order, or rule or regulation issued under this chapter. For the purpose of any such investigation, the Secretary is empowered to administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, and documents which are relevant to the inquiry. Such attendance of witnesses and the production of any such records may be required from any place in the United States. In case of contumacy by, or refusal to obey a subpena issued to, any person, including a handler, the Secretary may invoke the aid of any court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which such investigation or proceeding is carried on, or where such person resides or carries on business, in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of books, papers, and documents; and such court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the Secretary, there to produce records, if so ordered, or to give testimony touching the matter under investigation. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district whereof such person is an inhabitant or wherever he may be found.</p>
