<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) not more than three months&rsquo; pay of such member upon such member's change of permanent station; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of an allotment made from such member's pay to a dependent if such member is assigned or scheduled for assignment to sea duty or other duty with a unit or command deployed or to be deployed outside the United States and the allotment is made by such member not more than sixty days before the scheduled date of the assignment of such member to such duty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, a member of a uniformed service who is on duty at a distant station where the pay and emoluments to which he is entitled cannot be disbursed regularly, may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, an advance of pay to a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside the United States, or other place designated by the Secretary of Defense, of not more than two months&rsquo; basic pay may be made to a member if the member or the dependents of the member are ordered evacuated by competent authority. An advance of pay under this subsection is not subject to the conditions under which advances of pay may be made under subsection (a) or (b). An advance may be made on the basis of the evacuation of a member's dependents only if all dependents of members of the uniformed services are ordered evacuated from the place where the member's dependents are located. In the case of a member with dependents, the payment may be made directly to dependents previously designated by the member. The Secretary concerned or his designee may waive any right of recovery of not more than one month's basic pay advanced under this subsection if he finds that recovery of the advance would be against equity and good conscience or against the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If a person to whom an advance of pay is made under subsection (a), (b), or (c) dies or is separated from his uniformed service, before liquidation of that advance, the amount re maining unliquidated at the time of his death or separation shall be credited to the account of the disbursing officer concerned. However, the unliquidated amount remains a debt of that person or his estate to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) As far as practicable, regulations for the administration of subsections (a)&ndash;(d) shall be uniform for all of the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Transportation, an advance of pay of not more than three months&rsquo; pay may be made to an officer of the Coast Guard who is ordered to sea duty or to or from shore duty beyond the seas. In addition, the Commandant of the Coast Guard may direct such advances as he considers necessary and proper to members of the Coast Guard stationed at distant stations where the pay and emoluments to which they are entitled cannot be paid regularly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the dislocation allowance authorized by section 407 of this title for a member of a uniformed service whose dependents are covered by section 405a(a) of this title may be paid in advance of the evacuation of the dependents and to the dependents designated by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of section 3324 of title 31, the Secretary concerned may, when the last day of the pay period falls on a Saturday, Sunday, or legal holiday, authorize the payment of pay and allowances to members of uniformed service under his jurisdiction on the preceding workday but not more than three days before the last day of that pay period. If a member dies after he has received an advance payment under this subsection, but before the last day of the pay period for which the payment is made, no part of the amount so advance is recoverable by the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Armed Forces Health Professions Scholarship program upon reporting for a period of active duty required by section 2121(c) of title 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, not more than one month's pay may be paid in advance to a member of the Senior Reserve Officers&rsquo; Training Corps who is ordered to field training or a practice required under section 2109 of title 10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) subject to subsections (c) and (d), provide all eligible members with an increase in each element of compensation, set forth in subsection (a), which is of the same percentage as the overall average percentage increase in the General Schedule rates of basic pay for civilian employees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Whenever the President determines such action to be in the best interest of the Government, he is authorized to allocate the overall average percentage of any increase described in subsection (b)(3) among the elements of compensation specified in subsection (a) on a percentage basis other than an equal percentage basis; however, the amount allocated to the element of monthly basic pay may not be less than 75 percent of the amount that would have been allocated to the element of basic pay under subsection (b)(3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under regulations prescribed by the President, whenever the President exercises his authority under paragraph (1) to allocate the elements of compensation specified in subsection (a) on a percentage basis other than an equal percentage basis, he may pay to each member without dependents who, under section 403(b) or (c) of this title, is not entitled to receive a basic allowance for quarters, an amount equal to the difference between (1) the amount of such increase under paragraph (1) in the amount of the basic allowance for quarters which, but for section 403(b) or (c) of this title, such member would be entitled to receive, and (2) the amount by which such basic allowance for quarters would have been increased under subsection (b)(3) if the President had not exercised such authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Subject to paragraph (2), whenever the President determines such action to be in the best interest of the Government, he may allocate the overall percentage increase in the element of basic pay that would otherwise be effective after any allocation made under subsection (c) among such pay grade and years-of-service categories as he considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making any allocation of an overall percentage increase in basic pay under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of the increase in basic pay for any given pay grade and years-of-service category after any allocation made under this subsection or under subsection (c) (or under both such subsections) may not be less than 75 percent of the amount of the increase in the element of basic pay that would otherwise have been effective with respect to such pay grade and years-of-service category under subsection (b)(3); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the overall percentage increase in the elements of compensation specified in subsection (a) in the case of any member of the uniformed services with four years or less service may not exceed the overall percentage increase in the General Schedule rates of basic pay for civilian employees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) Whenever the President plans to exercise his authority under subsection (c) or (d) with respect to any anticipated increase in the compensation of members of the uniformed services, he shall advise the Congress, at the earliest practicable time prior to the effective date of such increase, regarding the proposed allocation of such increase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The allocations of increases made under this section shall be assessed in conjunction with the quadrennial review of military compensation required by section 1008(b) of this title, and a full report shall be made to the Congress summarizing the objectives and results of those allocations.</p>

Such rates shall be established at a level sufficient to provide reimbursement of operating expenses and food costs to the appropriations concerned, but members of the uniformed services and civilians in a travel status receiving a per diem allowance in lieu of subsistence shall be charged at a rate of not less than $2.50 per day. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, if the Secretary determines that it is in the best interest of the United States, the Secretary may reduce a rate for meals established under this subsection by the amount of that rate attributable to operating expenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For the purposes of this section, payment for meals at the rates established under this section may be made in cash or, in the case of enlisted members or civilian employees, by deduction from pay. Members of organized nonprofit youth groups sponsored at either the national or local level, when extended the privilege of visiting a military installation or when residing at a military installation pursuant to an agreement in effect on June 30, 1986, and permitted to eat in the general mess by the commanding officer of the installation, shall pay the commuted ration cost of such meal or meals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Spouses and dependent children of enlisted members in pay grades E&ndash;1, E&ndash;2, E&ndash;3, and E&ndash;4 may not be charged for meals sold at messes in excess of a level sufficient to cover food costs.</p>
