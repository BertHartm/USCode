<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligation to reimburse the United States imposed under paragraph (1) is for all purposes a debt owed to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11 that is entered less than 5 years after the termination of an agreement under this section does not discharge the person signing such agreement from a debt arising under such agreement or under paragraph (1). This paragraph applies to any case commenced under title 11 after September 30, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) No bonus may be paid under this section to any person for a reserve obligation agreement entered into after December 31, 2003.</p>
