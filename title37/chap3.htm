<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;whether under temporary or permanent appointment&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;the following pay grades&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the various pay grades prescribed for commissioned officers by subsection (a) of this section, as follows&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;(other than a commissioned warrant officer)&rdquo; are inserted to conform to the definition of &ldquo;warrant officer&rdquo; in section 101(13) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for the word &ldquo;minimum&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (c) and (e), the words &ldquo;with two or less years of service computed under section 205 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;with under two cumulative years&rsquo; service&rdquo; and &ldquo;with under two cumulative years of service&rdquo;, in sections 308 and 232(e), respectively, of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;enlisted or appointed under the Army Aviation Cadet Act, as amended, or under the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942, as amended&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete and surplusage. Both of the cited acts were repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and replaced by various sections of title 10. Further reference is surplusage, however, since aviation cadets are not appointed or enlisted under any provision of law other than the sections of title 10 embodying the former Army Aviation Cadet Act and the Naval Aviation Cadet Act of 1942. The word &ldquo;basic&rdquo; is inserted for clarity, since the word &ldquo;pay&rdquo; as defined in section 101(21) of this revised title includes special and incentive pays. Incentive pay for aviation cadets is provided in section 301(b) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &ldquo;While on active duty&rdquo;, in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14, are omitted as covered by section 204 of this title which prescribes the conditions under which members of the uniformed services are entitled to basic pay. The words &ldquo;Unless he is entitled to the basic pay of a higher pay grade&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;or that of his grade, whichever is greater&rdquo; in section 6915(f) of title 10 and section 758a(f) of title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the words &ldquo;Except as provided by subsections (e) and (f)&rdquo; are inserted to reflect those subsections relating to enlisted aviation cadets or aviation pilots.</p>

<p class="note-body">[The citations to section 232(d) of existing title 37, above, are to the language of subsection (d) set forth in the codification note under section 232, rather than that erroneously set forth in the text of the section.]</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the last 27 words are substituted for the words &ldquo;or performance of the duties provided for by sections 5, 81, 94, 97 and 99 of the National Defense Act, as amended,&rdquo; to reflect the current citations. So much of the introductory clause as follows the exception is substituted for the 36 words preceding 1st proviso of 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37. The words &ldquo;on the active list&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the words &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title. The words &ldquo;(provided for or authorized in the National Defense Act, as amended, or in the Naval Reserve Act of 1938, as amended)&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the words &ldquo;provided by law&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;For the purposes of subsection (a)&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;active duty for a period of more than 30 days&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;extended active duty in excess of thirty days&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;call or&rdquo; are inserted to conform to the words &ldquo;called or&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;and allowances&rdquo; are omitted, since, under chapter 7 of this revised title, entitlement to allowances depends upon entitlement to basic pay. The last sentence is substituted for the last 38 words of the 2d proviso of the 1st sentence of section 232(d) of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;for the purposes of this section&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;and which entitles them to receive basic pay . . . in the service of the United States&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;pursuant to this section&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;or active duty for training&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the words &ldquo;active duty&rdquo; as defined in section 101(18) of this revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (f), the words &ldquo;is appointed&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;has been or may be commissioned&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;under the laws appointing such graduates to the Army&rdquo; and the last 16 words of section 308a of existing title 37 are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;to the date of his acceptance of and qualification under his commission&rdquo; are omitted, since the member concerned would continue to be entitled to basic pay after that acceptance and qualification. The words &ldquo;or the United States Naval Academy&rdquo; are inserted to reflect section 541 of title 10, under which graduates of that Academy may be appointed in the Army or the Air Force.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (i), the inclusion of the Coast Guard Reserve is based on the authority contained in section 755(c) of title 14.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the introductory clause is substituted for section 233(a) (introductory clause) of existing title 37. In clauses (1) and (2), the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;commissioned officer, commissioned warrant officer, warrant officer&rdquo; to conform to the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 101(11) of this revised title. In clause (1), the words &ldquo;Regular or Reserve component&rdquo; are omitted, since, under the definition of &ldquo;reserve component&rdquo; in section 102(k) of the source statute, those words are defined to include members without component status. Together, these categories compose the entire structure of any uniformed service. In clause (2)(F), the words &ldquo;a reserve component of a uniformed service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;the National Guard of the United States, or in the Organized Reserve Corps, or in the Officers&rsquo; Reserve Corps, or in the Enlisted Reserve Corps, or in the Medi<!-- PDFPage:18 -->cal Reserve Corps, or in the Medical Reserve Corps of the Navy, or in the Dental Reserve Corps of the Navy .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or in the Naval Reserve .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.or in the Air National Guard of the United States, or in the Air Force Reserve, or in the officers&rsquo; section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the enlisted section of the Air Force Reserve, or in the Air Corps Reserve .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. or in the Marine Corps Reserve, or in the Coast Guard Reserve, or in the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service,&rdquo; since all of the named organizations were or are reserve components. In clause (4), the words &ldquo;as it existed at any time before April 16, 1947&rdquo; are inserted for clarity, since the reference is intended to apply to the corps established by law before April 16, 1947. Service in the Army Nurse Corps or Navy Nurse Corps now existing would be included under clause (1) or (2), since there is now no legal distinction between the service of nurses and that of other members of the Army and Navy. In clause (6), the date &ldquo;January 1, 1961,&rdquo; is substituted for the words &ldquo;the effective date of this section,&rdquo; to reflect laws enacted after that effective date which authorized certain service to be credited for pay purposes. See, for example, Public Law 86&ndash;142. Clause (9) is substituted for section 233(b) (less proviso) of existing title 37. The last sentence is substituted for section 233(b) (proviso) of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the first 33 words of section 233(d) of existing title 37 are omitted as covered by the words &ldquo;are computed by adding&rdquo; in subsection (a). The words &ldquo;for any reason,&rdquo; in section 233(d) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(3), the words &ldquo;chapter 67 of title 10&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;title III of the Army and Air Force Vitalization and Retirement Equalization Act of 1948,&rdquo; since that title was repealed by section 53 of the Act of August 10, 1956, ch. 1041 (70A Stat. 641), and is now codified as chapter 67 of title 10 by section 1 of that Act.</p>
