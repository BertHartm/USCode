<p class="note-body">The definitions in clauses (1) and (2), (6)&ndash;(10), (14)&ndash;(21), and (24) reflect the adoption of terminology which, though undefined in the source statutes restated in this revised title, represent the closest practicable approximation of the ways in which the terms defined have been most commonly used, and so far as possible are identical to those used in title 10, United States Code, containing most of the basic law relating to the armed forces.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (3), the words &ldquo;and all Regular and Reserve components thereof&rdquo;, in section 231(a) of existing title 37, are omitted as surplusage. Section 231(j) of existing title 37 is omitted as covered by section 1 of title 1.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (4), that part of section 32(a) of existing title 37 relating other than to the enumeration of the armed forces is omitted as unnecessary. Section 231(k) of existing title 37 is omitted, since throughout the revised title references to members of the Army or Air Force without specification of component are specifically included when necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (11), the words &ldquo;flight officer&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. Section 231(c) (last sentence) of existing title 37 is omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (12), the definition of commissioned officer is broadened and restated to conform to the definition in section 101(15) of title 10. Corresponding changes are made throughout the revised title to correspond to the definition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (13), which is identical to section 101(16) of title 10, is substituted for section 231(e) of existing title 37. The words &ldquo;flight officer&rdquo; are omitted as obsolete. Section 231(h) of existing title 37 is omitted, since the defined term is not used in the revised title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Clause (22) is substituted for section 231(i) of existing title 37.</p>
<p class="note-body">In clause (23), section 231(b) (less 1st sentence) of existing title 37 is omitted as executed by the express coverage of members of the Fleet Reserve and Fleet Marine Corps Reserve.</p>

(23), to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because par. (24) already ended in a period and &ldquo;and&rdquo; appeared at end of par. (23), not par. (24).</p>
