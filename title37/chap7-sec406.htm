<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">may be provided transportation under this subsection for his dependents only by transportation in kind by the least expensive mode of transportation available or by a monetary allowance that does not exceed the cost to the Government of such transportation in kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) who is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) who is separated from the service or released from active duty for a medical condition affecting the member, as determined by the Secretary concerned;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) who is separated from the service or released from active duty because the period of time for which the member initially enlisted or otherwise initially agreed to serve has been reduced by the Secretary concerned and is separated or released under honorable conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) who is discharged under section 1173 of title 10; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) who is involuntarily separated from active duty during the nine-year period beginning on October 1, 1990.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The allowances authorized under this subsection may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this section, the term &ldquo;involuntarily separated&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 1141 of title 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in connection with a change of temporary or permanent station, a member is entitled to transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking) of baggage and household effects, or reimbursement therefor, within the weight allowances listed in subparagraph (C), without regard to the comparative costs of the various modes of transportation. Temporary storage in excess of 180 days may be authorized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, in the case of a permanent change of station in which the Secretary concerned has authorized transportation of a motor vehicle under section 2634 of title 10 <!-- PDFPage:108 -->(except when such transportation is authorized from the old duty station to the new duty station), the member is entitled to a monetary allowance for transportation of that motor vehicle&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) from the old duty station to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the customary port of embarkation which is nearest the old duty station if delivery of the motor vehicle to the port of embarkation is not made in conjunction with the member's travel to the member's port of embarkation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the customary port of embarkation which is nearest to the member's port of embarkation if delivery of the motor vehicle to the port of embarkation is made in conjunction with the member's travel to the member's port of embarkation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">whichever is most cost-effective for the Government considering all operational, travel, and transportation requirements incident to such change of station; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such monetary allowance shall be established at a rate per mile that does not exceed the rate established under section 404(d)(1) of this title.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In connection with the change of temporary or permanent station of a member in a pay grade below pay grade O&ndash;6, the Secretary concerned may authorize a higher weight allowance than the weight allowance determined under subparagraph (C) for the member if the Secretary concerned determines that the application of the weight allowance determined under such subparagraph would result in significant hardship to the member or the dependents of the member. An increase in weight allowance under this subparagraph may not result in a weight allowance exceeding the weight allowance specified in subparagraph (C) for pay grades O&ndash;6 to O&ndash;10. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation for the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy, and midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy shall be entitled, in connection with temporary or permanent station change, to transportation of baggage and household effects as provided in subparagraph (A). The weight allowance for cadets and midshipmen is 350 pounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The transportation and allowances authorized under paragraph (1) may be paid or provided to a member upon his separation from the service or release from active duty only if the member applies for the transportation and allowances not later than 180 days after the date of his separation or release from active duty. If a member to whom this paragraph applies has been authorized nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the 180-day period shall not begin until such authorization for nontemporary storage expires. This paragraph does not apply to a member to whom subsection (g)(1) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The allowances and transportation authorized by subsections (a) and (b) are in addition to those authorized by sections 404 and 405 of this title and are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subject to such conditions and limitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for such grades, ranks, and ratings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to and from such places;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">prescribed by the Secretaries concerned. Transportation of the household effects of a member may not be made by commercial air carrier at an estimated over-all cost that is more than the estimated over-all cost of the transportation thereof by other means, unless an appropriate transportation officer has certified in writing to his commanding officer that those household effects to be so transported are necessary for use in carrying out assigned duties, or are necessary to prevent undue hardship and other means of transportation will not fill those needs. However, not more than 1,000 pounds of unaccompanied baggage may be transported by commercial air carrier, without regard to the preceding sentence, under regulations prescribed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may be authorized in facilities <!-- PDFPage:109 -->of the United States, or in commercial facilities when it is considered to be more economical to the United States. However, the weight of baggage and household effects stored, plus the weight of the baggage and household effects transported, in connection with a change of station may not be more than the maximum weight limitations in regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned when it is not otherwise fixed by law. In the event a member's baggage and household effects exceed such maximum weight limitation, the Secretary concerned, if requested to do so by the member, may pay the costs for the nontemporary storage of that excess weight and collect the amount paid from the member's pay and allowances, or collect the amount in such other manner as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate. The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may not be authorized for a period longer than one year from the date the member concerned is separated from the service, retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, discharged, or released from active duty, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned for a member who, on that date, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment; or in the case of a member who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except in the case of a member who, on the date of his separation, discharge, or release, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment, the cost of the storage, for the period that exceeds one year, shall be paid by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of his dependents, baggage, and household effects, the Secretaries concerned may authorize the movement of the dependents, baggage, and household effects and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof (as the case may be), plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b). This subsection may be used only under unusual or emergency circumstances, including those in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member is performing duty at a place designated by the Secretary concerned as being within a zone from which dependents should be evacuated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) orders which direct the member's travel in connection with temporary duty do not provide for return to the permanent station or do not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from his permanent station; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the member is serving on permanent duty at a station outside the United States, in Hawaii or Alaska, or on sea duty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, transportation for dependents, baggage, and household effects of a member, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, is authorized if he dies while entitled to basic pay under chapter 3 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is involuntarily separated from active duty during the nine-year period beginning on October 1, 1990,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is, not later than one year from the date he is so retired, placed on that list, involuntarily separated, discharged, or released, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned, entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects to the home selected under section 404(c) of this title, and to a per diem for his dependents. In addition, baggage and household effects may be shipped to a location other than the home selected by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If baggage and household effects of a member are shipped to a place selected by a member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title or to a location other than the home selected by the member, or if transportation is provided for a member's dependents to a place selected by the member as his home under section 404(c) of this title that is not a place described in clause (A) or (B) of section 404(c)(2) of this title, and the costs of that shipment or transportation are in excess of those that would have been incurred if the shipment had been made or the transportation had been provided to a location in the United States (other than Alaska or Hawaii), the member shall pay that excess cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a member authorized to select a home under section 404(c) of this title accrues that right or any entitlement under this subsection but dies before he exercises it, that right or entitlement accrues to and may be exercised by his surviving dependents or, if there are no surviving dependents, his baggage and household effects may be shipped to the home of the person legally entitled to such baggage and effects. However, if baggage and household effects are shipped under circumstances described in paragraph (2) in which the member would have been required to pay the excess costs of that shipment, the surviving dependents or the person legally entitled to the baggage and household effects, as the case may be, shall pay that excess cost.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:110 --><p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) If the Secretary concerned determines that it is in the best interests of a member described in paragraph (2) or the member's dependents and the United States, the Secretary may, when orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) authorize the movement of the member's dependents, baggage, and household effects at the station to an appropriate location in the United States or its possessions or, if the dependents are foreign nationals, to the country of the dependents&rsquo; origin and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof, as the case may be, plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a member described in paragraph (2)(A), authorize the transportation of one motor vehicle, which is owned or leased by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of a dependent of the member, to that location by means of transportation authorized under section 2634 of title 10 or authorize the storage of the motor vehicle pursuant to subsection (b) of such section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the member's baggage and household effects are in nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the Secretary concerned may authorize their movement to the location concerned and prescribe transportation in kind or reimbursement therefor, as authorized under subsection (b). For the purposes of this section, a member's unmarried child for whom the member received transportation in kind to his station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof and who, by reason of age or graduation from (or cessation of enrollment in) an institution of higher education, would otherwise cease to be a dependent of the member while the member was serving at that station shall still be considered as a dependent of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member referred to in paragraph (1) is a member who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is serving at a station outside the United States or in Hawaii or Alaska;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) receives an administrative discharge under other than honorable conditions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is sentenced by a court-martial&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) to be confined for a period of more than 30 days,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to receive a dishonorable or bad-conduct discharge, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) to be dismissed from a uniformed service,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the sentence is approved under section 860(c)(2) of title 10.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A member traveling under orders who is relieved from a duty station is entitled to transportation for his dependents, baggage, and household effects, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, regardless of the time the dependents, baggage, or household effects arrive at their destination. Appropriations of the Department of Defense available for travel or transportation that are current when the member is relieved may be used to pay for the transportation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) The Secretary concerned may pay a monetary allowance to a member of the armed forces or a member of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service when the member participates in a program in which baggage and household effects of the member are transported by a privately owned or rental vehicle or in which a member provides all or a part of the labor in connection with the transportation of the baggage and household effects of the member (including packing, crating, and loading) under regulations of the Secretary concerned. The allowance is not limited to reimbursement for actual expenses and may be paid in advance of the transportation of the baggage and household effects. However, the amount of the allowance shall provide a savings to the United States when the total cost of the transportation is compared with the cost that would be incurred under subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may prescribe in any regulations authorizing the payment of a monetary allowance to a member who participates in a program in which the member provides all or a part of the labor in connection with the transportation of the baggage and household effects of the member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the extent to which payment to the member will be made for such labor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the manner in which liability will be allocated among the member, the United States, and the common carriers involved in the event of loss of or damage to any baggage or household effects packed, crated, or loaded by the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Appropriations available to the Department of Defense for providing transportation of household effects of members of the armed forces under subsection (b) shall be available to pay the monetary allowance authorized under paragraph (1) to such members. Appropriations available to the Department of Health and Human Services for providing transportation of household effects of members of the Commissioned Corps of the Public Health Service under subsection (b) shall be available to pay the monetary allowance authorized under paragraph (1) to such members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member with dependents who is ordered to make an overseas permanent change of station and who, in anticipation of his dependents accompanying him overseas, ships baggage and household effects to that overseas station, may be authorized a return shipment of the baggage and household effects if, after the shipment, the member's dependents are unable to accompany him overseas and the Secretary concerned determines that such inability was unexpected and uncontrollable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) For the purposes of this section, the residence of a dependent of a member who is a student not living with the member while at school shall be considered to be the permanent duty <!-- PDFPage:111 -->station of the member or the designated residence of dependents of the member if the member's dependents are not authorized to reside with the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m) No carrier, port agent, warehouseman, freight forwarder, or other person involved in the transportation of property may have any lien on, or hold, impound, or otherwise interfere with, the movement of baggage and household goods being transported under this section.</p>
