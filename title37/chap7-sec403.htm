<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled <!-- PDFPage:85 -->to basic pay is entitled to a basic allowance for quarters at the monthly rates prescribed in accordance with section 1009 of this title or as otherwise prescribed by law, according to the pay grade in which he is assigned or distributed for basic pay purposes. The allowance authorized by this section may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service with dependents is not entitled to a basic allowance for quarters as a member with dependents unless the member makes an annual certification to the Secretary concerned indicating the status of each dependent of the member. The certification shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as otherwise provided by law, a member of a uniformed service who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service, appropriate to his grade, rank, or rating and adequate for himself, and his dependents, if with dependents, is not entitled to a basic allowance for quarters. However, subject to the provisions of subsection (j), a member without dependents who is in a pay grade above pay grade E&ndash;6 and who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service, appropriate to his grade or rank and adequate for himself, may elect not to occupy those quarters and instead to receive the basic allowance for quarters prescribed for his pay grade by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) A member of a uniformed service without dependents who makes a permanent change of station for assignment to a unit conducting field operations is not entitled to a basic allowance for quarters while on that initial field duty unless his commanding officer certifies that the member was necessarily required to procure quarters at his expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service without dependents who is in a pay grade below pay grade E&ndash;7 is not entitled to a basic allowance for quarters while he is on sea duty. A member of a uniformed service without dependents who is in a pay grade above E&ndash;6 who is assigned to sea duty under a permanent change of station is not entitled to a basic allowance for quarters if the unit to which the member is ordered is deployed and the permanent station of the unit is different than the permanent station from which the member is reporting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) A member of a uniformed service who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service may not be denied the basic allowance for quarters if, because of orders of competent authority, his dependents are prevented from occupying those quarters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a reserve component without dependents who is called or ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation (other than a member who is authorized transportation of household goods under section 406 of this title as part of that call or order) may not be denied a basic allowance for quarters if, because of that call or order, the member is unable to continue to occupy a residence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which is maintained as the primary residence of the member at the time of the call or order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which is owned by the member or for which the member is responsible for rental payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Notwithstanding any other law (including those restricting the occupancy of housing facilities under the jurisdiction of a department or agency of the United States by members, and their dependents, of the armed forces above specified grades, or by members, and their dependents of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Public Health Service), a member of a uniformed service, and his dependents, may be accepted as tenants in, and may occupy on a rental basis, any of those housing facilities, other than public quarters constructed or designated for assignment to and occupancy without charge by such a member, and his dependents, if any. Such a member may not, because of his occupancy under this subsection, be deprived of any money allowance to which he is otherwise entitled for the rental of quarters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A member of a uniformed service without dependents who is in pay grade E&ndash;4 (four or more years&rsquo; service), or above, is entitled to a basic allowance for quarters while he is in a travel or leave status between permanent duty stations, including time granted as delay enroute or proceed time, when he is not assigned to quarters of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) An aviation cadet of the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard is entitled to the same basic allowance for quarters as a member of the uniformed services in pay grade E&ndash;4.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may make any determination necessary to administer this section with regard to enlisted members, including determinations of dependency and relationship, and may, when warranted by the circumstances, reconsider and change or modify any such determination. This authority may be redelegated by the Secretary concerned or his designee. Any determination made under this section with regard to enlisted members is final and is not subject to review by any accounting officer of the United States or a court, unless there is fraud or gross negligence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the basic allowance for quarters to which an enlisted member may be entitled as a member with dependents shall not, for such period as the Secretary concerned may prescribe, be contingent on the right of such member to receive pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations for the administration of this section, including definitions of the terms &ldquo;field duty&rdquo; and &ldquo;sea duty&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may deny the right to make an election under subsection (b) if he determines that the exercise of such an election would adversely affect a training mission, military discipline, or military readiness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k) Parking facilities (including utility connections) provided members of the uniformed services for house trailers and mobile homes not owned by the Government shall not be considered to be quarters for the purposes of this section or any other provision of law. Any fee es<!-- PDFPage:86 -->tablished by the Government for the use of such a facility shall be established in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance, services, and utilities and to amortize the cost of construction of the facility over the 25-year period beginning with the completion of such construction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>)(1) The Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation in the case of the Coast Guard when not operating as a service in the Navy, may allow the dependents of a member of the armed forces who dies in line of duty and whose dependents are occupying family housing provided by the Department of Defense, or by the Department of Transportation in the case of the Coast Guard, other than on a rental basis on the date of the member's death to continue to occupy such housing without charge for a period of 180 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary concerned may pay an allowance for quarters to the dependents of a member of the uniformed services who dies in line of duty and whose dependents are not occupying a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service on the date of the member's death or are occupying such housing on a rental basis on such date, or whose dependents vacate such housing sooner than 180 days after the date of the member's death. The amount of the allowance for quarters shall be the same amount that would be payable to the deceased member under sections 403, 403a, and 405 of this title if the member had not died. The payment of an allowance for quarters under this subsection shall terminate 180 days after the date of the member's death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a member of a uniformed service who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service and who is authorized a basic allowance for quarters solely by reason of the member's payment of child support, the amount of the basic allowance for quarters to which the member is entitled shall be equal to the difference between the basic allowance for quarters applicable to the member's grade, rank, or rating at the with-dependent rate and the applicable basic allowance for quarters at the without-dependent rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service shall not be entitled to a basic allowance for quarters solely by reason of the payment of child support if the monthly rate of that child support is less than the amount of the basic allowance for quarters computed for the member under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The application of this subsection to a member of a uniformed service shall not affect the entitlement of that member to a basic allowance for quarters at a partial rate under section 1009(c) of this title.</p>
