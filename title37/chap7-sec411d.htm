<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In the case of a member stationed outside the continental United States and the dependents of such a member, transportation under this section may be provided from the location of the member or dependents, at the time notification of the personal emergency is received, or the member's permanent duty station (and if the member's dependents reside at another overseas location and receive a station allowance, from that location)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a member stationed outside the continental United States whose dependents reside in the continental United States, transportation under this section may be provided for the member as described in paragraph (1) and for the dependents as described in paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Transportation under this section may be authorized only upon a determination that, considering the nature of the personal emergency involved, Government transportation is not reasonably available. The cost of transportation authorized under this section for a member, or the dependents of a member, may not exceed the cost of Government-procured commercial air travel between the applicable locations described in subsection (b).</p>
