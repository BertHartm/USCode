<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Entitlement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is entitled to a basic allowance for housing at the monthly rates prescribed under this section or another provision of law with regard to the applicable component of the basic allowance for housing. The amount of the basic allowance for housing for a member will vary according to the pay grade in which the member is assigned or distributed for basic pay purposes, the dependency status of the member, and the geographic location of the member. The basic allowance for housing may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service with dependents is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing as a member with dependents unless the member makes a certification to the Secretary concerned indicating the status of each dependent of the member. The certification shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing Inside the United States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall determine the costs of adequate housing in a military housing area in the United States for all members of the uniformed services entitled to a basic allowance for housing in that area. The Secretary shall base the determination upon the costs of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (3), the monthly amount of a basic allowance for housing for an area of the United States for a member of a uniformed service is equal to the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the monthly cost of adequate housing in that area, as determined by the Secretary of Defense, for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as the member; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 15 percent of the national average monthly cost of adequate housing in the United States, as determined by the Secretary, for members of the uniformed services serving in the same pay grade and with the same dependency status as the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The rates of basic allowance for housing shall be reduced as necessary to comply with this paragraph. The total amount that may be paid for a fiscal year for the basic allowance for housing under this subsection is the product of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:102 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount authorized to be paid for such allowance for the preceding fiscal year (as adjusted under paragraph (5)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the index of the national average monthly cost of housing for June of the preceding fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the index of the national average monthly cost of housing for June of the fiscal year before the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An adjustment in the rates of the basic allowance for housing under this subsection as a result of the Secretary's redetermination of housing costs in an area shall take effect on the same date as the effective date of the next increase in basic pay under section 1009 of this title or other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In making a determination under paragraph (3) for a fiscal year, the amount authorized to be paid for the preceding fiscal year for the basic allowance for housing shall be adjusted to reflect changes during the year for which the determination is made in the number, grade distribution, geographic distribution in the United States, and dependency status of members of the uniformed services entitled to the allowance from the number of such members during the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing within an area of the United States, the monthly amount of the allowance for the member may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area, changes in the national average monthly cost of housing, or the promotion of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) In the case of a member without dependents who is assigned to duty inside the United States, the location or the circumstances of which make it necessary that the member be reassigned under the conditions of low-cost or no-cost permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment, the member may be treated as if the member were not reassigned if the Secretary concerned determines that it would be inequitable to base the member's entitlement to, and amount of, a basic allowance for housing on the cost of housing in the area to which the member is reassigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing Outside the United States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may prescribe an overseas basic allowance for housing for a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside of the United States. The Secretary shall establish the basic allowance for housing under this subsection on the basis of housing costs in the overseas area in which the member is assigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing in an overseas area and the actual monthly cost of housing for the member is not reduced, the monthly amount of the allowance in an area outside the United States may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member. The monthly amount of the allowance may be adjusted to reflect changes in currency rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a member of the uniformed services authorized to receive an allowance under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned may make a lump-sum payment to the member for required deposits and advance rent, and for expenses relating thereto, that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) incurred by the member in occupying private housing outside of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) authorized or approved under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Expenses for which a member may be reimbursed under this paragraph may include losses relating to housing that are sustained by the member as a result of fluctuations in the relative value of the currencies of the United States and the foreign country in which the housing is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary concerned shall recoup the full amount of any deposit or advance rent payments made by the Secretary under subparagraph (A), including any gain resulting from currency fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of recoupment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing When Dependents Are Unable To Accompany Member</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A member of a uniformed service with dependents who is on permanent duty at a location described in paragraph (2) is entitled to a family separation basic allowance for housing under this subsection at a monthly rate equal to the rate of the basic allowance for housing established under subsection (b) or the overseas basic allowance for housing established under subsection (c), whichever applies to that location, for members in the same grade at that location without dependents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A permanent duty location referred to in paragraph (1) is a location&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to which the movement of the member's dependents is not authorized at the expense of the United States under section 406 of this title, and the member's dependents do not reside at or near the location; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at which quarters of the United States are not available for assignment to the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a member with dependents who is assigned to duty at a location or under circumstances that, as determined by the Secretary concerned, require the member's dependents to reside at a different location, the member shall receive a basic allowance for housing, as provided in subsection (a) or (b), as if the member were assigned to duty in the area in which the dependents reside, regardless of whether the member resides in quarters of the United States or is also entitled to a family separation basic allowance for housing by reason of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The family separation basic allowance for housing under this subsection shall be in addition to any other allowance or per diem that the member is otherwise entitled to receive under this title. A member may receive a basic allowance for housing under both paragraphs (1) and (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Assignment to Quarters</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a member of a uniformed service who is assigned to quar<!-- PDFPage:103 -->ters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service appropriate to the grade, rank, or rating of the member and adequate for the member and dependents of the member, if with dependents, is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member without dependents who is in a pay grade above pay grade E&ndash;6 and who is assigned to quarters in the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service, appropriate to the grade or rank of the member and adequate for the member, may elect not to occupy those quarters and instead to receive the basic allowance for housing prescribed for the member's pay grade by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A member without dependents who is in pay grade E&ndash;6 and who is assigned to quarters of the United States that do not meet the minimum adequacy standards established by the Secretary of Defense for members in such pay grade, or to a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service that does not meet such standards, may elect not to occupy such quarters or facility and instead to receive the basic allowance for housing prescribed for the member's pay grade under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary concerned may deny the right to make an election under paragraph (2) or (3) if the Secretary determines that the exercise of such an election would adversely affect a training mission, military discipline, or military readiness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A member with dependents who is assigned to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service may be paid the basic allowance for housing if, because of orders of competent authority, the dependents are prevented from occupying those quarters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Ineligibility During Initial Field Duty or Sea Duty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A member of a uniformed service without dependents who makes a permanent change of station for assignment to a unit conducting field operations is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing while on that initial field duty unless the commanding officer of the member certifies that the member was necessarily required to procure quarters at the member's expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), a member of a uniformed service without dependents who is in a pay grade below pay grade E&ndash;6 is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing while the member is on sea duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, the Secretary may authorize the payment of a basic allowance for housing to a member of a uniformed service without dependents who is serving in pay grade E&ndash;5 and is assigned to sea duty. In prescribing regulations under this subparagraph, the Secretary concerned shall consider the availability of quarters for members serving in pay grade E&ndash;5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding section 421 of this title, two members of the uniformed services in a pay grade below pay grade E&ndash;6 who are married to each other, have no other dependents, and are simultaneously assigned to sea duty are jointly entitled to one basic allowance for housing during the period of such simultaneous sea duty. The amount of the allowance shall be based on the without dependents rate for the pay grade of the senior member of the couple. However, this subparagraph shall not apply to a couple if one or both of the members are entitled to a basic allowance for housing under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Department of the Navy, shall prescribe regulation&nbsp;<sup><a href="#403_1_target" name="403_1">1</a></sup> defining the terms &ldquo;field duty&rdquo; and &ldquo;sea duty&rdquo; for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Reserve Members</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A member of a reserve component without dependents who is called or ordered to active duty in support of a contingency operation, or a retired member without dependents who is ordered to active duty under section 688(a) of title 10 in support of a contingency operation, may not be denied a basic allowance for housing if, because of that call or order, the member is unable to continue to occupy a residence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which is maintained as the primary residence of the member at the time of the call or order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which is owned by the member or for which the member is responsible for rental payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply if the member is authorized transportation of household goods under section 406 of this title as part of the call or order to active duty described in such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Defense shall establish a rate of basic allowance for housing to be paid to a member of a reserve component while the member serves on active duty under a call or order to active duty specifying a period of less than 140 days, unless the call or order to active duty is in support of a contingency operation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) <cap-smallcap>Aviation Cadets</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The eligibility of an aviation cadet of the Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, or Coast Guard for a basic allowance for housing shall be determined as if the aviation cadet were a member of the uniformed services in pay grade E&ndash;4.</p>

The authority of the Secretary concerned under this subsection may be delegated.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Parking facilities (including utility connections) provided members of the uniformed services for house trailers and mobile homes not owned by the Government shall not be considered to be quarters for the purposes of this section or any other provision of law. Any fees established by the Government for the use of such a facility shall be established in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of maintenance, services, and utilities and to amortize the cost of construction of the facility over the 25-year period beginning with the completion of such construction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A member assigned to duty in the continental United States if the Secretary of the uniformed service concerned determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the primary dependent of the member must reside in a high cost area in the continental United States by reason of the member's duty location or other circumstances; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it would be inequitable for the member's eligibility for the allowance to be determined on the basis of the duty location of the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>High Cost Area Defined</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An area is a high cost area for a fiscal year for purposes of this section if the uniformed services cost of living for that area for the base period exceeds the average cost of living in the continental United States for such base period by at least the threshold percentage. The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall establish the threshold percentage, except that the threshold percentage may not be less than 8 percent. The administering Secretaries shall prescribe a higher threshold percentage to be applied for a fiscal year when it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the total amount of the payments of the cost-of-living allowance made to members of the uniformed services under this section for such fiscal year does not exceed the total amount available to all uniformed services for that fiscal year for paying such allowance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Amount of Allowance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The cost-of-living allowance that may be paid to a member for a high cost area for a fiscal year shall be the amount that is equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the amount of the average spendable income determined applicable for the regular military compensation level of such member under subsection (g); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the percentage equal to the excess of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the threshold percentage applicable to such fiscal year under subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitation to One Allowance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If primary dependents of a member reside separately in different high cost areas&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member may be paid only one cost-of-living allowance under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the cost-of-living allowance payable to the member shall be the highest of the amounts computed under this section for such high cost areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Service Not Covered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A cost-of-living allowance may not be paid a member under this section for the days authorized for travel of the member in connection with a permanent change of duty station.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:110 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a reserve component is not eligible for a cost-of-living allowance under this section unless the member is on active duty under a call or order to active duty that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specifies a period of 140 days or more; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) states that the call or order to active duty is in support of a contingency operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Average Spendable Income</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall determine, using a methodology and assumptions that the Secretary considers appropriate, the amounts of average spendable income of members of the uniformed services for various ranges of regular military compensation. For purposes of this subsection, spendable income is the total amount of regular military compensation that is available for purchase of goods and services after allocation of amounts for taxes, insurance, housing, gifts and contributions, and savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Joint Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense and the other administering Secretaries shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Other Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;primary dependent&rdquo;, with respect to a member, means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the member's spouse; or</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, when dependents of members of the uniformed services are authorized or ordered to depart by competent authority, they may be authorized such allowances as the Secretary concerned determines necessary to offset the expenses incident to the departure. Allowances authorized by this section are in addition to those authorized by any other section of this title. Such allowances may be paid in advance. For the purposes of this section, a dependent &ldquo;authorized or ordered to depart by competent authority&rdquo; includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a dependent who is present at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station when the departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority and who actually moved to an authorized safe haven designated by that authority, whether such safe haven is at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station or elsewhere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a dependent who resides at or in the vicinity of a former duty station of the member following the assignment of the member elsewhere or who resides at or in the vicinity of a duty station (other than the duty station of the member) incident to orders in connection with an unaccompanied tour of duty of the member, if a departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority from the duty station at which or in the vicin<!-- PDFPage:118 -->ity of which the dependent resides and the dependent actually moves to an authorized safe haven designated by that authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a dependent who established a household at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station but who is temporarily absent therefrom for any reason when departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a dependent who was authorized to join the member and who departed from his former place of residence incident to joining the member but who, as a result of the departure of dependents, is diverted to a safe haven designated by competent authority or is authorized to travel to a place the dependent may designate, even though he was in the United States when the departure was authorized or ordered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, each member whose dependents are covered by subsection (a) is entitled to have one motor vehicle that is owned by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of the member or his dependents, transported at the expense of the United States to a designated place for the use of the dependents. When the dependents are permitted to rejoin the member, the vehicle may be transported at the expense of the United States to his permanent duty station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under paragraph (1) does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the member for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use. The amount reimbursed may not exceed $30 per day, and the rental period for which reimbursement may be provided expires after 7 days or on the date on which the delayed vehicle arrives at the authorized destination (whichever occurs first).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">may be provided transportation under this subsection for his dependents only by transportation in kind by the least expensive mode of transportation available or by a monetary allowance that does not exceed the cost to the Government of such transportation in kind.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to a member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) who is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) who is separated from the service or released from active duty for a medical condition affecting the member, as determined by the Secretary concerned;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) who is discharged under section 1173 of title 10; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) who is involuntarily separated from active duty during the period beginning on October 1, 1990, and ending on September 30, 2001.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The allowances authorized under this subsection may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this section, the term &ldquo;involuntarily separated&rdquo; has the meaning given that term in section 1141 of title 10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in connection with a change of temporary or permanent station, a member is entitled to transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking) of baggage and household effects within the weight allowances listed in subparagraph (C), without regard to the comparative costs of the various modes of transportation. Temporary storage in excess of 180 days may be authorized. Alternatively, the member may be paid reimbursement or a monetary allowance under subparagraph (F).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, in the case of a permanent change of station in which the Secretary concerned has authorized transportation of a motor vehicle under section 2634 of title 10 (except when such transportation is authorized from the old duty station to the new duty station), the member is entitled to a monetary allowance for transportation of that motor vehicle&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such monetary allowance shall be established at a rate per mile that does not exceed the rate established under section 404(d)(1) of this title.

<p class="statutory-body">(D) In connection with the change of temporary or permanent station of a member in a pay grade below pay grade O&ndash;6, the Secretary concerned may authorize a higher weight allowance than the weight allowance determined under subparagraph (C) for the member if the Secretary concerned determines that the application of the weight allowance determined under such subparagraph would result in significant hardship to the member or the dependents of the member. An increase in weight allowance under this subparagraph may not result in a weight allowance exceeding the weight allow<!-- PDFPage:120 -->ance specified in subparagraph (C) for pay grades O&ndash;6 to O&ndash;10, unless the additional weight allowance in excess of such maximum is intended to permit the shipping of consumables that cannot be reasonably obtained at the new station of the member. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense, or the Secretary of Transportation for the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, cadets at the United States Military Academy, the United States Air Force Academy, and the United States Coast Guard Academy, and midshipmen at the United States Naval Academy shall be entitled, in connection with temporary or permanent station change, to transportation of baggage and household effects as provided in subparagraph (A). The weight allowance for cadets and midshipmen is 350 pounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) A member entitled to transportation of baggage and household effects under subparagraph (A) may, as an alternative to the provision of transportation, be paid reimbursement or, at the member's request, a monetary allowance in advance for the cost of transportation of the baggage and household effects. The monetary allowance may be paid only if the amount of the allowance does not exceed the cost that would be incurred by the Government under subparagraph (A) for the transportation of the baggage and household effects. Appropriations available to the Department of Defense, the Department of Transportation, and the Department of Health and Human Services for providing transportation of baggage or household effects of members of the uniformed services shall be available to pay a reimbursement or monetary allowance under this subparagraph. The Secretary concerned may prescribe the manner in which the risk of liability for damage, destruction, or loss of baggage or household effects arranged, packed, crated, or loaded by a member is allocated among the member, the United States, and any contractor when a reimbursement or monetary allowance is elected under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The transportation and allowances authorized under paragraph (1) may be paid or provided to a member upon his separation from the service or release from active duty only if the member applies for the transportation and allowances not later than 180 days after the date of his separation or release from active duty. If a member to whom this paragraph applies has been authorized nontemporary storage under subsection (d), the 180-day period shall not begin until such authorization for nontemporary storage expires. This paragraph does not apply to a member to whom subsection (g)(1) applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The allowances and transportation authorized by subsections (a) and (b) are in addition to those authorized by sections 403(c), 404, and 405 of this title and are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) subject to such conditions and limitations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for such grades, ranks, and ratings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to and from such places;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">prescribed by the Secretaries concerned. Transportation of the household effects of a member may not be made by commercial air carrier at an estimated over-all cost that is more than the estimated over-all cost of the transportation thereof by other means, unless an appropriate transportation officer has certified in writing to his commanding officer that those household effects to be so transported are necessary for use in carrying out assigned duties, or are necessary to prevent undue hardship and other means of transportation will not fill those needs. However, not more than 1,000 pounds of unaccompanied baggage may be transported by commercial air carrier, without regard to the preceding sentence, under regulations prescribed under the authority of the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may be authorized in facilities of the United States, or in commercial facilities when it is considered to be more economical to the United States. However, the weight of baggage and household effects stored, plus the weight of the baggage and household effects transported, in connection with a change of station may not be more than the maximum weight limitations in regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned when it is not otherwise fixed by law. In the event a member's baggage and household effects exceed such maximum weight limitation, the Secretary concerned, if requested to do so by the member, may pay the costs for the nontemporary storage of that excess weight and collect the amount paid from the member's pay and allowances, or collect the amount in such other manner as the Secretary concerned determines appropriate. The nontemporary storage of baggage and household effects may not be authorized for a period longer than one year from the date the member concerned is separated from the service, retired, placed on the temporary disability retired list, discharged, or released from active duty, except as prescribed in regulations by the Secretaries concerned for a member who, on that date, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment; or in the case of a member who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except in the case of a member who, on the date of his separation, discharge, or release, or at any time during the one-year period following that date, is confined in a hospital, or is in its vicinity, undergoing medical treatment, the cost of the storage, for the period that exceeds one year, shall be paid by the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When orders directing a change of permanent station for the member concerned have not been issued, or when they have been issued but cannot be used as authority for the transportation of his dependents, baggage, and household <!-- PDFPage:121 -->effects, the Secretaries concerned may authorize the movement of the dependents, baggage, and household effects and prescribe transportation in kind, reimbursement therefor, or a monetary allowance in place thereof (as the case may be), plus a per diem, as authorized under subsection (a) or (b). This subsection may be used only under unusual or emergency circumstances, including those in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member is performing duty at a place designated by the Secretary concerned as being within a zone from which dependents should be evacuated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) orders which direct the member's travel in connection with temporary duty do not provide for return to the permanent station or do not specify or imply any limit to the period of absence from his permanent station; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the member is serving on permanent duty at a station outside the United States, in Hawaii or Alaska, or on sea duty.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, transportation for dependents, baggage, and household effects of a member, plus a per diem for the member's dependents, is authorized if he dies while entitled to basic pay under chapter 3 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Under uniform regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, a member who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is retired, or is placed on the temporary disability retired list, under chapter 61 of title 10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is retired with pay under any other law, or, immediately following at least eight years of continuous active duty with no single break therein of more than 90 days, is discharged with separation pay or severance pay or is involuntarily released from active duty with separation pay or readjustment pay; or</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section,&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.
