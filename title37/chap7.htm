<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining whether a member meets the eligibility criteria under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall take into consideration the amount of the basic allowance for housing that the member receives under section 403 of this title or would otherwise receive under such section, in the case of a member who is not entitled to that allowance as a result of assignment to quarters of the United States or a housing facility under the jurisdiction of a uniformed service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining whether a member meets the eligibility criteria under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned shall not take into consideration&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of the supplemental subsistence allowance that is payable under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount of any special pay that is payable to the member under section 310 of this title, relating to duty subject to hostile fire or imminent danger; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the amount of any family separation allowance that is payable to the member under section 427 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Application for Allowance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;To request the supplemental subsistence allowance, a member shall submit an application to the Secretary concerned in such form and containing such information as the Secretary concerned may prescribe. A member applying for the supplemental subsistence allowance shall furnish such evidence regarding the member's satisfaction of the eligibility criteria under subsection (b) as the Secretary concerned may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Effective Period</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The entitlement of a member to receive the supplemental subsistence allowance terminates upon the occurrence of any of the following events, even though the member continues to meet the eligibility criteria described in subsection (b):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Payment of the supplemental subsistence allowance for 12 consecutive months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Promotion of the member to a higher grade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Transfer of the member in a permanent change of station.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) <cap-smallcap>General Entitlement</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Except as otherwise provided by law, a member of a uniformed service who is entitled to basic pay is entitled to a basic allowance for housing at the monthly rates prescribed under this section or another provision of law with regard to the applicable component of the basic allowance for housing. The amount of the basic allowance for housing for a member will vary according to the pay grade in which the member is assigned or distributed for basic pay purposes, the dependency status of the member, and the geographic location of the member. The basic allowance for housing may be paid in advance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a uniformed service with dependents is not entitled to a basic allowance for housing as a member with dependents unless the member makes a certification to the Secretary concerned indicating the status of each dependent of the member. The certification shall be made in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing Inside the United States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe the rates of the basic allowance for housing that are applicable for the various military housing areas in the United States. The rates for an area shall be based on the costs of adequate housing determined for the area under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense shall determine the costs of adequate housing in a military housing area in the United States for all members of the uniformed services entitled to a basic allowance for housing in that area. The Secretary shall base the determination upon the costs of adequate housing for civilians with comparable income levels in the same area. After June 30, 2001, the Secretary may not differentiate between members with dependents in pay grades E&ndash;1 through E&ndash;4 in determining what constitutes adequate housing for members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The total amount that may be paid for a fiscal year for the basic allowance for housing under this subsection may not be less than the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount authorized to be paid for such allowance for the preceding fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the index of the national average monthly cost of housing for June of the preceding fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the index of the national average monthly cost of housing for June of the second preceding fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An adjustment in the rates of the basic allowance for housing under this subsection as a result of the Secretary's redetermination of housing costs in an area shall take effect on the same date as the effective date of the next increase in basic pay under section 1009 of this title or other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) On and after July 1, 2001, the Secretary of Defense shall establish a single monthly rate for members of the uniformed services with dependents in pay grades E&ndash;1 through E&ndash;4 in the same military housing area. The rate shall be consistent with the rates paid to members in pay grades other than pay grades E&ndash;1 through E&ndash;4 and shall be based on the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The average cost of a two-bedroom apartment in that military housing area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) One-half of the difference between the average cost of a two-bedroom townhouse in that area and the amount determined in subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing within an area of the United States, the monthly amount of the allowance for the member may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Under the authority of this paragraph, the Secretary of Defense may prescribe a temporary increase in the rates of basic allowance for housing otherwise prescribed for a military housing area or a portion of a military housing area if the military housing area or portion thereof&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is located in an area covered by a declaration by the President under section 401 of the <!-- PDFPage:144 -->Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5170) that a major disaster exists; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) contains one or more military installations that are experiencing a sudden increase in the number of members of the armed forces assigned to the installation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary of Defense shall base the amount of the increase to be made in the rates of basic allowance for housing for an area on a determination by the Secretary of the amount by which the costs of adequate housing for civilians have increased in the area by reason of the disaster or the influx of military personnel, except that the increase may not exceed the amount equal to 20 percent of the rate of basic allowance for housing otherwise prescribed for the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A member may be paid a basic allowance for housing at a rate increased under this paragraph only if the member certifies to the Secretary concerned that the member has incurred increased housing costs in the area by reason of the disaster or the influx of military personnel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subject to subparagraph (E), an increase in the rates of basic allowance for housing in an area under this paragraph shall remain in effect until the effective date of the first adjustment in rates of basic allowance for housing made for the area pursuant to a redetermination of housing costs in the area under this subsection that occurs after the date of the increase under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) An increase in the rates of basic allowance for housing for an area may not be prescribed under this paragraph or continue after December 31, 2012.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing Outside the United States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary of Defense may prescribe an overseas basic allowance for housing for a member of a uniformed service who is on duty outside of the United States. The Secretary shall establish the basic allowance for housing under this subsection on the basis of housing costs in the overseas area in which the member is assigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) So long as a member of a uniformed service retains uninterrupted eligibility to receive a basic allowance for housing in an overseas area and the actual monthly cost of housing for the member is not reduced, the monthly amount of the allowance in an area outside the United States may not be reduced as a result of changes in housing costs in the area or the promotion of the member. The monthly amount of the allowance may be adjusted to reflect changes in currency rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a member of the uniformed services authorized to receive an allowance under paragraph (1), the Secretary concerned may make a lump-sum payment to the member for required deposits and advance rent, and for expenses relating thereto, that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) incurred by the member in occupying private housing outside of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) authorized or approved under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Expenses for which a member may be reimbursed under this paragraph may include losses relating to housing that are sustained by the member as a result of fluctuations in the relative value of the currencies of the United States and the foreign country in which the housing is located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary concerned shall recoup the full amount of any deposit or advance rent payments made by the Secretary under subparagraph (A), including any gain resulting from currency fluctuations between the time of payment and the time of recoupment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Basic Allowance for Housing When Dependents Do Not Accompany Member</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A member of a uniformed service with dependents who is on permanent duty at a location described in paragraph (2) may be paid a family separation basic allowance for housing under this subsection at a monthly rate equal to the rate of the basic allowance for housing established under subsection (b) or the overseas basic allowance for housing established under subsection (c), whichever applies to that location, for members in the same grade at that location without dependents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A permanent duty location referred to in paragraph (1) is a location&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to which the movement of the member's dependents is not authorized at the expense of the United States under section 476 of this title, and the member's dependents do not reside at or near the location; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at which quarters of the United States are not available for assignment to the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a member with dependents is assigned to duty in an area that is different from the area in which the member's dependents reside, the member is entitled to a basic allowance for housing as provided in subsection (b) or (c), whichever applies to the member, subject to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If the member's assignment to duty in that area, or the circumstances of that assignment, require the member's dependents to reside in a different area, as determined by the Secretary concerned, the amount of the basic allowance for housing for the member shall be based on the area in which the dependents reside or the member's last duty station, whichever the Secretary concerned determines to be most equitable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the member's assignment to duty in that area is under the conditions of a low-cost or no-cost permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment, the amount of the basic allowance for housing for the member shall be based on the member's last duty station if the Secretary concerned determines that it would be inequitable to base the allowance on the cost of housing in the area to which the member is reassigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If the member is reassigned for a permanent change of station or permanent change of assignment from a duty station in the United States to another duty station in the United States for a period of not more than one year for the purpose of participating in professional military education or training classes, the amount of the basic allowance for housing for <!-- PDFPage:145 -->the member may be based on whichever of the following areas the Secretary concerned determines will provide the more equitable basis for the allowance:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The area of the duty station to which the member is reassigned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The area in which the dependents reside, but only if the dependents reside in that area when the member departs for the duty station to which the member is reassigned and only for the period during which the dependents reside in that area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The area of the former duty station of the member, if different than the area in which the dependents reside.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the rate of the basic allowance for quarters (with dependents) for the member's pay grade, as such rate was in effect on December 31, 1997, under this section (as in effect on that date); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the rate of the basic allowance for quarters (without dependents) for the member's pay grade, as such rate was in effect on December 31, 1997, under this section (as in effect on that date).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever the rates of basic pay for members of the uniformed services are increased, the monthly amount of the basic allowance for housing differential computed under paragraph (3) shall be increased by the average percentage increase in the rates of basic pay. The effective date of the increase shall be the same date as the effective date of the increase in the rates of basic pay.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it would be inequitable for the member's eligibility for the allowance to be determined on the basis of the duty location of the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the other administering Secretaries, shall establish the threshold percentage, except that the threshold percentage may not be less than 8 percent. The administering Secretaries shall prescribe a higher threshold percentage to be applied for a fiscal year when it is necessary to do so in order to ensure that the total amount of the payments of the cost-of-living allowance made to members of the uniformed services under this section for such fiscal year does not exceed the total amount available to all uniformed services for that fiscal year for paying such allowance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the threshold percentage applicable to such fiscal year under subsection (c).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitation to One Allowance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If primary dependents of a member reside separately in different high cost areas&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the member may be paid only one cost-of-living allowance under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the cost-of-living allowance payable to the member shall be the highest of the amounts computed under this section for such high cost areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Service Not Covered</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) A cost-of-living allowance may not be paid a member under this section for the days authorized for travel of the member in connection with a permanent change of duty station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member of a reserve component is not eligible for a cost-of-living allowance under this section unless the member is on active duty under a call or order to active duty that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specifies a period of 140 days or more; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) states that the call or order to active duty is in support of a contingency operation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g) <cap-smallcap>Average Spendable Income</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense shall determine, using a methodology and assumptions that the Secretary considers appropriate, the amounts of average spendable income of members of the uniformed services for various ranges of regular military compensation. For purposes of this subsection, spendable income is the total amount of regular military compensation that is available for purchase of goods and services after allocation of amounts for taxes, insurance, housing, gifts and contributions, and savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Joint Regulations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Defense and the other administering Secretaries shall jointly prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Other Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;primary dependent&rdquo;, with respect to a member, means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the member's spouse; or</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Subject to subsections (b) and (c) of this section,&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;of an armed force&rdquo; are inserted, since the source section, as originally enacted, did not apply to the Public Health Service or the Coast and Geodetic Survey. (See section 243 of the Armed Forces Reserve Act of 1952 (66 Stat. 492).) The words &ldquo;of the Army, or the Air Force, without specification of component&rdquo; are inserted to reflect the definition of &ldquo;reserve component&rdquo; in section 102(k) of the source statute. That definition is executed throughout this revised title. For that reason, the words &ldquo;but not as a member of the Army without specification of component or the Air Force without specification of component, in section 255(a)(2) of existing title 37&rdquo;, are omitted, and since those categories are excluded by the words &ldquo;member of a reserve component&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;of a reserve component&rdquo;, in section 255(a)(3) of existing title 37, are omitted, since the Ready Reserve cannot be in anything other than a reserve component.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;heretofore or hereafter&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c), the words &ldquo;An officer&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;any individual&rdquo;, since the revised section applies only to officers.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (d), the words &ldquo;who is in pay grade O&ndash;1, O&ndash;2, or O&ndash;3&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;is receiving the pay of the junior assistant, assistant, or senior assistant grade&rdquo; to reflect current terminology. (See chapter 3 of this revised title.) The last sentence is substituted for section 214 (words following semicolon) of title 14.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;as a temporary officer&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;5596 or&rdquo; are substituted for section 302(f) of the Act of August 7, 1947, cited above.</p>
