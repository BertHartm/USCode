<p class="statutory-body">(a) When a member of a uniformed service entitled to pay and allowances under section 552 of this title has been in a missing status, and the official report of his death or of the circumstances of his absence has not been received by the Secretary concerned, he shall, before the end of a 12-month period in that status, have the case fully reviewed. After that review and the end of the 12-month period in a missing status, or after a later review which shall be made when warranted by information received or other circumstances, the Secretary concerned, or his designee, may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the member can reasonably be presumed to be living, direct a continuance of his missing status; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make a finding of death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a finding of death is made under subsection (a), it shall include the date death is presumed to have occurred for the purpose of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ending the crediting of pay and allowances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) settlement of accounts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) payment of death gratuities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">That date is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the day after the day on which the 12-month period in a missing status ends; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the missing status has been continued under subsection (a), the day determined by the Secretary concerned, or his designee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) For the sole purpose of determining status under this section, a dependent of a member on active duty is treated as if he were a member. Any determination made by the Secretary concerned, or his designee, under this section is conclusive on all other departments and agencies of the United States. This subsection does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.</p>
