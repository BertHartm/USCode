<p class="statutory-body">(2) After the deduction of pay forfeited by the sentence of a court-martial, if any, or otherwise authorized by law to be withheld, the deductions authorized by this section may not reduce the pay actually received by a member of the uniformed services for any month to less than one-third of the member's pay for that month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If the indebtedness of a member of the uniformed services to the United States is due to the overpayment of pay or allowances to the member through no fault of the member, the amount of the overpayment shall be recovered in monthly installments. The amount deducted from the pay of the member for a month to recover the overpayment amount may not exceed 15 percent of the member's pay for that month unless the member requests or consents to collection of the overpayment at an accelerated rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In all cases described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary concerned shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the member to request a delay in the imposition of the repayment requirement to recover the indebtedness. Before beginning collection efforts, the Secretary concerned shall consider the reasons provided by the member for the requested delay, including the financial ability of the member to repay the indebtedness, and the hardship that immediate collection would impose on the member and the member's dependents.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:240 --><p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If a member of the uniformed services, through no fault of the member, incurs a wound, injury, or illness while in the line of duty in a combat operation or combat zone designated by the President or the Secretary of Defense, any overpayment of pay or allowances made to the member while the member recovers from the wound, injury, or illness may not be deducted from the member's pay until&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) Subject to subsection (c), an amount due the United States from an enlisted member of the Army or the Air Force may be deducted from his pay on final statement, or from his savings on his clothing allowance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The amount of any damage, or cost of repairs, to arms or equipment caused by the abuse or negligence of a member of the Army, Navy, Air Force, or Marine Corps, as the case may be, who had the care of, or was using, the property when it was damaged, shall be deducted from his pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) If, upon final settlement of the accounts of an officer of the Army or the Air Force charged with the issue of an article of military supply, there is a deficiency of that article, or if an article of military supply with whose issue an officer is charged is damaged, the value of the lost article or the amount of the damage shall be charged against the officer and deducted from his monthly pay, unless he shows to the satisfaction of the Secretary of the Army or the Secretary of the Air Force, as the case may be, by one or more affidavits setting forth the circumstances, that he was not at fault.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) An amount due the United States from an officer of the Army or the Air Force for rations bought on credit, and for articles bought on credit under section 4621(a)(1) or 9621(a)(1) of title 10, shall be deducted from the next pay due that officer after the sale is reported.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Upon request by a service relief society and subject to paragraph (2), an amount owed by a member of the uniformed services to the relief society may be deducted from the pay on final statement of such member and paid to that relief society.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An amount may not be deducted under paragraph (1) from the pay of a member unless the Secretary concerned makes a determination of the amount owed in accordance with the regulations prescribed under subsection (c). Any amount determined to be owed to a service relief society under this paragraph shall be considered an amount that the member is administratively determined to owe the United States under subsection (c) and shall be collectible in accordance with such subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretaries concerned shall prescribe regulations to carry out this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;service relief society&rdquo; means the Army Emergency Relief, the Air Force Aid Society, the Navy Relief Society, or the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) There shall be deducted each month from the pay of each enlisted member, warrant officer, and limited duty officer of the armed forces on active duty an amount (determined under paragraph (3)) not to exceed $1.00.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts deducted under paragraph (1) shall be deposited in the Armed Forces Retirement Home Trust Fund.</p>
