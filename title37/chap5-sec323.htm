<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Transportation with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, shall notify Congress, in advance, of each military skill to be designated by the Secretary as critical for purposes of this section. The notice shall be submitted at least 90 days before any bonus with regard to that critical skill is offered under subsection (a) and shall include a discussion of the necessity for the bonus, the amount and method of payment of the bonus, and the retention results that the bonus is expected to achieve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Payment Methods</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A bonus under this section may be paid in a single lump sum or in periodic installments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Maximum Bonus Amount</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A member may enter into an agreement under this section, or reenlist or voluntarily extend the member's enlistment, more than once to receive a bonus under this section.
