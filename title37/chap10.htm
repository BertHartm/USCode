<p class="statutory-body">(a) In this section, &ldquo;household and personal effects&rdquo; and &ldquo;household effects&rdquo; may include, in addition to other authorized weight allowances, one privately owned motor vehicle which may be shipped at United States expense. Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, and in place of the transportation of household and personal effects, a dependent, who would otherwise be entitled to transportation of household and personal effects under this section, may transport a house trailer or mobile dwelling within and between the areas specified in section 409 of this title for use as a residence by one of the following means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) transport it and be reimbursed by the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) deliver it to an agent of the United States for transportation by the United States or by commercial means; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) have it transported by commercial means, and be reimbursed by the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If a trailer or dwelling is transported under clause (2) or (3), that transportation may include one privately owned motor vehicle which may be shipped at United States expense. Transportation, and incidental costs, authorized by this section shall be at United States expense without any cost limitation, and any payment authorized may be made in advance of the transportation concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking of household and personal effects) may be provided for the dependents and household and personal effects of a member of a uniformed service on active duty (without regard to pay grade) who is officially reported as dead, injured, ill, or absent for a period of more than 29 days in a missing status&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to the member's official residence of record;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the residence of his dependent, next of kin, or other person entitled to custody of the effects, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) on request of the member (if injured or ill), or his dependent, next of kin, or other person described in clause (2), to another location determined in advance or later approved by the Secretary concerned, or his designee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">When he considers it necessary, the Secretary concerned may, with respect to the household and personal effects of a member who is officially reported as absent for a period of more than 29 days in a missing status, authorize the nontemporary storage of those effects for a period of one year, or longer when justified. In addition, he may authorize additional movements of, and prescribe transportation for, the dependents and household and personal effects, or the dependents and house trailer or mobile dwelling, of a member who is officially reported as absent for a period of more than one year in a missing status.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When a member described in subsection (b) is in an injured or ill status, transportation of dependents and household and personal effects authorized by this section may be provided only when prolonged hospitalization or treatment is anticipated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Transportation requested by a dependent may be authorized under this section only if there is a reasonable relationship between the circumstances of the dependent and the requested destination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In place of the transportation for dependents authorized by this section, and after the travel is completed, the Secretary concerned may authorize&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reimbursement for the commercial cost of the transportation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a monetary allowance at the prescribed rate for all, or that part, of the travel for which transportation in kind is not furnished.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Secretary concerned may store the household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b) until proper disposition can be made. The cost of the storage and transportation (including packing, crating, drayage, temporary storage, and unpacking) of household and personal effects shall be charged against appropriations currently available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary concerned may, when he determines that there is an emergency and a sale would be in the best interests of the United States, provide for the public or private sale of motor vehicles and other bulky items of household and personal effects of a member described in subsection (b). Before a sale, and if practicable, a reasonable effort shall be made to determine the desires of the interested persons. The net proceeds received from the sale shall, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary concerned, be sent to the owner or other persons. If there are no such persons, or if they or their addresses are not known within one year from the date of sale, the net proceeds may be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Claims for net proceeds that are covered into the Treasury under subsection (g) may be filed with the Secretary of Defense by the rightful owners, their heirs or next of kin, or their legal representatives at any time before the end of a 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury. When a claim is filed, the Secretary of Defense shall allow or disallow it. A claim that is allowed shall be paid from the appropriation for refunding money erroneously received and covered. If a claim is not filed before the end of the 5-year period from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury, it is barred from being acted on by the courts or the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under this section does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the dependent for expenses incurred after that <!-- PDFPage:160 -->date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use. The amount reimbursed may not exceed $30 per day, and the rental period for which reimbursement may be provided expires after 7 days or on the date on which the delayed vehicle arrives at the authorized destination (whichever occurs first).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) This section does not amend or repeal&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 2575, 2733, 4712, 6522, or 9712 of title 10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 507 of title 14; or</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may make any determination necessary to administer this chapter and, when so made, it is conclusive as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) death or finding of death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the fact of dependency under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the fact of dependency for the purpose of paying six months&rsquo; death gratuities authorized by law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the fact of dependency under any other law authorizing the payment of pay, allowances, or other emoluments to enlisted members of the armed forces, when the payments are contingent on dependency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) any other status covered by this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) an essential date, including one on which evidence or information is received by the Secretary concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) whether information received concerning a member of a uniformed service is to be construed and acted on as an official report of death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraphs (1), (5), (6), and (7) only apply with respect to a case to which section 555 of this title applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the Secretary concerned, in a case to which section 555 of this title applies, receives information that he considers establishes conclusively the death of a member of a uniformed service, he shall, notwithstanding any earlier action relating to death or other status of the member, act on it as an official report of death. After the end of the 12-month period in a missing status prescribed by section 555 of this title, the Secretary concerned, or his designee, shall, when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that a member in a missing status is dead, make a finding of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may determine the entitlement of a member to pay and allowances under this chapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive. An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that a member captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may, when warranted by the circumstances, reconsider a determination made under this chapter, and change or modify it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the account of a member has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this chapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the member if the Secretary concerned, or his designee, determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the member was not a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from pay and allowances of a member for the period he is entitled to pay and allowances under section 552 of this title may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when it was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death. An allotment payment for a period after the end of entitlement to pay and allowances under this chapter, or otherwise, which was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death, may not be collected from the allottee or charged against the pay of the deceased member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The Secretary concerned, or his designee, may waive the recovery of an erroneous payment or overpayment of an allotment to a dependent if he considers recovery is against equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) For the sole purpose of determining pay under this section, a dependent of a member of a uniformed service on active duty is treated as if he were a member. Any determination made by the Secretary concerned, or his designee, under this section in a case to which section 555 of this title applies is conclusive on all other departments and agencies of the United States. This subsection does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts so allotted shall bear interest at a rate which, for any calendar quarter, shall be equal to the average rate paid on United States Treasury bills with three-month maturities issued during the preceding calendar quarter.
