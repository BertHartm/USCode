<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;on active duty (other than for training)&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;on the active .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. list&rdquo; to conform to longstanding administrative construction, and because there is no &ldquo;active list&rdquo; in the case of many of the uniformed services named, but only for certain regular component of those services, e.g., the &ldquo;Regular Army&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Regular Air Force&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;a retired list of that service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;retired list&rdquo;, since there is more than one retired list for many of the services named. (See sections 1376, 3966, and 8966 of title 10, for example.) The words &ldquo;members of the Reserve components of the respective services entitled to Federal pay either on the active or any retired list of said services&rdquo; are omitted as covered by clause (1), since members of the reserve components are members of the uniformed services concerned. The word &ldquo;transferred&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage.</p>
