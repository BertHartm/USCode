<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;within that department&rdquo; are inserted for clarity. The words &ldquo;may prescribe&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;shall prescribe&rdquo;, since the words &ldquo;that he considers necessary&rdquo; indicate that the prescribing of regulations is not mandatory.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is substituted for section 255(d) (less last sentence) of existing title 37. Section 255(d) last sentence) of existing title 37 is omitted, since the categories named therein are excluded by the words &ldquo;a reserve officer&rdquo;.
