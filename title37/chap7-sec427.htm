<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) he is on temporary duty away from his permanent station for a continuous period of more than 30 days and his dependents do not reside at or near his temporary duty station.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A member who becomes entitled to an allowance under this subsection by virtue of duty prescribed in subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (1) for a continuous period of more than 30 days is entitled to the allowance effective as of the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the first day of that period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day the member ceased being entitled to a previous allowance under this subsection by reason of the end of duty prescribed in such subparagraphs, if the member ceased being entitled to the previous allowance within 30 days before the first day of that period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Entitlement When No Residence or Household Maintained for Dependents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An allowance is payable under subsection (a) even though the member does not maintain for his primary dependents who would otherwise normally reside with him, a residence or household, subject to his management and control, which he is likely to share with them as a common household when his duty assignment permits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) <cap-smallcap>Effect of Election to Serve Unaccompanied Tour of Duty</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A member who elects to serve a tour of duty unaccompanied by his dependents at a permanent station to which the movement of his dependents is authorized at the expense of the United States under section 406 of this title is not entitled to an allowance under subsection (a)(1)(A). The Secretary concerned may waive the preceding sentence in situations in which it would be inequitable to deny the allowance to the member because of unusual family or operational circumstances.</p>
