<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, when dependents of members of the uniformed services are authorized or ordered to depart by competent authority, they may be authorized such allowances as the Secretary concerned determines necessary to offset the expenses incident to the departure. Allowances authorized by this section are in addition to those authorized by any other section of this title. Such allowances may be paid in advance. For the purposes of this section, a dependent &ldquo;authorized or ordered to depart by competent authority&rdquo; includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a dependent who is present at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station when the departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority and who actually moved to an authorized safe haven designated by that authority, whether such safe haven is at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station or elsewhere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a dependent who resides at or in the vicinity of a former duty station of the member following the assignment of the member elsewhere or who resides at or in the vicinity of a duty station (other than the duty station of the member) incident to orders in connection with an unaccompanied tour of duty of the member, if a departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority from the duty station at which or in the vicinity of which the dependent resides and the dependent actually moves to an authorized safe haven designated by that authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a dependent who established a household at or in the vicinity of the member's duty station but who is temporarily absent therefrom for any reason when departure of dependents is authorized or ordered by competent authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a dependent who was authorized to join the member and who departed from his former place of residence incident to joining the member but who, as a result of the departure of dependents, is diverted to a safe haven designated by competent authority or is authorized to travel to a place the dependent may designate, even though he was in the United States when the departure was authorized or ordered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretaries concerned, each member whose dependents are covered by subsection (a) is entitled to have one motor vehicle that is owned by the member (or a dependent of the member) and is for the personal use of the member or his dependents, transported at the expense of the United States to a designated place for the use of the dependents. When the dependents are permitted to rejoin the member, the vehicle may be transported at the expense of the United States to his permanent duty station.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a motor vehicle of a member (or a dependent of the member) that is transported at the expense of the United States under paragraph (1) does not arrive at the authorized destination of the vehicle by the designated delivery date, the Secretary concerned shall reimburse the member for expenses incurred after that date to rent a motor vehicle for the dependent's use. The amount reimbursed may not exceed $30 per day, and the rental period for which reimbursement may be provided expires after 7 days or on the date on which the delayed vehicle arrives at the authorized destination (whichever occurs first).</p>
