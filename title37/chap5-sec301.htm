<p class="note-body">(g) The term &ldquo;duty involving the servicing of aircraft or missiles with highly toxic fuels or propellants or the testing of aircraft or missile systems (or components of such systems) during which highly toxic fuels or propellants are used&rdquo; shall be construed to mean duty performed by members as a primary duty that requires (1) removal, replacement, and servicing of the emergency power unit of an aircraft with H&ndash;70 propellant (30 percent water, 70 percent hydrazine); (2) participation by those personnel performing duties described in (g)(1) who must also participate in an emergency response force, spill containment, or spill cleanup involving H&ndash;70 propellant (30 percent water, 70 percent hydrazine); (3) handling and maintaining the liquid propellants (liquid oxidizer-nitrogen tetroxide; unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) used in the Titan weapon system, if such duty requires qualification in the use of the Rocket Fuel Handler's Clothing Outfit and involves (A) launch duct operations, including flow, pressurization, on-load, set-up or tear down involving propellant transfer operations; (B) set-up, installation or tear down for fuel/oxidizer flow; (C) decontamination of equipment, including, but not limited to, the Rocket Fuel Handler's Clothing Outfit; (D) venting or pressurizing missile fuel or oxidizer tanks; (E) removing or replacing missile components while missile fuel and oxidizer tanks are loaded with such propellants; (F) transferring propellants between commercial and military holding trailers, or between holding trailers and fuel/oxidizer pump rooms; or normal preventive maintenance activities including, but not limited to, seal changes; (4) handling and maintaining the propellants, unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine and inhibited red-fuming nitric acid, used in the LANCE missile system; (5) handling, transporting or working with toxic fuels/propellants by members assigned to the Air Force Rocket Propulsion Lab (AFRPL) who (A) directly manage and inspect the activities of crew members conducting operations involving experimental rocket propulsion systems and components; (B) directly monitor and set up measurement instruments in operational areas where contamination is suspected or may be physically present; (C) install and remove instrumentation devices from propulsion systems and components; (D) perform final test preparation and immediate safety inspection duties around pressurized, active systems during prerun and postrun test periods; or, (E) install and repair electrical systems; (6) handling, loading/unloading and transporting toxic fuels and oxidizers at the precision sled track while working with the liquid rocket sled, which uses JP&ndash;X (a mixture of jet fuel (JP&ndash;4) and unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine) and red-fuming nitric acid and a propulsion; or (7) involvement with other toxic substances contained in missile or aircraft weapon system fuels or propellants as determined by the Secretary concerned. The entitlement to the pay provided for in this subsection is based upon the performance of such duty which has the potential for accidental or inadvertent exposure to highly toxic fuels or propellants or related substances and not upon actual quantifiable exposure to such substances. Therefore, neither this construction of the term nor the receipt of the pay provided for in this subsection may be construed as indicating that any person entitled to such pay has been actually exposed to highly toxic fuels or propellants or related substances contrary to the provisions of any statute, Executive order, rule, or regulation relating to health or safety which is applicable to the uniformed services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) The term &ldquo;duty involving frequent and regular exposure to highly toxic pesticides&rdquo; shall be construed to <!-- PDFPage:30 -->mean duty performed by members who, while under competent orders assigning such members to the entomology, pest control, pest management, or preventive medicine functions of a uniformed service for a period of 30 consecutive days or more, are required to perform in any calendar month a fumigation task utilizing (1) phosphine, sulfuryl fluoride, hydrogen cyanide, methyl bromide, or (2) a fumigant of comparable high acute toxicity and hazard potential. The use of solid fumigant formulations, such as aluminum phosphide, magnesium phosphide and calcium cyanide, in the outdoor control of burrowing animals does not qualify a member for incentive pay under this subsection.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The term &ldquo;duty involving laboratory work that utilizes live dangerous viruses or bacteria&rdquo; shall be construed to mean primary duty performed by members who work with micro-organisms (1) that cause disease (A) with a high potential for mortality, and (B) for which effective therapeutic procedures are not available, and (2) for which no effective prophylactic immunization exists, while such members are assigned by competent orders for a period of 30 consecutive days or more to participate in or conduct applied or basic research that is characterized by a changing variety of techniques, procedures, equipment, and experiments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(j) The term &ldquo;the handling of chemical munitions (or components of such munitions)&rdquo; shall be construed to mean duty performed by members as a primary duty which routinely requires (1) direct physical handling of toxic chemical munitions incident to storage, maintenance, testing, surveillance, assembly, disassembly, demilitarization, or disposal of said munitions; (2) direct physical handling of chemical surety material, as defined by the Secretary concerned, incident to manufacture, storage, testing, laboratory analysis, detoxification, or disposal of said material; (3) direct physical handling of toxic chemical munitions incident to technical escort of shipments of said munitions; (4) direct physical handling of chemical surety material, as defined by the Secretary concerned incident to technical escort of shipments of said material. The term does not include the handling of the individual components of binary chemical agents or munitions. The term does not include user handling incident to loading, firing, or otherwise launching the toxic chemical munitions nor field storage operations during hostilities. The term also excludes the handling of Research, Development, Testing and Evaluation Dilute Solutions of toxic chemicals as defined by the Secretary concerned. It also excludes the handling of riot control agents, chemical defoliants and herbicides, smoke, flame and incendiaries, and industrial chemicals. The entitlement to the pay provided for in this subsection is based upon the performance of such duty that has the potential for accidental exposure to chemical agents and not upon actual quantifiable exposure to such agents. Therefore, neither the construction of the term nor the receipt of pay provided for in this subsection may be construed as indicating that any person entitled to such pay actually has been exposed to chemical agents contrary to the provisions of any statute, executive order, rule, or regulations relating to the health and safety which is applicable to the uniformed services.</p>
