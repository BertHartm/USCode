<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;National Guard, Air National Guard&rdquo;, in section 301(a) of existing title 37, to conform to the definition of &ldquo;National Guard&rdquo; in section 101(6) of this revised title. The words &ldquo;member of a reserve component of a uniformed service&rdquo; are substituted for the words &ldquo;National Guard of the United States, Air National Guard of the United States, Organized Reserve Corps, Naval Reserve, Air Force Reserve, Marine Corps Reserve, Coast Guard Reserve, and the Reserve Corps of the Public Health Service,&rdquo; since all of those organizations, or their successors, are the reserve components of the uniformed services. The words &ldquo;who is not entitled to basic pay under section 204 of this title&rdquo; are substituted for section 301(e) as (applicable to basic pay) of existing title 37. The words &ldquo;of a corresponding grade&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;National Guard or reserve components&rdquo; are substituted for the listing of organizations for the reasons set forth above. Reference to &ldquo;classes of organization,&rdquo; so far as they relate to the National Guard, are omitted, since there are no classes of organization of the National Guard.</p>
