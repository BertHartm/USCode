<p class="statutory-body">(d) <cap-smallcap>Refunds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Refunds shall be required, on a pro rata basis, of sums paid under this section if the officer who has received the payment fails to complete the total period of active duty specified in the agreement, as conditions and circumstances warrant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An obligation to reimburse the United States imposed under paragraph (1) is for all purposes a debt owed to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A discharge in bankruptcy under title 11, United States Code, that is entered less than five years after the termination of an agreement under this section does not discharge the member signing such agreement from a debt arising under such agreement or under paragraph (1).
