<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Governing bodies of Indian tribes; amount; non-Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of this part, may make grants to the governing bodies of Indian tribes located on Federal and State reservations (and consortia of such governing bodies) to pay 90 percent of the costs of vocational rehabilitation services for American Indians who are individuals with disabilities residing on such reservations. The non-Federal share of such costs may be in cash or in kind, fairly valued, and the Commissioner may waive such non-Federal share requirement in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application; effective period; continuation of programs and services; separate service delivery systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No grant may be made under this part for any fiscal year unless an application therefor has been submitted to and approved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may not approve an application unless the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is made at such time, in such manner, and contains such information as the Commissioner may require;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contains assurances that the rehabilitation services provided under this part to American Indians who are individuals with disabilities residing on a reservation in a State shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, comparable to rehabilitation services provided under this subchapter to other individuals with disabilities residing in the State and that, where appropriate, may include services traditionally used by Indian tribes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contains assurances that the application was developed in consultation with the designated State unit of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of sections 450c, 450d, 450e, and 450f(a) of title 25 shall be applicable to any application submitted under this part. For purposes of this paragraph, any reference in any such provision to the Secretary of Education or to the Secretary of the Interior shall be considered to be a reference to the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any application approved under this part shall be effective for not less than twelve months or more than 36 months, except as determined otherwise by the Commissioner pursuant to prescribed regulations. The State shall continue to provide vocational rehabilitation services under its State plan to American Indians residing on a reservation whenever such State includes any such American Indians in its State population under section 730(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In making grants under this part, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to applications for the continuation of programs which have been funded under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize a separate service delivery system for Indian residents of a State who reside in non-reservation areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Reservation&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;reservation&rdquo; includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.].</p>
