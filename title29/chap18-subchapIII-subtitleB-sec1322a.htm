<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The succeeding subparagraphs of this paragraph are enacted by the Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of joint resolutions (as defined in subparagraph (B)). Such subparagraphs shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection, &ldquo;joint resolution&rdquo; means only a joint resolution, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &ldquo;The proposed schedule described in &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; transmitted to the Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; is hereby approved.&rdquo;, the first blank space therein being filled with &ldquo;section 4022A(f)(2)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974&rdquo;, &ldquo;section 4022A(f)(2)(A)(iii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974&rdquo;, &ldquo;section 4022A(f)(3)(A)(i) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974&rdquo;, or &ldquo;section 4022A(f)(3)(A)(ii) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974&rdquo; (whichever is applicable), and the second blank space therein being filled with the date on which the corporation's message proposing the revision was submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The procedure for disposition of a joint resolution shall be the procedure described in section 1306(b)(4) through (7) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may guarantee the payment of such other classes of benefits under multiemployer plans, and establish the terms and conditions under which those other classes of benefits are guaranteed, as it determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The corporation shall prescribe regulations to establish a supplemental program to guarantee benefits under multiemployer plans which would be guaranteed under this section but for the limitations in subsection (c) of this section. Such regulations shall be proposed by the corporation no later than the end of the 18th calendar month following September 26, 1980. The regulations shall make coverage under the supplemental program available no later than January 1, 1983.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) such other reasonable terms and conditions for supplemental coverage, including funding standards and any other reasonable limitations with respect to plans or benefits covered or to means of program financing, as the corporation determines are necessary and appropriate for a feasible supplemental program consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No revised schedule of premiums under this subsection, after the initial schedule, shall go into effect unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the revised schedule is submitted to the Congress, and</p>
