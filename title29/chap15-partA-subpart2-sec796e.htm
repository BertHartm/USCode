<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Population basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), from sums appropriated for each fiscal year to carry out this subpart, the Commissioner shall make an allotment to each State whose State plan has been approved under section 796d&ndash;1 of this title of an amount bearing the same ratio to such sums as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Maintenance of 1992 amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, the amount of any allotment made under subparagraph (A) to a State for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of an allotment made to the State for fiscal year 1992 under part A of this subchapter, as in effect on the day before October 29, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Minimums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, and except as provided in subparagraph (B), the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $275,000 or one-third of one percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $275,000 or one-third of one percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain territories</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustment for inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1994, in which the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Commissioner shall increase the minimum allotment under paragraph (1)(C) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:306 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by such State in carrying out the provisions of this subpart, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the provisions of this subpart to one or more of the States that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
