Pursuant to such procedure, he may grant a conditional or unconditional exemption of any fiduciary or transaction, or class of fiduciaries or transactions, from all or part of the restrictions imposed by sections 1106 and 1107(a) of this title. Action under this subsection may be taken only after consultation and coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury. An exemption granted under this section shall not relieve a fiduciary from any other applicable provision of this chapter. The Secretary may not grant an exemption under this subsection unless he finds that such exemption is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) administratively feasible,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before granting an exemption under this subsection from section 1106(a) or 1107(a) of this title, the Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the exemption, shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and shall afford interested persons opportunity to present views.

A loan made by a plan shall not fail to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence by reason of a loan repayment suspension described under section 414(u)(4) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Contracting or making reasonable arrangements with a party in interest for office space, or legal, accounting, or other services necessary for the establishment or operation of the plan, if no more than reasonable compensation is paid therefor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such loan is primarily for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries of the plan, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the plan gives collateral to a party in interest for such loan, such collateral may consist only of qualifying employer securities (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The investment of all or part of a plan's assets in deposits which bear a reasonable interest rate in a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan covers only employees of such bank or other institution and employees of affiliates of such bank or other institution, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such investment is expressly authorized by a provision of the plan or by a fiduciary (other than such bank or institution or affiliate thereof) who is expressly empowered by the plan to so instruct the trustee with respect to such investment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Any contract for life insurance, health insurance, or annuities with one or more insurers which are qualified to do business in a State, if the plan pays no more than adequate consideration, and if each such insurer or insurers is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a party in interest which is wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the employer maintaining the plan, or by any person which is a party in interest with respect to the plan, but only if the total premiums and annuity considerations written by such insurers for life insurance, health insurance, or annuities for all plans (and their employers) with respect to which such insurers are parties in interest (not including premiums or annuity considerations written by the employer maintaining the plan) do not exceed 5 percent of the total premiums and annuity considerations written for all lines of insurance in that year by such insurers (not including premiums or annuity considerations written by the employer maintaining the plan).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:414 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The providing of any ancillary service by a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan, and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such bank or similar financial institution has adopted adequate internal safeguards which assure that the providing of such ancillary service is consistent with sound banking and financial practice, as determined by Federal or State supervisory authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which such ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by such bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Secretary after consultation with Federal and State supervisory authority), and adherence to such guidelines would reasonably preclude such bank or similar financial institution from providing such ancillary service (i) in an excessive or unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such ancillary services shall not be provided at more than reasonable compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The exercise of a privilege to convert securities, to the extent provided in regulations of the Secretary, but only if the plan receives no less than adequate consideration pursuant to such conversion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the transaction is a sale or purchase of an interest in the fund,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the bank, trust company, or insurance company receives not more than reasonable compensation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such transaction is expressly permitted by the instrument under which the plan is maintained, or by a fiduciary (other than the bank, trust company, or insurance company, or an affiliate thereof) who has authority to manage and control the assets of the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The making by a fiduciary of a distribution of the assets of the plan in accordance with the terms of the plan if such assets are distributed in the same manner as provided under section 1344 of this title (relating to allocation of assets).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Any transaction required or permitted under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) A merger of multiemployer plans, or the transfer of assets or liabilities between multiemployer plans, determined by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to meet the requirements of section 1411 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The sale by a plan to a party in interest on or after December 18, 1987, of any stock, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (e) of this section are met with respect to such stock,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the later of the date on which the stock was acquired by the plan, or January 1, 1975, such stock constituted a qualifying employer security (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title as then in effect), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such stock does not constitute a qualifying employer security (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title as in effect at the time of the sale).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Any transfer made before January 1, 2006, of excess pension assets from a defined benefit plan to a retiree health account in a qualified transfer permitted under section 420 of title 26 (as in effect on December 17, 1999).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) receiving any reasonable compensation for services rendered, or for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred, in the performance of his duties with the plan; except that no person so serving who already receives full time pay from an employer or an association of employers, whose employees are participants in the plan, or from an employee organization whose members are participants in such plan shall receive compensation from such plan, except for reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred; or</p>
