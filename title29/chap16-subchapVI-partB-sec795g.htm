<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the grant recipient provides any direct financial benefit to the reviewer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) participation in the review would give the appearance of a conflict of interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In making a determination concerning any subsequent grant under this section, the Commissioner shall consider the past performance of the applicant, if applicable. The Commissioner shall use compliance indicators developed under this subsection that are consistent with program evaluation standards developed under subsection (d) of this section to assess minimum project performance for purposes of making continuation awards in the third, fourth, and fifth years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each fiscal year the Commissioner shall include in the annual report to Congress required by section 712 of this title an analysis of the extent to which grant recipients have complied with the evaluation standards.
