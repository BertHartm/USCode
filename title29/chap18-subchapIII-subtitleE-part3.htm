<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of overburden credit to determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the minimum contribution requirement under section 1423 of this title (before the application of section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title) the plan sponsor of a plan which is overburdened for the plan year shall apply an overburden credit against the plan's minimum contribution requirement for the plan year (determined without regard to section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title and without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of overburden status of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants under the plan in the base plan year exceeds the average of the number of active participants in the base plan year and the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of employer contributions under the plan equals or exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such rate for the preceding plan year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such rate for the plan year preceding the first year in which the plan is in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of overburden credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) one-half of the average guaranteed benefit paid for the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the overburden factor for the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year shall not exceed the amount of the minimum contribution requirement for such year (determined without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of overburden factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the overburden factor of a plan for the plan year is an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants for the base plan year, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average of the number of active participants for the base plan year and for each of the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions; determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;pay status participant&rdquo; means, with respect to a plan, a participant receiving retirement benefits under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The number of active participants for a plan year shall be the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of active employees who are participants in the plan and on whose behalf contributions are required to be made during the plan year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of active employees who are not participants in the plan but who are in an employment unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement which requires the employees&rsquo; employer to contribute to the plan, unless service in such employment unit was never covered under the plan or a predecessor thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total number of active employees attributed to employers who made payments to the plan for the plan year of withdrawal liability pursuant to part 1 of this subtitle, determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total amount of such payments, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount equal to the total contributions received by the plan during the plan year divided by the average number of active employees who were participants in the plan during the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulation provide alternative methods of determining active participants where (by reason of irregular employment, contributions on a unit basis, or otherwise) this paragraph does not yield a representative basis for determining the credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;average number&rdquo; means, with respect to pay status participants for a plan year, a number equal to one-half the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number with respect to the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number with respect to the plan as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The average guaranteed benefit paid is 12 times the average monthly pension payment guaranteed under section 1322a(c)(1) of this title determined under the provisions of the plan in effect at the beginning of the first plan year in which the plan is in reorganization and without regard to section 1322a(c)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1424_1_target" name="1424_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The first year in which the plan is in reorganization is the first of a period of 1 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan has been in reorganization not taking into account any plan years the plan was in reorganization prior to any period of 3 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan was not in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Eligibility of plan for overburden credit for plan year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a plan is not eligible for an overburden credit for a plan year if the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the plan's current contribution base for the plan year was reduced, without a corresponding reduction in the plan's unfunded vested benefits attributable to pay status participants, as a result of a change in an agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (within the meaning of part 1 of this subtitle) does not impair a plan's eligibility for an overburden credit, unless the Secretary of the Treasury finds that a contribution base reduction described in paragraph (1) resulted from a transfer of liabilities to another plan in connection with the withdrawal.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:603 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Overburden credit where 2 or more multiemployer plans merge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if 2 or more multiemployer plans merge, the amount of the overburden credit which may be applied under this section with respect to the plan resulting from the merger for any of the 3 plan years ending after the effective date of the merger shall not exceed the sum of the used overburden credit for each of the merging plans for its last plan year ending before the effective date of the merger. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the used overburden credit is that portion of the credit which does not exceed the excess of the minimum contribution requirement (determined without regard to any overburden requirement under this section) over the employer contributions required under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amendment of multiemployer plan in reorganization to reduce or eliminate accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions ineligible for guarantee of corporation; adjustment of vested benefits charge to reflect plan amendment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, a multiemployer plan in reorganization may be amended in accordance with this section, to reduce or eliminate accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions which, under section 1322a(b) of this title, are not eligible for the corporation's guarantee. The preceding sentence shall only apply to accrued benefits under plan amendments (or plans) adopted after March 26, 1980, or under collective bargaining agreements entered into after March 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the minimum contribution requirement with respect to a plan for a plan year under section 1423(b) of this title, the vested benefits charge may be adjusted to reflect a plan amendment reducing benefits under this section or section 412(c)(8)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1425_1_target" name="1425_1">1</a></sup> of title 26, but only if the amendment is adopted and effective no later than 2&frac12; months after the end of the plan year, or within such extended period as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation under section 412(c)(10)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1425_1_target" name="1425_1">1</a></sup> of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reduction of accrued benefits; notice by plan sponsors to plan participants and beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Accrued benefits may not be reduced under this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notice has been given, at least 6 months before the first day of the plan year in which the amendment reducing benefits is adopted, to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any category of accrued benefits is not reduced with respect to inactive participants to a greater extent proportionally than such category of accrued benefits is reduced with respect to active participants,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) benefits attributable to employer contributions other than accrued benefits and the rate of future benefit accruals are reduced at least to an extent equal to the reduction in accrued benefits of inactive participants, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the rate of employer contributions, calculated without regard to the amendment, for the plan year in which the amendment becomes effective, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the rate of employer contributions for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the amendment becomes effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan sponsors shall include in any notice required to be sent to plan participants and beneficiaries under paragraph (1) information as to the rights and remedies of plan participants and beneficiaries as well as how to contact the Department of Labor for further information and assistance where appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recoupment by plan of excess benefit payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan may not recoup a benefit payment which is in excess of the amount payable under the plan because of an amendment retroactively reducing accrued benefits under this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:604 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amendment of plan to increase or restore accrued benefits previously reduced or rate of future benefit accruals; conditions, applicable factors, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A plan which has been amended to reduce accrued benefits under this section may be amended to increase or restore accrued benefits, or the rate of future benefit accruals, only if the plan is amended to restore levels of previously reduced accrued benefits of inactive participants and of participants who are within 5 years of attaining normal retirement age to at least the same extent as any such increase in accrued benefits or in the rate of future benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection, in the case of a plan which has been amended under this section to reduce accrued benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit increase to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit restoration to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is not thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan immediately before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a plan is amended to partially restore previously reduced accrued benefit levels, or the rate of future benefit accruals, the benefits of inactive participants shall be restored in at least the same proportions as other accrued benefits which are restored.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No benefit increase under a plan may take effect in a plan year in which an amendment reducing accrued benefits under the plan, in accordance with this section, is adopted or first becomes effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A plan is not required to make retroactive benefit payments with respect to that portion of an accrued benefit which was reduced and subsequently restored under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Inactive participant&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, &ldquo;inactive participant&rdquo; means a person not in covered service under the plan who is in pay status under the plan or who has a nonforfeitable benefit under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Promulgation of rules; contents, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules under which, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, accrued benefit reductions or benefit increases for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in contribution rates and other relevant factors reflecting differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing the plan's resource benefit level for each insolvency year, based on the plan sponsor's reasonable projection of the plan's available resources and the benefits payable under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The suspension of benefit payments under this section shall, in accordance with regula<!-- PDFPage:605 -->tions prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, apply in substantially uniform proportions to the benefits of all persons in pay status (within the meaning of section 1421(b)(6) of this title) under the plan, except that the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules under which benefit suspensions for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in contribution rates and other relevant factors including differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if a plan sponsor determines in writing a resource benefit level for a plan year which is below the level of basic benefits, the payment of all benefits other than basic benefits must be suspended for that plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If, by the end of an insolvency year, the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan's available resources in that insolvency year could have supported benefit payments above the resource benefit level for that insolvency year, the plan sponsor shall distribute the excess resources to the participants and beneficiaries who received benefit payments from the plan in that insolvency year, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;excess resources&rdquo; means available resources above the amount necessary to support the resource benefit level, but no greater than the amount necessary to pay benefits for the plan year at the benefit levels under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) As of the end of the first plan year in which a plan is in reorganization, and at least every 3 plan years thereafter (unless the plan is no longer in reorganization), the plan sponsor shall compare the value of plan assets (determined in accordance with section 1423(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title) for that plan year with the total amount of benefit payments made under the plan for that plan year. Unless the plan sponsor determines that the value of plan assets exceeds 3 times the total amount of benefit payments, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years. If the plan sponsor makes such a determination that the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years, the plan sponsor shall make the comparison under this paragraph at least annually until the plan sponsor makes a determination that the plan will not be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, at any time, the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization reasonably determines, taking into account the plan's recent and anticipated financial experience, that the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the next plan year, the plan sponsor shall make such determination available to interested parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing for each insolvency year the resource benefit level and the level of basic benefits no later than 3 months before the insolvency year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice, etc., requirements of plan sponsor of plan in reorganization regarding insolvency and resource benefit levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization determines under subsection (d)(1) or (2) of this section that the plan may become insolvent (within the meaning of subsection (b)(1) of this section), the plan sponsor shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the corporation, the parties described in section 1422(a)(2) of this title, and the plan participants and beneficiaries of that determination, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the plan sponsor anticipates that the resource benefit level for an insolvency year may not exceed the level of basic benefits, the plan sponsor shall notify the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notice required by this subsection shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, except that notice to the Secretary of the Treasury shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The corporation may prescribe a time other than the time prescribed by this section for the making of a determination or the filing of a notice under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Financial assistance from corporation; conditions and criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the plan sponsor of an insolvent plan, for which the resource benefit level is above the level of basic benefits, anticipates that, for any month in an insolvency year, the plan will not have funds sufficient to pay basic benefits, the plan sponsor may apply for financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A plan sponsor who has determined a resource benefit level for an insolvency year which is below the level of basic benefits shall apply for financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title.</p>
