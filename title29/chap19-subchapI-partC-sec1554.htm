<p class="statutory-body">Upon exhaustion of a recipient's grievance procedure without decision, or where the Secretary has reason to believe that the recipient is failing to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the terms of the job training plan, the Secretary shall investigate the allegation or belief and determine within 120 days after receiving the complaint whether such allegation or complaint is true.</p>

The Secretary shall investigate the allegations contained in the grievance and make a determination as to whether a violation of section 1553 of this title has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the results of the investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) indicate that a modification or reversal of the decision issued pursuant to the recipient's grievance procedure is warranted, or the 60-day time period described in subsection (a) of this section has elapsed without a decision, the Secretary may modify or reverse the decision, or issue a decision if no decision has been issued, as the case may be, after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the procedures under section 1576 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines that the decision issued pursuant to the recipient's grievance procedure is appropriate, the determination shall become the final decision of the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person alleging a violation of section 1553 of this title may, as an alternative to the procedures described in this section, submit the grievance involving such violation to a binding grievance procedure if a collective bargaining agreement covering the parties to the grievance so provides.</p>
