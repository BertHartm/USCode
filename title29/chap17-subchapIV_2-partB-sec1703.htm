<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to undertake experimental, research, or demonstration projects to develop or test ways of better using facilities, encouraging a more rapid adjustment of enrollees to community life that will permit a reduction in their period of enrollment, reducing transportation and support costs, or otherwise promoting greater efficiency and effectiveness in the program. These projects shall include one or more projects providing youth with education, training, and other supportive services on a combined residential and nonresidential basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to undertake one or more pilot projects designed to determine the value of Job Corps participation for young adults aged 22 to 24, inclusive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Projects under this subsection shall be developed after appropriate consultation with other Federal or State agencies conducting similar or related programs or projects and with the administrative entity in the communities where the projects will be carried out. They may be undertaken jointly with other Federal or federally assisted programs, and funds otherwise available for activities under those programs shall, with the consent of the head of any agency concerned, be available for projects under this section to the extent they include the same or substantially similar activities. The Secretary is authorized to waive any provision of this part which the Secretary finds would prevent the carrying out of elements of projects under this subsection essential to a determination of their feasibility and usefulness. The Secretary shall, in the annual report of the Secretary, report to the Congress concerning the actions taken under this section, including a full description of progress made in connection with combined residential and nonresidential projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Model community vocational education schools and skill centers</h4>

To carry out this purpose, the Secretary may enter into appropriate arrangements with any Federal or State agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to develop Job Corps programs to test at various centers the efficacy of selected education or training activities authorized under this chapter or any other Act and to appropriately disseminate the results of such tests.

In the event that the Secretary of Labor and the Secretary of Defense agree that such pilot projects should be expanded into permanent programs, the Secretary may establish such permanent programs within the Job Corps, if the Secretary of Defense agrees (1) to provide 50 percent of the costs attributable to such permanent programs, and (2) to reimburse the Secretary of Labor for an additional amount if more than 50 percent of the enrollees in such programs become members of the Armed Forces. Such additional amount shall be equal to a percentage of such costs which is the percentage by which more than 50 percent of such enrollees become such members. In addition to the provision of funds, such reimbursement may include the provision of equipment, materials, transportation, technical assistance, or other assistance, as specified by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Pilot projects using community-based organizations</h4>
