<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Prohibition on combined funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No funds reserved by the Commissioner under this subsection may be combined with funds appropriated under any other Act or part of this chapter if the purpose of combining funds is to make a single discretionary grant or a single discretionary payment, unless such funds appropriated under this part are separately identified in such grant or payment and are used for the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) States</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Maintenance of 1992 amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, the amount of any allotment made under subparagraph (A) to a State for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of financial assistance received by centers for independent living in the State for fiscal year 1992 under part B of this subchapter, as in effect on the day before October 29, 1992.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if such excess is not less than $8,000,000, the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $450,000 or 1/3 of 1 percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $450,000 or 1/3 of 1 percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the 2 amounts;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) if such excess is less than $4,000,000, the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall approach, as nearly as pos<!-- PDFPage:287 -->sible, the greater of the 2 amounts described in clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain territories</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of paragraph (1)(C), Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall not be considered to be States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">To provide allotments to States in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), to provide minimum allotments to States (as increased under paragraph (3)) under paragraph (1)(C), or to provide minimum allotments to States under paragraph (2)(B), the Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the remaining States under paragraph (1)(A), with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any such remaining State from being reduced to less than the amount required by paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by such State for carrying out the provisions of this subpart, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the provisions of this subpart to one or more of the States that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
