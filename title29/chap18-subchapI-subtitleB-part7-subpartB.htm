<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as provided in paragraph (2)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child, following a normal vaginal delivery, to less than 48 hours, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) restrict benefits for any hospital length of stay in connection with childbirth for the mother or newborn child, fol<!-- PDFPage:494 -->lowing a cesarean section, to less than 96 hours; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) require that a provider obtain authorization from the plan or the issuer for prescribing any length of stay required under subparagraph (A) (without regard to paragraph (2)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply in connection with any group health plan or health insurance issuer in any case in which the decision to discharge the mother or her newborn child prior to the expiration of the minimum length of stay otherwise required under paragraph (1)(A) is made by an attending provider in consultation with the mother.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) deny to the mother or her newborn child eligibility, or continued eligibility, to enroll or to renew coverage under the terms of the plan, solely for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide monetary payments or rebates to mothers to encourage such mothers to accept less than the minimum protections available under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) penalize or otherwise reduce or limit the reimbursement of an attending provider because such provider provided care to an individual participant or beneficiary in accordance with this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide incentives (monetary or otherwise) to an attending provider to induce such provider to provide care to an individual participant or beneficiary in a manner inconsistent with this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (c)(3) of this section, restrict benefits for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) of this section in a manner which is less favorable than the benefits provided for any preceding portion of such stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a mother who is a participant or beneficiary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to give birth in a hospital; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time following the birth of her child.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section shall not apply with respect to any group health plan, or any group health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer, which does not provide benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or her newborn child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a group health plan or issuer from imposing deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing in relation to benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or newborn child under the plan (or under health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan), except that such coinsurance or other cost-sharing for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) of this section may not be greater than such coinsurance or cost-sharing for any preceding portion of such stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice under group health plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The imposition of the requirements of this section shall be treated as a material modification in the terms of the plan described in section 1022(a)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1185_1_target" name="1185_1">1</a></sup> of this title, for purposes of assuring notice of such requirements under the plan; except that the summary description required to be provided under the last sentence of section 1024(b)(1) of this title with respect to such modification shall be provided by not later than 60 days after the first day of the first plan year in which such requirements apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Level and type of reimbursements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent a group health plan or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage from negotiating the level and type of reimbursement with a provider for care provided in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Preemption; exception for health insurance coverage in certain States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of this section shall not apply with respect to health insurance coverage if there is a State law (as defined in section 1191(d)(1) of this title) for a State that regulates such coverage that is described in any of the following subparagraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Such State law requires such coverage to provide for at least a 48-hour hospital length of stay following a normal vaginal delivery and at least a 96-hour hospital length of stay following a cesarean section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such State law requires such coverage to provide for maternity and pediatric care in accordance with guidelines established by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or other established professional medical associations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Such State law requires, in connection with such coverage for maternity care, that the hospital length of stay for such care is left to the decision of (or required to be made by) the attending provider in consultation with the mother.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Aggregate lifetime limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) No lifetime limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the plan or coverage does not include an aggregate lifetime limit on substantially all medical and surgical benefits, the plan or coverage may not impose any aggregate lifetime limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Lifetime limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the plan or coverage includes an aggregate lifetime limit on substantially all medical and surgical benefits (in this paragraph referred to as the &ldquo;applicable lifetime limit&rdquo;), the plan or coverage shall either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) apply the applicable lifetime limit both to the medical and surgical benefits to which it otherwise would apply and to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and not distinguish in the application of such limit between such medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not include any aggregate lifetime limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is less than the applicable lifetime limit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Rule in case of different limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan or coverage that is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and that includes no or different aggregate lifetime limits on different categories of medical and surgical benefits, the Secretary shall establish rules under which subparagraph (B) is applied to such plan or coverage with respect to mental health and substance use disorder benefits by substituting for the applicable lifetime limit an average aggregate lifetime limit that is computed taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime limits applicable to such categories.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) No annual limit</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Annual limit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the plan or coverage includes an annual limit on substantially all medical and surgical benefits (in this paragraph referred to as the &ldquo;applicable annual limit&rdquo;), the plan or coverage shall either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) apply the applicable annual limit both to medical and surgical benefits to which it otherwise would apply and to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and not distinguish in the application of such limit between such medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not include any annual limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is less than the applicable annual limit.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Financial requirements and treatment limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits, such plan or coverage shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the financial requirements applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage), and there are no separate cost sharing requirements that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the treatment limitations applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage) and there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this paragraph:</p>

The reason for any denial under the plan (or coverage) of reimbursement or payment for services with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits in the case of any participant or beneficiary shall, on request or as otherwise required, be made available by the plan administrator (or the health insurance issuer offering such coverage) to the participant or beneficiary in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Out-of-network providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a plan or coverage that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits, if the plan or coverage provides coverage for medical or surgical benefits provided by out-of-network providers, the plan or coverage shall provide coverage for mental health or substance use disorder benefits provided by out-of-network providers in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Employers not in existence in preceding year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether such employer is a small employer shall be based on the average number of employees that it is reasonably expected such employer will employ on business days in the current calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Predecessors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any reference in this paragraph to an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of such employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan), if the application of this section to such plan (or coverage) results in an increase for the plan year involved of the actual total costs of coverage with respect to medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits under the plan (as determined and certified under subparagraph (C)) by an amount that exceeds the applicable percentage described in subparagraph (B) of the actual total plan costs, the provisions of this section shall not apply to such plan (or coverage) during the following plan year, and such exemption shall apply to the plan (or coverage) for 1 plan year.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) 6-month determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a group health plan (or a health insurance issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) seeks an exemption under this paragraph, determinations under subparagraph (A) shall be made after such plan (or coverage) has complied with this section for the first 6 months of the plan year involved.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Notification</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A group health plan (or a health insurance issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) that, based upon a certification described under subparagraph (C), qualifies for an exemption under this paragraph, and elects to implement the exemption, shall promptly notify the Secretary, the appropriate State agencies, and participants and beneficiaries in the plan of such election.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) for both the plan year upon which a cost exemption is sought and the year prior, the actual total costs of coverage with respect to mental health and substance use disorder benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Confidentiality</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a summary of the data received under clause (ii).</p>

A State agency receiving a notification under subparagraph (E) may also conduct such an audit with respect to an exemption covered by such notification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Separate application to each option offered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a group health plan that offers a participant or beneficiary two or more benefit package options under the plan, the requirements of this section shall be applied separately with respect to each such option.</p>
