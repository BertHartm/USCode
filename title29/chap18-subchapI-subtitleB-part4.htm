<p class="statutory-body">This part shall apply to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003(a) of this title (and not exempted under section 1003(b) of this title), other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any agreement described in section 736 of title 26, which provides payments to a retired partner or deceased partner or a deceased partner's successor in interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Securities or policies deemed to be included in plan assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of a plan which invests in any security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 et seq.], the assets of such plan shall be deemed to include such security but shall not, solely by reason of such investment, be deemed to include any assets of such investment company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a plan to which a guaranteed benefit policy is issued by an insurer, the assets of such plan shall be deemed to include such policy, but shall not, solely by reason of the issuance of such policy, be deemed to include any assets of such insurer. For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; means an insurance company, insurance service, or insurance organization, qualified to do business in a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The term &ldquo;guaranteed benefit policy&rdquo; means an insurance policy or contract to the extent that such policy or contract provides for benefits the amount of which is guaranteed by the insurer. Such term includes any surplus in a separate account, but excludes any other portion of a separate account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Clarification of application of ERISA to insurance company general accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Not later than June 30, 1997, the Secretary shall issue proposed regulations to provide guidance for the purpose of determining, in cases where an insurer issues 1 or more policies to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan (and such policies are supported by assets of such insurer's general account), which assets held by the insurer (other than plan assets held in its separate accounts) constitute assets of the plan for purposes of this part and section 4975 of title 26 and to provide guidance with respect to the application of this subchapter to the general account assets of insurers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The proposed regulations under subparagraph (A) shall be subject to public notice and comment until September 30, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall issue final regulations providing the guidance described in subparagraph (A) not later than December 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Such regulations shall only apply with respect to policies which are issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998, to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan which is supported by assets of such insurer's general account. With respect to policies issued on or before December 31, 1998, such regulations shall take effect at the end of the 18-month period following the date on which such regulations become final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall ensure that the regulations issued under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are administratively feasible, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) protect the interests and rights of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries (including meeting the requirements of paragraph (3)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The regulations prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) shall require, in connection with any policy issued by an insurer to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan to the extent that the policy is not a guaranteed benefit policy (as defined in subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that a plan fiduciary totally independent of the insurer authorize the purchase of such policy (unless such purchase is a transaction exempt under section 1108(b)(5) of this title),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the insurer describe (in such form and manner as shall be prescribed in such regulations), in annual reports and in policies issued to the policyholder after the date on which such regulations are issued in final form pursuant to paragraph (1)(C)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a description of the method by which any income and expenses of the insurer's general account are allocated to the policy during the term of the policy and upon the termination of the policy, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for each report, the actual return to the plan under the policy and such other financial information as the Secretary may deem appropriate for the period covered by each such annual report,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that the insurer disclose to the plan fiduciary the extent to which alternative arrangements supported by assets of separate accounts of the insurer (which generally hold plan assets) are available, whether there is a right under the policy to transfer funds to a separate account and the terms governing any such right, and the extent to which support by assets of the insurer's general account and support by assets of separate accounts of the insurer might pose differing risks to the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that the insurer manage those assets of the insurer which are assets of such insurer's general account (irrespective of whether any such assets are plan assets) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, taking into account all obligations supported by such enterprise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Compliance by the insurer with all requirements of the regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deemed com<!-- PDFPage:402 -->pliance by such insurer with sections 1104, 1106, and 1107 of this title with respect to those assets of the insurer's general account which support a policy described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), any regulations issued under paragraph (1) shall not take effect before the date on which such regulations become final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No person shall be subject to liability under this part or section 4975 of title 26 for conduct which occurred before the date which is 18 months following the date described in subparagraph (A) on the basis of a claim that the assets of an insurer (other than plan assets held in a separate account) constitute assets of the plan, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as otherwise provided by the Secretary in regulations intended to prevent avoidance of the regulations issued under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) as provided in an action brought by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2) or (5) of section 1132(a) of this title for a breach of fiduciary responsibilities which would also constitute a violation of Federal or State criminal law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall bring a cause of action described in clause (ii) if a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a breach described in clause (ii) has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the application of any Federal criminal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;policy&rdquo; includes a contract.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if he participates knowingly in, or knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if, by his failure to comply with section 1104(a)(1) of this title in the administration of his specific responsibilities which give rise to his status as a fiduciary, he has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a breach; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if he has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assets held by two or more trustees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section and in section 1103(a)(1) and (2) of this title, if the assets of a plan are held by two or more trustees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each shall use reasonable care to prevent a co-trustee from committing a breach; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) they shall jointly manage and control the assets of the plan, except that nothing in this subparagraph (B) shall preclude any agreement, authorized by the trust instrument, allocating specific responsibilities, obligations, or duties among trustees, in which event a trustee to whom certain responsibilities, obligations, or duties have not been allocated shall not be liable by reason of this subparagraph (B) either individually or as a trustee for any loss resulting to the plan arising from the acts or omissions on the part of another trustee to whom such responsibilities, obligations, or duties have been allocated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall limit any liability that a fiduciary may have under subsection (a) of this section or any other provision of this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a plan the assets of which are held in more than one trust, a trustee shall not be liable under paragraph (1) except with respect to an act or omission of a trustee of a trust of which he is a trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No trustee shall be liable under this subsection for following instructions referred to in section 1103(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:407 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of fiduciary responsibility; designated persons to carry out fiduciary responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The instrument under which a plan is maintained may expressly provide for procedures (A) for allocating fiduciary responsibilities (other than trustee responsibilities) among named fiduciaries, and (B) for named fiduciaries to designate persons other than named fiduciaries to carry out fiduciary responsibilities (other than trustee responsibilities) under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a plan expressly provides for a procedure described in paragraph (1), and pursuant to such procedure any fiduciary responsibility of a named fiduciary is allocated to any person, or a person is designated to carry out any such responsibility, then such named fiduciary shall not be liable for an act or omission of such person in carrying out such responsibility except to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the named fiduciary violated section 1104(a)(1) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) with respect to such allocation or designation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) with respect to the establishment or implementation of the procedure under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in continuing the allocation or designation; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />

In the case of a plan in existence on September 2, 1974, this subparagraph shall not take effect until January 1, 1976.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The term &ldquo;eligible individual account plan&rdquo; does not include any individual account plan the benefits of which are taken into account in determining the benefits payable to a participant under any defined benefit plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;qualifying employer real property&rdquo; means parcels of employer real property&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grant of exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish an exemption procedure for purposes of this subsection. Pursuant to such procedure, he may grant a conditional or unconditional exemption of any fiduciary or transaction, or class of fiduciaries or transactions, from all or part of the restrictions imposed by sections 1106 and 1107(a) of this title. Action under this subsection may be taken only after consultation and coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury. An exemption granted under this section shall not relieve a fiduciary from any other applicable provision of this chapter. The Secretary may not grant an exemption under this subsection unless he finds that such exemption is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) administratively feasible,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before granting an exemption under this subsection from section 1106(a) or 1107(a) of this title, the Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the exemption, shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and shall afford interested persons opportunity to present views. The Secretary may not grant an exemption under this subsection from section 1106(b) of this title unless he affords an opportunity for a hearing and makes a determination on the record with respect to the findings required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enumeration of transactions exempted from section 1106 prohibitions</h4>

A loan made by a plan shall not fail to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence by reason of a loan repayment suspension described under section 414(u)(4) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Contracting or making reasonable arrangements with a party in interest for office space, or legal, accounting, or other services necessary for the establishment or operation of the plan, if no more than reasonable compensation is paid therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A loan to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 1107(d)(6) of this title), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such loan is primarily for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries of the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such loan is at an interest rate which is not in excess of a reasonable rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the plan gives collateral to a party in interest for such loan, such collateral may consist only of qualifying employer securities (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The investment of all or part of a plan's assets in deposits which bear a reasonable interest rate in a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan covers only employees of such bank or other institution and employees of affiliates of such bank or other institution, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such investment is expressly authorized by a provision of the plan or by a fiduciary (other than such bank or institution or affiliate thereof) who is expressly empowered by the plan to so instruct the trustee with respect to such investment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Any contract for life insurance, health insurance, or annuities with one or more insurers which are qualified to do business in a State, if the plan pays no more than adequate consideration, and if each such insurer or insurers is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the employer maintaining the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a party in interest which is wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the employer maintaining the plan, or by any person which is a party in interest with respect to the plan, but only if the total premiums and annuity considerations written by such insurers for life insurance, health insurance, or annuities for all plans (and their employers) with respect to which such insurers are parties in interest (not including premiums or annuity considerations written by the employer maintaining the plan) do not exceed 5 percent of the total premiums and annuity considerations written for all lines of insurance in that year by such insurers (not <!-- PDFPage:412 -->including premiums or annuity considerations written by the employer maintaining the plan).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The providing of any ancillary service by a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan, and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such bank or similar financial institution has adopted adequate internal safeguards which assure that the providing of such ancillary service is consistent with sound banking and financial practice, as determined by Federal or State supervisory authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which such ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by such bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Secretary after consultation with Federal and State supervisory authority), and adherence to such guidelines would reasonably preclude such bank or similar financial institution from providing such ancillary service (i) in an excessive or unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such ancillary services shall not be provided at more than reasonable compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The exercise of a privilege to convert securities, to the extent provided in regulations of the Secretary, but only if the plan receives no less than adequate consideration pursuant to such conversion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the transaction is a sale or purchase of an interest in the fund,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the bank, trust company, or insurance company receives not more than reasonable compensation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such transaction is expressly permitted by the instrument under which the plan is maintained, or by a fiduciary (other than the bank, trust company, or insurance company, or an affiliate thereof) who has authority to manage and control the assets of the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The making by a fiduciary of a distribution of the assets of the plan in accordance with the terms of the plan if such assets are distributed in the same manner as provided under section 1344 of this title (relating to allocation of assets).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Any transaction required or permitted under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) A merger of multiemployer plans, or the transfer of assets or liabilities between multiemployer plans, determined by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to meet the requirements of section 1411 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The sale by a plan to a party in interest on or after December 18, 1987, of any stock, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (e) of this section are met with respect to such stock,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the later of the date on which the stock was acquired by the plan, or January 1, 1975, such stock constituted a qualifying employer security (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title as then in effect), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such stock does not constitute a qualifying employer security (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title as in effect at the time of the sale).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Any transfer made before January 1, 2014, of excess pension assets from a defined benefit plan to a retiree health account in a qualified transfer permitted under section 420 of title 26 (as in effect on October 22, 2004).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) receiving any reasonable compensation for services rendered, or for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred, in the performance of his duties with the plan; except that no person so serving who already receives full time pay from an employer or an association of employers, whose employees are participants in the plan, or from an employee organization whose members are participants in such plan shall receive compensation from such plan, except for reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred; or</p>

Such bond shall provide protection to the plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the plan official, directly or through connivance with others. Any bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to sections 9304&ndash;9308 of title 31. Any bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary, including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unlawful acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any plan official to whom subsection (a) of this section applies, to receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control of any of the funds or other property of any employee benefit plan, without being bonded as required by subsection (a) of this section and it shall be unlawful for any plan official of such plan, or any other person having authority to direct the performance of such functions, to permit such functions, or any of them, to be performed by any plan official, with respect to whom the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have not been met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conflict of interest prohibited in procuring bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any person to procure any bond required by subsection (a) of this section from any surety or other company or through any agent or broker in whose business operations such plan or any party in interest in such plan has any control or significant financial interest, direct or indirect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusiveness of statutory basis for bonding requirement for persons handling funds or other property of employee benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in any other provision of law shall require any person, required to be bonded as provided in subsection (a) of this section because he handles funds or other property of an employee benefit plan, to be bonded insofar as the handling by such person of the funds or other property of such plan is concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section including exempting a plan from the requirements of this section where he finds that (1) other bonding arrangements or (2) the overall financial condition of the plan would be adequate to protect the interests of the beneficiaries and participants. When, in the opinion of the Secretary, the administrator of a plan offers adequate evidence of the financial responsibility of the plan, or that other bonding arrangements would provide adequate protection of the beneficiaries and participants, he may exempt such plan from the requirements of this section.</p>
