<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, for each fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment of an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount authorized to be appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section as the product of (A) the population of the State, and (B) the square of its allotment percentage, bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment in an amount equal to the amount such State received under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and an additional amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment, from any amount authorized to be appropriated for such fiscal year under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title for allotment under this section in excess of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, in an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and the square of its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The sum of the payment to any State (other than Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau) under this subsection for any fiscal year which is less than one-third of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title, or $3,000,000, whichever is greater, shall be increased to that amount, the total of the increases thereby required being derived by proportionately reducing the allotment to each of the remaining such States under this subsection, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the sum of the allotments made under this subsection to any such remaining State from being thereby reduced to less than that amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1984, for which any amount is appropriated pursuant to section 720(b)(1)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title, each State shall receive an allocation (from such appropriated amount) in addition to the allotment to which such State is entitled under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection. Such additional allocation shall be an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount so appropriated as that State's allotment under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection bears to the sum of such allotments of all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Republic of Palau may receive allotments or allocations under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional payments; authorization of additional appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the payment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for a fiscal year is less than the total payments such State received under section 2 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, such State shall be entitled to an additional payment (subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to other payments under this part) equal to the difference between such payment under section 731(a) of this title and the amount so received by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a State receives as its Federal share under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year less than the applicable Federal share of the expenditure of such State for fiscal year 1972 for vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for such State approved under section 721 of this title (including any amount expended by such State for the administration of the State plan but excluding any amount expended by such State from non-Federal sources for construction under such plan), such State shall be entitled to an additional payment for such fiscal year, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to other payments under this part, equal to the difference between such payment under section 731(a) of this title and an amount equal to the applicable Federal share of such expenditure for vocational rehabilitation services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any payment attributable to the additional payment to a State under this subsection shall be made only from appropriations specifically made to carry out this subsection, and such additional appropriations are hereby authorized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unused funds; redistribution; increase in amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than forty-five days prior to the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall determine, after reasonable opportunity for the submission to the Commissioner of comments by the State agency administering or supervising the program established under this subchapter, that any payment of an allotment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year will not be utilized by such State in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable but not later than the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter to one or more other States to the extent the Commissioner determines that such other State will be able to use such additional amount during that fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year for car<!-- PDFPage:227 -->rying out such purposes. The Commissioner shall make such amount available only if such other State will be able to make sufficient payments from non-Federal sources to pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the State plan for the fiscal year for which the amount was appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this part, any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection shall be regarded as an increase of such State's allotment (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funds for American Indian vocational rehabilitation services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For fiscal year 1987 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Commissioner shall reserve from the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section a sum, determined under paragraph (2), to carry out the purposes of part D of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The sum referred to in paragraph (1) shall be, as determined by the Secretary&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), from each State's allotment under this part for any fiscal year, the Commissioner shall pay to a State an amount equal to the Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for that State approved under section 721 of this title, including expenditures for the administration of the State plan and development and implementation of the strategic plan as provided in section 721(a)(34)(A) of this title. Any State that receives such an amount shall expend, for development and implementation of the strategic plan, not less than the percentage of the allotment of the State referred to in section 721(a)(34)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The total of payments under paragraph (1) to a State for a fiscal year may not exceed its allotment under subsection (a),<sup><a href="#731_1_target" name="731_1">1</a></sup> of section 730 of this title for such year and such payments shall not be made in an amount which would result in a violation of the provisions of the State plan required by section 721(a)(17) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) For fiscal year 1993, the amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for the previous fiscal year are less than the average of the total of such expenditures for the 3 fiscal years preceding the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For fiscal year 1994 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for the previous fiscal year are less than the total of such expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commissioner may waive or modify any requirement or limitation under paragraphs (A) and (B) if the Commissioner determines that a waiver or modification is an equitable response to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of a payment under this section with respect to any construction project in any State shall be equal to the same percentage of the cost of such project as the Federal share that is applicable in the case of rehabilitation facilities (as defined in section 291<em>o</em>(g) of title 42), in such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Federal share with respect to rehabilitation facilities in such State is determined pursuant to section 291<em>o</em>(b)(2) of title 42, the percentage of the cost for purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner designed to achieve as nearly as practicable results comparable to the results obtained under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of computation and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method of computing and paying amounts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Commissioner shall, prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter or other period prescribed by the Commissioner, estimate the amount to be paid to each State under the provisions of such subsection for such period, such estimate to be based on such records of the State and information furnished by it, and such other investigation as the Commissioner may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commissioner shall pay, from the allotment available therefor, the amount so estimated by the Commissioner for such period, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (not previously adjusted under this paragraph) by which the Commissioner finds that the estimate of the amount to be paid the State for any prior period under such subsection was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such prior period under such subsection. Such payment shall be made prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office, shall be made through the disbursing facilities of the Treasury Department, and shall be made in such installments as the Commissioner may determine.</p>
