<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Civil money penalties for violations; criteria for assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), any person who commits a violation of this chapter or any regulation under this chapter, may be assessed a civil money penalty of not more than $1,000 for each violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the amount of any penalty to be assessed under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall take into account (A) the previous record of the person in terms of compliance with this chapter and with comparable requirements of the Farm Labor Contractor Registration Act of 1963 [7 U.S.C. 2041 et seq.], and with regulations promulgated under this chapter and such Act, and (B) the gravity of the violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The person assessed shall be afforded an opportunity for agency hearing, upon request made within thirty days after the date of issuance of the notice of assessment. In such hearing, all issues shall be determined on the record pursuant to section 554 of title 5. If no hearing is requested as herein provided, the assessment shall constitute a final and unappealable order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a hearing is requested, the initial agency decision shall be made by an administrative law judge, and such decision shall become the final <!-- PDFPage:694 -->order unless the Secretary modifies or vacates the decision. Notice of intent to modify or vacate the decision of the administrative law judge shall be issued to the parties within thirty days after the decision of the administrative law judge. A final order which takes effect under this paragraph shall be subject to review only as provided under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person against whom an order imposing a civil money penalty has been entered after an agency hearing under this section may obtain review by the United States district court for any district in which he is located or the United States District Court for the District of Columbia by filing a notice of appeal in such court within thirty days from the date of such order, and simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by registered mail to the Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly certify and file in such court the record upon which the penalty was imposed. The findings of the Secretary shall be set aside only if found to be unsupported by substantial evidence as provided by section 706(2)(E) of title 5. Any final decision, order, or judgment of such District Court concerning such review shall be subject to appeal as provided in chapter 83 of title 28.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Failure to pay assessment; maintenance of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person fails to pay an assessment after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the court has entered final judgment in favor of the agency, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General, who shall recover the amount assessed by action in the appropriate United States district court. In such action the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment of penalties into Treasury of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All penalties collected under authority of this section shall be paid into the Treasury of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maintenance of civil action in district court by aggrieved person</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person aggrieved by a violation of this chapter or any regulation under this chapter by a farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, agricultural association, or other person may file suit in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy and without regard to the citizenship of the parties and without regard to exhaustion of any alternative administrative remedies provided herein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointment of attorney and commencement of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon application by a complainant and in such circumstances as the court may deem just, the court may appoint an attorney for such complainant and may authorize the commencement of the action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Award of damages or other equitable relief; amount; criteria; appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the court finds that the respondent has intentionally violated any provision of this chapter or any regulation under this chapter, it may award damages up to and including an amount equal to the amount of actual damages, or statutory damages of up to $500 per plaintiff per violation, or other equitable relief, except that (A) multiple infractions of a single provision of this chapter or of regulations under this chapter shall constitute only one violation for purposes of determining the amount of statutory damages due a plaintiff; and (B) if such complaint is certified as a class action, the court shall award no more than the lesser of up to $500 per plaintiff per violation, or up to $500,000 or other equitable relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the amount of damages to be awarded under paragraph (1), the court is authorized to consider whether an attempt was made to resolve the issues in dispute before the resort to litigation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Workers&rsquo; compensation benefits; exclusive remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, where a State workers&rsquo; compensation law is applicable and coverage is provided for a migrant or seasonal agricultural worker, the workers&rsquo; compensation benefits shall be the exclusive remedy for loss of such worker under this chapter in the case of bodily injury or death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exclusive remedy prescribed by paragraph (1) precludes the recovery under subsection (c) of this section of actual damages for loss from an injury or death but does not preclude recovery under subsection (c) of this section for statutory damages or an injunction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A migrant or seasonal agricultural worker who believes, with just cause, that he has been discriminated against by any person in violation of this section may, within 180 days after such violation occurs, file a complaint with the Secretary alleging such discrimination.
