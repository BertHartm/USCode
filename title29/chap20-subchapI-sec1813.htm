In such hearing, all issues shall be determined on the record pursuant to section 554 of title 5.

The Secretary shall promptly certify and file in such court the record upon which the order was based. The findings of the Secretary shall be set aside only if found to be unsupported by substantial evidence as provided by section 706(2)(E) of title 5.
