<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is essential that criteria for measuring the return on this investment be developed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the basic return on the investment is to be measured by long-term economic self-sufficiency, increased employment and earnings, reductions in welfare dependency, and increased educational attainment and occupational skills.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subchapter II performance standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing performance standards for programs under parts A and C of subchapter II of this chapter, the Secretary shall ensure that States and service delivery areas will make efforts to increase services and positive outcomes for hard-to-serve individuals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) To the extent that a State workers&rsquo; compensation law is applicable, workers&rsquo; compensation benefits in accordance with such law shall <!-- PDFPage:611 -->be available with respect to injuries suffered by participants. To the extent that such law is not applicable, each recipient of funds under this chapter shall secure insurance coverage for injuries suffered by such participants, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All individuals employed in subsidized jobs shall be provided benefits and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as other employees working a similar length of time and doing the same type of work.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) existing contracts for services; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) existing collective bargaining agreements, unless the employer and the labor organization concur in writing with respect to any elements of the proposed activities which affect such agreement, or either such party fails to respond to written notification requesting its concurrence within 30 days of receipt thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No participant shall be employed or job opening filled (A) when any other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job, or (B) when the employer has terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced its workforce with the intention of filling the vacancy so created by hiring a participant whose wages are subsidized under this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Maintenance and timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each administrative entity, contractor, and grantee under this chapter shall establish and maintain a grievance procedure for grievances or complaints about its programs and activities from participants, subgrantees, subcontractors, and other interested persons. Hearings on any grievance shall be conducted within 30 days of filing of a grievance and decisions shall be made not later than 60 days after the filing of a grievance. Except for complaints alleging fraud or criminal activity, complaints shall be made within one year of the alleged occurrence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirement for recipient grievance procedure</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Investigation by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon exhaustion of a recipient's grievance procedure without decision, or where the Secretary has reason to believe that the recipient is failing to comply with the requirements of this chapter or the terms of the job training plan, the Secretary shall investigate the allegation or belief and determine within 120 days after receiving the complaint whether such allegation or complaint is true.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Labor standards violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a person alleges a violation of section 1553 of this title and such person exhausts the recipient's grievance procedure or the 60-day time period described in subsection (a) of this section has elapsed without a decision, either party to such procedure may submit the grievance to the Secretary. The Secretary shall investigate the allegations contained in the grievance and make a determination as to whether a violation of section 1553 of this title has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the results of the investigation conducted pursuant to paragraph (1) indicate that a modification or reversal of the decision issued pursuant to the recipient's grievance procedure is warranted, or the 60-day time period described in subsection (a) of this section has elapsed without a decision, the Secretary may modify or reverse the decision, or issue a decision if no decision has been issued, as the case may be, after an opportunity for a hearing in accordance with the procedures under section 1576 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines that the decision issued pursuant to the recipient's grievance procedure is appropriate, the determination shall become the final decision of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Alternative procedure for labor standards grievances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person alleging a violation of section 1553 of this title may, as an alternative to the procedures described in this section, submit the grievance involving such violation to a binding grievance procedure if a collective bargaining agreement covering the parties to the grievance so provides.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The remedies available under paragraph (1) shall be limited to the remedies available under subsection (f)(1)(C) of this section and subsection (f)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Remedies for labor standards violations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) appropriate equitable relief (other than back pay).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The Comptroller General shall conduct the evaluations whenever he determines it necessary and he shall periodically report to the Congress on the findings of such evaluations.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recipient's liability for noncomplying expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every recipient shall repay to the United States amounts found not to have been expended in accordance with this chapter. The Secretary may offset such amounts against any other amount to which the recipient is or may be entitled under this chapter unless he determines that such recipient should be held liable pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. No such action shall be taken except after notice and opportunity for a hearing have been given to the recipient.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines that the recipient has demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2), the Secretary may waive the imposition of sanctions authorized by this section upon such recipient.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Emergency situations and immediate termination</h4>
