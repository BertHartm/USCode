<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Population basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from sums appropriated for each fiscal year to carry out this part (not including sums used in accordance with section 721(a)(34)(B) of this title), the Commissioner shall make an allotment to each State whose State plan has been approved under section 721 of this title of an amount bearing the same ratio to such sums as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this part, the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $200,000 or one-third of one percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $200,000 or one-third of one percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain territories</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of paragraph (1)(B), Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau shall not be considered to be States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each jurisdiction described in subparagraph (A) shall be allotted under paragraph (1)(A) not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available for purposes of this part for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, except that the Republic of Palau may receive such allotment under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustment for inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1994, in which the total amount appropriated to carry out this part exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this part for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Commissioner shall increase the minimum allotment under paragraph (1)(B) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proportional reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide minimum allotments to States (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, or to provide minimum allotments to States under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, the Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the remaining States under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any such remaining State from being reduced to less than the minimum allotment for a State (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, or the minimum allotment for a State under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a State for any <!-- PDFPage:230 -->fiscal year will not be expended by such State for carrying out the provisions of this part, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this part to one or more of the States that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
