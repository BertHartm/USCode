<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Secretary of Labor shall establish a Federal Advisory Council composed of men and women representing employers and employees in equal numbers and the public for the purpose of formulating policies and discussing problems relating to employment and insuring impartiality, neutrality, and freedom from political influence in the solution of such problems. Members of such council shall be selected from time to time in such manner as the Secretary shall prescribe and shall serve without compensation, but when attending meetings of the council they shall be allowed necessary traveling and subsistence expenses, or per diem allowance in lieu thereof, within the limitations prescribed by law for civilian employees in the executive branch of the Government. The council shall have access to all files and records of the United States Employment Service. The Secretary shall also require the organization of similar State advisory councils composed of men and women representing employers and employees in equal numbers and the public. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the Governor from carrying out functions of such State advisory council through the State job training coordinating council in accordance with section 1532(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In carrying out the provisions of this chapter the Secretary is authorized and directed to provide for the giving of notice of strikes or lockouts to applicants before they are referred to employment.</p>
