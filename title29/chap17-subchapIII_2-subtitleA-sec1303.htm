The corporation shall annually audit a statistically significant number of plans terminating under section 1341(b) of this title to determine whether participants and beneficiaries have received their benefit commitments and whether section 1350(a) of this title has been satisfied. Each audit shall include a statistically significant number of participants and beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discovery powers vested in board members or officers designated by the chairman</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of any such investigation, or any other proceeding under this subchapter, any member of the board of directors of the corporation, or any officer designated by the chairman, may administer oaths and affirmations, subpena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence, and require the production of any books, papers, correspondence, memoranda, or other records which the corporation deems relevant or material to the inquiry.</p>

The court may issue an order requiring such person to appear before the corporation, or member or officer designated by the corporation, and to produce records or to give testimony related to the matter under investigation or in question. Any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof. All process in any such case may be served in the judicial district in which such person is an inhabitant or may be found.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cooperation with other governmental agencies</h4>
