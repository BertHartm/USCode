<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Alternative methods of providing retraining services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A substate grantee may provide retraining services described in section 1661c(d) of this title to an eligible dislocated worker&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by beginning such services promptly upon the worker's application for the program under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by deferring the beginning of such services and providing the worker with a certificate of continuing eligibility in accordance with subsection (b)(1) and (2) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by permitting the worker to obtain such services from a service provider using such certificate in accordance with subsection (b)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of continuing eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A substate grantee may issue to any eligible dislocated worker who has applied for the program authorized in this part a certificate of continuing eligibility. Such a certificate of continuing eligibility may be effective for periods not to exceed 104 weeks. No such certificate shall include any reference to any specific amount of funds. Any such certificate shall state that it is subject to the availability of funds at the time that any such training services are to be provided. Acceptance of such a certificate shall not be deemed to be enrollment in training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any individual to whom a certificate of continuing eligibility has been issued under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall remain eligible for the program authorized under this part for the period specified in the certificate, notwithstanding section 1651(a) of this title, and may use the certificate in order to receive the retraining services, subject to the limitations contained in the certificate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A substate grantee may provide training services through systems that permit eligible dislocated workers to use certificates of continuing eligibility to seek out and arrange their own retraining with service providers approved by that substate grantee. Retraining provided pursuant to the certificate shall be conducted under a grant, contract, or other arrangement between the substate grantee and the service provider.</p>
