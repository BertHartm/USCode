<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Designation of areas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, and consistent with paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), in order for a State to receive an allotment under section 2852 or 2862 of this title, the Governor of the State shall designate local workforce investment areas within the State&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making the designation of local areas, the Governor shall take into consideration the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Geographic areas served by local educational agencies and intermediate educational agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Geographic areas served by postsecondary educational institutions and area vocational education schools.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The extent to which such local areas are consistent with labor market areas.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:746 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from any unit of general local government with a population of 500,000 or more;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) of the area served by a rural concentrated employment program grant recipient of demonstrated effectiveness that served as a service delivery area or substate area under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.], if the grant recipient has submitted the request; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) of an area that served as a service delivery area under section 101(a)(4)(A)(ii) of the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1511(a)(4)(A)(ii)] (as in effect on the day before August 7, 1998) in a State that has a population of not more than 1,100,000 and a population density greater than 900 persons per square mile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Temporary and subsequent designation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding paragraph (2)(A), the Governor shall approve any request, made not later than the date of submission of the initial State plan under this subchapter, for temporary designation as a local area from any unit of general local government (including a combination of such units) with a population of 200,000 or more that was a service delivery area under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] on the day before August 7, 1998, if the Governor determines that the area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) performed successfully, in each of the last 2 years prior to the request for which data are available, in the delivery of services to participants under part A of title II and title III of the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., 1651 et seq.] (as in effect on such day); and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Duration and subsequent designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A temporary designation under this paragraph shall be for a period of not more than 2 years, after which the designation shall be extended until the end of the period covered by the State plan if the Governor determines that, during the temporary designation period, the area substantially met (as defined by the State board) the local performance measures for the local area and sustained the fiscal integrity of the funds used by the area to carry out activities under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Technical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall provide the States with technical assistance in making the determinations required by this paragraph. The Secretary shall not issue regulations governing determinations to be made under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Performed successfully</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;performed successfully&rdquo; means that the area involved met or exceeded the performance standards for activities administered in the area that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are established by the Secretary for each year and modified by the adjustment methodology of the State (used to account for differences in economic conditions, participant characteristics, and combination of services provided from the combination assumed for purposes of the established standards of the Secretary); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) if the area was designated as both a service delivery area and a substate area under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] (as in effect on the day before August 7, 1998)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;sustained the fiscal integrity&rdquo;, used with respect to funds used by a service delivery area or local area, means that the Secretary has not made a final determination during any of the last 3 years for which data are available, prior to the date of the designation request involved, that either the grant recipient or the administrative entity of the area misexpended the funds due to willful disregard of the requirements of the Act involved, gross negligence, or failure to observe accepted standards of administration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Designation on recommendation of State board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Governor may approve a request from any unit of general local government (including a combination of such units) for designation (including temporary designation) as a local area if the State board determines, taking into account the factors described in clauses (i) through (v) of paragraph (1)(B), and recommends to the Governor, that such area should be so designated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A unit of general local government (including a combination of such units) or grant recipient that requests but is not granted designation of an area as a local area under paragraph (2) or (3) may submit an appeal to the State board under an appeal process established in the State plan. If the appeal does not result in such a designation, the Secretary, after receiving a request for review from the unit or grant recipient and on determining that the unit or grant recipient was not accorded procedural rights under the appeal process established in the State plan or that the area meets the requirements of paragraph (2) or (3), as appropriate, may require that the <!-- PDFPage:747 -->area be designated as a local area under such paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Small States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Governor of any State that was a single State service delivery area under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] as of July 1, 1998, may designate the State as a single State local area for the purposes of this chapter.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Information sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State may require the local boards for a designated region to share, in feasible cases, employment statistics, information about employment opportunities and trends, and other types of information that would assist in improving the performance of all local areas in the designated region on local performance measures.</p>
