<p class="note-body">Section 42&ndash;1, act June 2, 1920, ch. 219, &sect;15, as added July 7, 1968, Pub. L. 90&ndash;391, &sect;13, 82 Stat. 304; amended Dec. 31, 1970, Pub.

<p class="note-body">Section 42a, act June 2, 1920, ch. 219, &sect;16, formerly &sect;17, as added Oct. 3, 1967, Pub. L. 90&ndash;99, &sect;4, 81 Stat. 251; renumbered July 7, 1968, Pub.
