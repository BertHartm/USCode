<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, a complete withdrawal from a multiemployer plan occurs when an employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Building and construction industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the building and construction industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) substantially all the employees with respect to whom the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan perform work in the building and construction industry, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is amended to provide that this subsection applies to employers described in this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) resumes such work within 5 years after the date on which the obligation to contribute under the plan ceases, and does not renew the obligation at the time of the resumption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a plan terminated by mass withdrawal (within the meaning of section 1341a(a)(2) of this title), paragraph (2) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3 years&rdquo; for &ldquo;5 years&rdquo; in subparagraph (B)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Entertainment industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the entertainment industry, primarily on a temporary or project-by-project basis, if the plan primarily covers employees in the entertainment industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in subsection (b)(2) of this section applied by substituting &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for &ldquo;collective bargaining agreement&rdquo; in subparagraph (B)(i) thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;entertainment industry&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) theater, motion picture (except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation), radio, television, sound or visual recording, music, and dance, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other entertainment activities as the corporation may determine to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation may by regulation exclude a group or class of employers described in the <!-- PDFPage:517 -->preceding sentence from the application of this subsection if the corporation determines that such exclusion is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to protect the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prevent a significant risk of loss to the corporation with respect to the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A plan may be amended to provide that this subsection shall not apply to a group or class of employers under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has an obligation to contribute under a plan described in paragraph (2) primarily for work described in such paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) does not continue to perform work within the jurisdiction of the plan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A plan is described in this paragraph if substantially all of the contributions required under the plan are made by employers primarily engaged in the long and short haul trucking industry, the household goods moving industry, or the public warehousing industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the corporation determines that the plan has suffered substantial damage to its contribution base as a result of such cessation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employer fails to furnish a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to 50 percent of the withdrawal liability of the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If, after an employer furnishes a bond or escrow to a plan under paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the corporation determines that the cessation of the employer's obligation to contribute under the plan (considered together with any cessations by other employers), or cessation of covered operations under the plan, has resulted in substantial damage to the contribution base of the plan, the employer shall be treated as having withdrawn from the plan on the date on which the obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased, and such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan. The corporation shall not make a determination under this paragraph more than 60 months after the date on which such obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the corporation determines that the employer has no further liability under the plan either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) because it determines that the contribution base of the plan has not suffered substantial damage as a result of the cessation of the employer's obligation to contribute or cessation of covered operations (considered together with any cessation of contribution obligation, or of covered operations, with respect to other employers), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) because it may not make a determination under paragraph (4) because of the last sentence thereof,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the bond shall be cancelled or the escrow refunded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a limitation on the amount of the withdrawal liability of any employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Date of complete withdrawal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the date of a complete withdrawal is the date of the cessation of the obligation to contribute or the cessation of covered operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special liability withdrawal rules for industries other than construction and entertainment industries; procedures applicable to amend plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may prescribe regulations under which plans in industries other than the construction or entertainment industries may be amended to provide for special withdrawal liability rules similar to the rules described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Regulations under paragraph (1) shall permit use of special withdrawal liability rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) only in industries (or portions thereof) in which, as determined by the corporation, the characteristics that would make use of such rules appropriate are clearly shown, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) only if the corporation determines, in each instance in which special withdrawal liability rules are permitted, that use of such rules will not pose a significant risk to the corporation under this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;seller&rdquo;) under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm's-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo;), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the purchaser provides to the plan for a period of 5 plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the sale of as<!-- PDFPage:518 -->sets, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the average annual contribution required to be made by the seller with respect to the operations under the plan for the 3 plan years preceding the plan year in which the sale of the employer's assets occurs, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">which bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan, or fails to make a contribution to the plan when due, at any time during the first 5 plan years beginning after the sale; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) There is a 70-percent contribution decline for any plan year if during each plan year in the 3-year testing period the employer's contribution base units do not exceed 30 percent of the employer's contribution base units for the high base year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:519 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The term &ldquo;3-year testing period&rdquo; means the period consisting of the plan year and the immediately preceding 2 plan years.</p>

A plan described in section 1383(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title (relating to the building and construction industry) may be amended, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, to provide that the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer not described in section 1383(b)(1)(A) of this title shall be determined in a manner different from that provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less the value as of the end of such year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers withdrawing before such year; multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may, by amendment, adopt any other alternative method for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of the method by the plan would not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation standard approaches for alternative methods, other than those set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, which a plan may adopt under subparagraph (A), for which the corporation may waive or modify the approval requirements of subparagraph (A). Any alternative method shall provide for the allocation of substantially all of a plan's unfunded vested benefits among employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Unless the corporation by regulation provides otherwise, a plan may be amended to provide that a period of more than 5 but not more than 10 plan years may be used for determining the numerator and denominator of any fraction which is used under any method authorized under this section for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The method of calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) of this section shall be the method for calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under a plan to which section 404(c) of title 26, or a continuation of such a plan, applies, unless the plan is amended to adopt another method authorized under subsection (b) or (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Sections 1384, 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), and 1405 of this title shall not apply with respect to the withdrawal of an employer from a plan described in paragraph (1) unless the plan is amended to provide that any of such sections apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction of liability of withdrawn employer in case of transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to withdrawal or partial withdrawal of employer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to an employer's withdrawal or partial withdrawal, the withdrawn employer's liability under this part shall be reduced in an amount equal to the value, as of the end of the last plan year ending on or before the date of the withdrawal, of the transferred unfunded vested benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Computations applicable in case of withdrawal following merger of multiemployer plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a withdrawal following a merger of multiemployer plans, subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section shall be applied in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation; except that, if a withdrawal occurs in the first plan year beginning after a merger of multiemployer plans, the determination under this section shall be made as if each of the multiemployer plans had remained separate plans.</p>

Actual payment shall commence in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The determination of the amortization period described in clause (i) shall be based on the assumptions used for the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case in which the amortization period described in subparagraph (A) exceeds 20 years, the employer's liability shall be limited to the first 20 annual payments determined under subparagraph (C).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the average annual number of contribution base units for the period of 3 consecutive plan years, during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs, in which the number of contribution base units for which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan is the highest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan during the 10 plan years ending with the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a)(1) of this title shall be deemed to occur on the last day of the first year of the 3-year testing period described in section 1385(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) A plan may be amended to provide that for any plan year ending before 1986 the amount of each annual payment shall be (in lieu of the amount determined under clause (i)) the average of the required employer contributions under the plan for the period of 3 consecutive plan years (during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending with the plan year preceding the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs) for which such required contributions were the highest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any plan year to which this clause applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) This clause shall not apply in the case of any withdrawal described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) If under a plan this clause applies to any plan year but does not apply to the next plan year, this clause shall not apply to any plan year after such next plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(V) For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;required contributions&rdquo; means, for any period, the amounts which the employer was obligated to contribute for such period (not taking into account any delinquent contribution for any other period).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each annual payment determined under paragraph (1)(C) shall be payable in 4 equal installments due quarterly, or at other intervals specified by plan rules. If a payment is not made when due, interest on the payment shall accrue from the due date until the date on which the payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The employer shall be entitled to prepay the outstanding amount of the unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments determined under paragraph (1)(C), plus accrued interest, if any, in whole or in part, without penalty. If the prepayment is made pursuant to a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a withdrawal described in paragraph (1)(D), the withdrawal liability of the employer shall not be limited to the amount of the prepayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the event of a default, a plan sponsor may require immediate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer's withdrawal liability, plus accrued interest on the total out<!-- PDFPage:531 -->standing liability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;default&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the failure of an employer to make, when due, any payment under this section, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), interest under this subsection shall be charged at rates based on prevailing market rates for comparable obligations, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A multiemployer plan may adopt rules for other terms and conditions for the satisfaction of an employer's withdrawal liability if such rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are consistent with this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In the case of a terminated multiemployer plan, an employer's obligation to make payments under this section ceases at the end of the plan year in which the assets of the plan (exclusive of withdrawal liability claims) are sufficient to meet all obligations of the plan, as determined by the corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is funded by amounts paid by the plans which participate in the fund, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) is administered by a Board of Trustees, and in the administration of the fund there is equal representation of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) trustees representing employees who are participants in plans which participate in the fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payments to plan; amount, criteria, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an employer withdraws from a plan which participates in a withdrawal liability payment fund, then, to the extent provided in the trust, the fund shall pay to that plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer's unattributable liability,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employer's withdrawal liability payments which would have been due but for section 1388, 1389, 1399, or 1405 of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the employer's withdrawal liability payments to the extent they are uncollectible.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The fund may provide for the payment of the employer's attributable liability if the fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provides for the payment of both the attributable and the unattributable liability of the employer in a single payment, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is subrogated to all rights of the plan against the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, the term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;attributable liability&rdquo; means the excess, if any, determined under the provisions of a plan not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the value of vested benefits accrued as a result of service with the employer, over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the value of plan assets attributed to the employer, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;unattributable liability&rdquo; means the excess of withdrawal liability over attributable liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The trust of a fund shall be maintained for the exclusive purpose of paying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any amount described in paragraph (1) and paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) reasonable and necessary administrative expenses in connection with the establishment and operation of the trust and the processing of claims against the fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amounts paid by a plan to a fund shall be deemed a reasonable expense of administering the plan under sections 1103(c)(1) and 1104(a)(1)(A)(ii) of this title, and the payments made by a fund to a participating plan shall be deemed services necessary for the operation of the plan within the meaning of section 1108(b)(2) of this title or within the meaning of section 4975(d)(2) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application of payments by plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) only amounts paid by the fund to a plan under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section shall be credited to withdrawal liability otherwise payable by the employer, unless the plan otherwise provides, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any amounts paid by the fund under subsection (c) of this section to a plan shall be treated by the plan as a payment of withdrawal liability to such plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of applying provisions relating to the funding standard accounts (and minimum contribution requirements), amounts paid from the plan to the fund shall be applied to reduce the amount treated as contributed to the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Subrogation of fund to rights of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the plan against the employer that has withdrawn from the plan for amounts paid by a fund to a plan under&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subsection (c)(1)(C) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Discharge of rights of fiduciary of fund; standards applicable, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, a fiduciary of the fund shall discharge the fiduciary's duties with respect to the fund in accordance with the standards for fiduciaries prescribed by this chapter (to the extent not inconsistent with the purposes of this section), and in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the fund insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this chapter (to the extent not inconsistent with the purposes of this section). The provisions of the preceding sentence shall supersede any and all State laws relating to fiduciaries insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to a fund to which this section applies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prohibition on payments from fund to plan where certain labor negotiations involve employer withdrawn or partially withdrawn from plan and continuity of labor organization representing employees continues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payments shall be made from a fund to a plan on the occasion of a withdrawal or partial withdrawal of an employer from such plan if the employees representing the withdrawn contribu<!-- PDFPage:534 -->tion base units continue, after such withdrawal, to be represented under section 159 of this title (or other applicable labor laws) in negotiations with such employer by the labor organization which represented such employees immediately preceding such withdrawal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Purchase of insurance by employer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit the purchase of insurance by an employer from any other person, to limit the circumstances under which such insurance would be payable, or to limit in any way the terms and conditions of such insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Promulgation of regulations for establishment and maintenance of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may provide by regulation rules not inconsistent with this section governing the establishment and maintenance of funds, but only to the extent necessary to carry out the purposes of this part (other than section 1402 of this title).</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of plan sponsor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless otherwise provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, a plan sponsor may not cause a multiemployer plan to merge with one or more multiemployer plans, or engage in a transfer of assets and liabilities to or from another multiemployer plan, unless such merger or transfer satisfies the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A merger or transfer satisfies the requirements of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in accordance with regulations of the corporation, the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan notifies the corporation of a merger with or transfer of plan assets or liabilities to another multiemployer plan at least 120 days before the effective date of the merger or transfer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit will be lower immediately after the effective date of the merger or transfer than the benefit immediately before that date;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of each of the affected plans has been performed during the plan year preceding the effective date of the merger or transfer, based upon the most recent data available as of the day before the start of that plan year, or other valuation of such assets and liabilities performed under such standards and procedures as the corporation may prescribe by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions not deemed violation of section 1106(a) or (b)(2) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The merger of multiemployer plans or the transfer of assets or liabilities between multiemployer plans, shall be deemed not to constitute a violation of the provisions of section 1106(a) of this title or section 1106(b)(2) of this title if the corporation determines that the merger or transfer otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nature of plan to which liabilities are transferred</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A transfer of assets or liabilities between, or a merger of, a multiemployer plan and a single-employer plan shall satisfy the requirements of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:536 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Accrued benefit of participant or beneficiary not lower immediately after effective date of transfer or merger</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No accrued benefit of a participant or beneficiary may be lower immediately after the effective date of a transfer or merger described in subsection (a) of this section than the benefit immediately before that date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability of multiemployer plan to corporation where single-employer plan terminates within 60 months after effective date of transfer; amount of liability, exemption, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a multiemployer plan which transfers liabilities to a single-employer plan shall be liable to the corporation if the single-employer plan terminates within 60 months after the effective date of the transfer. The amount of liability shall be the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of the plan asset insufficiency of the terminated single-employer plan, less 30 percent of the net worth of the employer who maintained the single-employer plan, determined in accordance with section 1362 or 1364 this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the value, on the effective date of the transfer, of the unfunded benefits transferred to the single-employer plan which are guaranteed under section 1322 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A multiemployer plan shall be liable to the corporation as provided in paragraph (1) unless, within 180 days after the corporation receives an application (together with such information as the corporation may reasonably require for purposes of such application) from the multiemployer plan sponsor for a determination under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the corporation determines that the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries and of the corporation are adequately protected, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) fails to make any determination regarding the adequacy with which such interests are protected with respect to such transfer of liabilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If, after the receipt of such application, the corporation requests from the plan sponsor additional information necessary for the determination, the running of the 180-day period shall be suspended from the date of such request until the receipt by the corporation of the additional information requested. The corporation may by regulation prescribe procedures and standards for the issuance of determinations under this paragraph. This paragraph shall not apply to any application submitted less than 180 days after September 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A multiemployer plan shall not be liable to the corporation as provided in paragraph (1) in the case of a transfer from the multiemployer plan to a single-employer plan of liabilities which accrued under a single-employer plan which merged with the multiemployer plan, if, the value of liabilities transferred to the single-employer plan does not exceed the value of the liabilities for benefits which accrued before the merger, and the value of the assets transferred to the single-employer plan is substantially equal to the value of the assets which would have been in the single-employer plan if the employer had maintained and funded it as a separate plan under which no benefits accrued after the date of the merger.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation may make equitable arrangements with multiemployer plans which are liable under this subsection for satisfaction of their liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee of benefits under single-employer plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Benefits under a single-employer plan to which liabilities are transferred in accordance with this section are guaranteed under section 1322 of this title to the extent provided in that section as of the effective date of the transfer and the plan is a successor plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfer of liabilities by multiemployer plan to single-employer plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a multiemployer plan may not transfer liabilities to a single-employer plan unless the plan sponsor of the plan to which the liabilities would be transferred agrees to the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a transfer described in subsection (c)(3) of this section, paragraph (1) of this subsection is satisfied by the advance agreement to the transfer by the employer who will be obligated to contribute to the single-employer plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional requirements by corporation for protection of interests of plan participants, beneficiaries and corporation; approval by corporation of transfer of assets or liabilities to single-employer plan from plan in reorganization; covered transfers in connection with termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may prescribe by regulation such additional requirements with respect to the transfer of assets or liabilities as may be necessary to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise determined by the corporation, a transfer of assets or liabilities to a single-employer plan from a plan in reorganization under section 1421 of this title is not effective unless the corporation approves such transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No transfer to which this section applies, in connection with a termination described in section 1341a(a)(2) of this title shall be effective unless the transfer meets such requirements as may be established by the corporation to prevent an increase in the risk of loss to the corporation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to transfer from old plan to new plan pursuant to employee participation in another multiemployer plan after certified change of representative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which an employer has completely or partially withdrawn from a multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;old plan&rdquo;) as a result of a certified change of collective bargaining representative occurring after September 25, 1980, if participants of the old plan who are employed by the employer will, as a result of that change, participate in another multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;new plan&rdquo;), the old plan shall transfer assets and liabilities to the new plan in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification by employer of plan sponsor of old plan; notification by plan sponsor of old plan of employer and plan sponsor of new plan; appeal by new plan to prevent transfer; further proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The employer shall notify the plan sponsor of the old plan of a change in multiemployer plan participation described in subsection (a) of this section no later than 30 days after the employer determines that the change will occur.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the employer of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the withdrawal,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the old plan's intent to transfer to the new plan the nonforfeitable benefits of the employees who are no longer working in covered service under the old plan as a result of the change of bargaining representative, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the amount of assets and liabilities which are to be transferred to the new plan, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:538 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the plan sponsor of the new plan of the benefits, assets, and liabilities which will be transferred to the new plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(B), the new plan may file an appeal with the corporation to prevent the transfer. The transfer shall not be made if the corporation determines that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer. Upon notification described in paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer fails to object to the transfer within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(A), or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities to the new plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduction of amount of withdrawal liability of employer upon transfer of appropriate amount of assets and liabilities by plan sponsor of old plan to new plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the plan sponsor of the old plan transfers the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities under this section to the new plan, then the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability (as determined under section 1381(b) of this title without regard to such transfer and this section) with respect to the old plan shall be reduced by the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the value of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer which were transferred by the plan sponsor of the old plan to the new plan, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of the assets transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Escrow payments by employer upon complete or partial withdrawal and prior to transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which there is a complete or partial withdrawal described in subsection (a) of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the new plan files an appeal with the corporation under subsection (b)(3) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the employer is required by section 1399 of this title to begin making payments of withdrawal liability before the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date on which the corporation finds that the new plan would not suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the last day of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the new plan files its appeal,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the employer shall make such payments into an escrow held by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the old plan. If the transfer is made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be returned to the employer. If the transfer is not made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be paid to the old plan and credited against the employer's withdrawal liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition on transfer of assets to new plan by plan sponsor of old plan; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the plan sponsor shall not transfer any assets to the new plan if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the old plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the transfer of assets would cause the old plan to go into reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which a transfer of assets from the old plan to the new plan is prohibited by paragraph (1), the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all nonforfeitable benefits described in subsection (b)(2) of this section, if the value of such benefits does not exceed the withdrawal liability of the employer with respect to such withdrawal, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such nonforfeitable benefits having a value equal to the withdrawal liability of the employer, if the value of such benefits exceeds the withdrawal liability of the employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agreement between plan sponsors of old plan and new plan to transfer in compliance with other statutory provisions; reduction of withdrawal liability of employer from old plan; amount of withdrawal liability of employer to new plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (e) of this section, the plan sponsors of the old plan and the new plan may agree to a transfer of assets and liabilities that complies with sections 1411 and 1414 of this title, rather than this section, except that the employer's liability with respect to the withdrawal from the old plan shall be reduced under subsection (c) of this section as if assets and liabilities had been transferred in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the employer withdraws from the new plan within 240 months after the effective date of a transfer of assets and liabilities described in this section, the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the new plan shall be the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the new plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount by which the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan was reduced under subsection (c) of this section, reduced by 5 percent for each 12-month period following the effective date of the transfer and ending before the date of the withdrawal from the new plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;appropriate amount of assets&rdquo; means the amount by which the value of the nonforfeitable benefits to be transferred exceeds the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan (determined under part 1 of this subtitle without regard to section 1391(e) of this title), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the sum of the minimum contribution requirement for such plan year (taking into account any overburden credit under section 1424(a) of this title) plus the plan's accumulated funding deficiency for the preceding plan year (determined under this section if the plan was in reorganization during such year or under section 1082(a) of this title if the plan was not in reorganization), over</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of amount; applicable factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in this section, for purposes of this part the minimum contribution requirement for a plan year in which a plan is in reorganization is an amount equal to the excess of&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the funding standard requirement for any plan year is an amount equal to the net charge to the funding standard account for such plan year (as defined in section 1421(b)(2) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a plan described in section 1396(b) of this title, if a plan amendment which increases benefits is adopted after January 1, 1980&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1424. Overburden credit against minimum contribution requirement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of overburden credit to determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the minimum contribution requirement under section 1423 of this title (before the application of section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title) the plan sponsor of a plan which is overburdened for the plan year shall apply an overburden credit against the plan's minimum contribution requirement for the plan year (determined without regard to section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title and without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of overburden status of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants under the plan in the base plan year exceeds the average of the number of active participants in the base plan year and the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of employer contributions under the plan equals or exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such rate for the preceding plan year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such rate for the plan year preceding the first year in which the plan is in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of overburden credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) one-half of the average guaranteed benefit paid for the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the overburden factor for the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year shall not exceed the amount of the minimum contribution requirement for such year (determined without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of overburden factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the overburden factor of a plan for the plan year is an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants for the base plan year, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average of the number of active participants for the base plan year and for each of the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions; determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;pay status participant&rdquo; means, with respect to a plan, a participant receiving retirement benefits under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The number of active participants for a plan year shall be the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of active employees who are participants in the plan and on whose behalf contributions are required to be made during the plan year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of active employees who are not participants in the plan but who are in an employment unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement which requires the employees&rsquo; employer to contribute to the plan, unless service in such employment unit was never covered under the plan or a predecessor thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total number of active employees attributed to employers who made payments to the plan for the plan year of withdrawal liability pursuant to part 1 of this subtitle, determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total amount of such payments, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount equal to the total contributions received by the plan during the plan year divided by the average number of active employees who were participants in the plan during the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulation provide alternative methods of determining active participants where (by reason of irregular employment, contributions on a unit basis, or otherwise) this paragraph does not yield a representative basis for determining the credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;average number&rdquo; means, with respect to pay status participants for a plan year, a number equal to one-half the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number with respect to the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number with respect to the plan as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The average guaranteed benefit paid is 12 times the average monthly pension payment guaranteed under section 1322a(c)(1) of this title determined under the provisions of the plan in effect at the beginning of the first plan year in which the plan is in reorganization and without regard to section 1322a(c)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The first year in which the plan is in reorganization is the first of a period of 1 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan has been in reorganization not taking into account any plan years the plan was in reorganization prior to any period of 3 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan was not in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Eligibility of plan for overburden credit for plan year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a plan is not eligible for an overburden credit for a plan year if the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the plan's current contribution base for the plan year was reduced, without a corresponding reduction in the plan's unfunded vested benefits attributable to pay status participants, as a result of a change in an agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (within the meaning of part 1 of this subtitle) does not impair a plan's eligibility for an overburden credit, unless the Secretary of the Treasury finds that a contribution base reduction described in paragraph (1) resulted from a transfer of liabilities to another plan in connection with the withdrawal.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:544 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Overburden credit where 2 or more multiemployer plans merge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if 2 or more multiemployer plans merge, the amount of the overburden credit which may be applied under this section with respect to the plan resulting from the merger for any of the 3 plan years ending after the effective date of the merger shall not exceed the sum of the used overburden credit for each of the merging plans for its last plan year ending before the effective date of the merger. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the used overburden credit is that portion of the credit which does not exceed the excess of the minimum contribution requirement (determined without regard to any overburden requirement under this section) over the employer contributions required under the plan.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amendment of multiemployer plan in reorganization to reduce or eliminate accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions ineligible for guarantee of corporation; adjustment of vested benefits charge to reflect plan amendment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, a multiemployer plan in reorganization may be amended in accordance with this section, to reduce or eliminate accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions which, under section 1322a(b) of this title, are not eligible for the corporation's guarantee. The preceding sentence shall only apply to accrued benefits under plan amendments (or plans) adopted after March 26, 1980, or under collective bargaining agreements entered into after March 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the minimum contribution requirement with respect to a plan for a plan year under section 1423(b) of this title, the vested benefits charge may be adjusted to reflect a plan amendment reducing benefits under this section or section 412(c)(8) of title 26, but only if the amendment is adopted and effective no later than 21/2 months after the end of the plan year, or within such extended period as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation under section 412(c)(10) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reduction of accrued benefits; notice by plan sponsors to plan participants and beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Accrued benefits may not be reduced under this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notice has been given, at least 6 months before the first day of the plan year in which the amendment reducing benefits is adopted, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) plan participants and beneficiaries,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) each employer who has an obligation to contribute (within the meaning of section 1392(a) of this title) under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) each employee organization which, for purposes of collective bargaining, represents plan participants employed by such an employer,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">that the plan is in reorganization and that, if contributions under the plan are not increased, accrued benefits under the plan will be reduced or an excise tax will be imposed on employers;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any category of accrued benefits is not reduced with respect to inactive participants to a greater extent proportionally than such category of accrued benefits is reduced with respect to active participants,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) benefits attributable to employer contributions other than accrued benefits and the rate of future benefit accruals are reduced at least to an extent equal to the reduction in accrued benefits of inactive participants, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in any case in which the accrued benefit of a participant or beneficiary is reduced by changing the benefit form or the requirements which the participant or beneficiary must satisfy to be entitled to the benefit, such reduction is not applicable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) any participant or beneficiary in pay status on the effective date of the amendment, or the beneficiary of such a participant, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) any participant who has attained normal retirement age, or who is within 5 years of attaining normal retirement age, on the effective date of the amendment, or the beneficiary of any such participant; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the rate of employer contributions for the plan year in which the amendment becomes effective and for all succeeding plan years in which the plan is in reorganization equals or exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the rate of employer contributions, calculated without regard to the amendment, for the plan year in which the amendment becomes effective, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the rate of employer contributions for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the amendment becomes effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan sponsors shall include in any notice required to be sent to plan participants and beneficiaries under paragraph (1) information as to the rights and remedies of plan participants and beneficiaries as well as how to contact the Department of Labor for further information and assistance where appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recoupment by plan of excess benefit payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan may not recoup a benefit payment which is in excess of the amount payable under the plan because of an amendment retroactively reducing accrued benefits under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amendment of plan to increase or restore accrued benefits previously reduced or rate of future benefit accruals; conditions, applicable factors, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A plan which has been amended to reduce accrued benefits under this section may be amended to increase or restore accrued benefits, <!-- PDFPage:545 -->or the rate of future benefit accruals, only if the plan is amended to restore levels of previously reduced accrued benefits of inactive participants and of participants who are within 5 years of attaining normal retirement age to at least the same extent as any such increase in accrued benefits or in the rate of future benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection, in the case of a plan which has been amended under this section to reduce accrued benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit increase to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit restoration to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is not thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan immediately before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a plan is amended to partially restore previously reduced accrued benefit levels, or the rate of future benefit accruals, the benefits of inactive participants shall be restored in at least the same proportions as other accrued benefits which are restored.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No benefit increase under a plan may take effect in a plan year in which an amendment reducing accrued benefits under the plan, in accordance with this section, is adopted or first becomes effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A plan is not required to make retroactive benefit payments with respect to that portion of an accrued benefit which was reduced and subsequently restored under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Inactive participant&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, &ldquo;inactive participant&rdquo; means a person not in covered service under the plan who is in pay status under the plan or who has a nonforfeitable benefit under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Promulgation of rules; contents, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules under which, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, accrued benefit reductions or benefit increases for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in contribution rates and other relevant factors reflecting differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Suspension of payments of benefits; conditions, amount, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, in any case in which benefit payments under an insolvent multiemployer plan exceed the resource benefit level, any such payments of benefits which are not basic benefits shall be suspended, in accordance with this section, to the extent necessary to reduce the sum of such payments and the payments of such basic benefits to the greater of the resource benefit level or the level of basic benefits, unless an alternative procedure is prescribed by the corporation under section 1322a(g)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of insolvency status for plan year; definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, for a plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a multiemployer plan is insolvent if the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the plan year, or if the plan is determined to be insolvent under subsection (d) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;resource benefit level&rdquo; means the level of monthly benefits determined under subsections (c)(1) and (3) and (d)(3) of this section to be the highest level which can be paid out of the plan's available resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;available resources&rdquo; means the plan's cash, marketable assets, contributions, withdrawal liability payments, and earnings, less reasonable administrative expenses and amounts owed for such plan year to the corporation under section 1431(b)(2) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) &ldquo;insolvency year&rdquo; means a plan year in which a plan is insolvent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination by plan sponsor of plan in reorganization of resource benefit level of plan for each insolvency year; uniform application of suspension of benefits; adjustments of benefit payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing the plan's resource benefit level for each insolvency year, based on the plan sponsor's reasonable projection of the plan's available resources and the benefits payable under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The suspension of benefit payments under this section shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, apply in substantially uniform proportions to the benefits of all persons in pay status (within the meaning of section 1421(b)(6) of this title) under the plan, except that the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules under which benefit suspensions for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in <!-- PDFPage:546 -->contribution rates and other relevant factors including differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if a plan sponsor determines in writing a resource benefit level for a plan year which is below the level of basic benefits, the payment of all benefits other than basic benefits must be suspended for that plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If, by the end of an insolvency year, the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan's available resources in that insolvency year could have supported benefit payments above the resource benefit level for that insolvency year, the plan sponsor shall distribute the excess resources to the participants and beneficiaries who received benefit payments from the plan in that insolvency year, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;excess resources&rdquo; means available resources above the amount necessary to support the resource benefit level, but no greater than the amount necessary to pay benefits for the plan year at the benefit levels under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, by the end of an insolvency year, any benefit has not been paid at the resource benefit level, amounts up to the resource benefit level which were unpaid shall be distributed to the participants and beneficiaries, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, to the extent possible taking into account the plan's total available resources in that insolvency year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Except as provided in paragraph (4) or (5), a plan is not required to make retroactive benefit payments with respect to that portion of a benefit which was suspended under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability and determinations respecting plan assets; time for determinations of resource benefit level and level of basic benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As of the end of the first plan year in which a plan is in reorganization, and at least every 3 plan years thereafter (unless the plan is no longer in reorganization), the plan sponsor shall compare the value of plan assets (determined in accordance with section 1423(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title) for that plan year with the total amount of benefit payments made under the plan for that plan year. Unless the plan sponsor determines that the value of plan assets exceeds 3 times the total amount of benefit payments, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 3 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, at any time, the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization reasonably determines, taking into account the plan's recent and anticipated financial experience, that the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the next plan year, the plan sponsor shall make such determination available to interested parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing for each insolvency year the resource benefit level and the level of basic benefits no later than 3 months before the insolvency year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice, etc., requirements of plan sponsor of plan in reorganization regarding insolvency and resource benefit levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization determines under subsection (d)(1) or (2) of this section that the plan may become insolvent (within the meaning of subsection (b)(1) of this section), the plan sponsor shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the corporation, the parties described in section 1422(a)(2) of this title, and the plan participants and beneficiaries of that determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inform the parties described in section 1422(a)(2) of this title and the plan participants and beneficiaries that if insolvency occurs certain benefit payments will be suspended, but that basic benefits will continue to be paid.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No later than 2 months before the first day of each insolvency year, the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the corporation, and the parties described in paragraph (1)(B) of the resource benefit level determined in writing for that insolvency year.</p>
