<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) because the plan is ceasing to offer any coverage in a geographic area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in the case of a plan that offers benefits through a network plan, there is no longer any individual enrolled through the employer who lives, resides, or works in the service area of the network plan and the plan applies this paragraph uniformly without regard to the claims experience of employers or any health status-related factor in relation to such individuals or their dependents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) for failure to meet the terms of an applicable collective bargaining agreement, to renew a collective bargaining or other agreement requiring or authorizing contributions to the plan, or to employ employees covered by such an agreement.</p>
