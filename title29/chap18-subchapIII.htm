<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Schedules for premium rates and bases for application; establishment, coverage, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation shall prescribe such schedules of premium rates and bases for the application of those rates as may be necessary to provide sufficient revenue to the fund for the corporation to carry out its functions under this subchapter. The premium rates charged by the corporation for any period shall be uniform for all plans, other than multiemployer plans, insured by the corporation with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title, and shall be uniform for all multiemployer plans with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation shall maintain separate schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title for single-employer plans,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title for multiemployer plans,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) nonbasic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title for single-employer plans,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) nonbasic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title for multiemployer plans, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) reimbursements of uncollectible withdrawal liability under section 1402 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation may revise such schedules whenever it determines that revised schedules are necessary. Except as provided in section 1322a(f) of this title, in order to place a revised schedule described in subparagraph (A) or (B) in effect, the corporation shall proceed in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section, and such schedule shall apply only to plan years beginning more than 30 days after the date on which a joint resolution approving such revised schedule is enacted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the annual premium rate payable to the corporation by all plans for basic benefits guaranteed under this subchapter is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of a single-employer plan, for plan years beginning after December 31, 1990, an amount equal to the sum of $19 plus the additional premium (if any) determined under subparagraph (E) for each individual who is a participant in such plan during the plan year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, for the plan year within which the date of enactment of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 falls, an amount for each individual who is a participant in such plan for such plan year equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) 50 cents, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months in such year ending on or before such date and the denominator of which is 12, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) $1.00, multiplied by a fraction equal to 1 minus the fraction determined under clause (i),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, for plan years beginning after September 26, 1980, an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) $1.40 for each participant, for the first, second, third, and fourth plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) $1.80 for each participant, for the fifth and sixth plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) $2.20 for each participant, for the seventh and eighth plan years, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) $2.60 for each participant, for the ninth plan year, and for each succeeding plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation the extent to which the rate described in subparagraph (A)(i) applies more than once for any plan year to an individual participating in more than one plan maintained by the same employer, and the corporation may prescribe regulations under which the rate described in subparagraph (A)(iii) will not apply to the same participant in any multiemployer plan more than once for any plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) If the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the amounts in any fund for basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:478 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the value of any assets held by the corporation for payment of basic benefits guaranteed for multiemployer plans,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is for any calendar year less than 2 times the amount of basic benefits guaranteed by the corporation under this subchapter for multiemployer plans which were paid out of any such fund or assets during the preceding calendar year, the annual premium rates under subparagraph (A) shall be increased to the next highest premium level necessary to insure that such sum will be at least 2 times greater than such amount during the following calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the board of directors of the corporation determines that an increase in the premium rates under subparagraph (A) is necessary to provide assistance to plans which are receiving assistance under section 1431 of this title and to plans the board finds are reasonably likely to require such assistance, the board may order such increase in the premium rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The maximum annual premium rate which may be established under this subparagraph is $2.60 for each participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply if the annual premium rate is increased to a level in excess of $2.60 per participant under any other provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Not later than 120 days before the date on which an increase under subparagraph (C)(ii) is to become effective, the corporation shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the determination described in subparagraph (C)(ii), the basis for the determination, the amount of the increase in the premium, and the anticipated increase in premium income that would result from the increase in the premium rate. The notice shall invite public comment, and shall provide for a public hearing if one is requested. Any such hearing shall be commenced not later than 60 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The board of directors shall review the hearing record established under clause (i) and shall, not later than 30 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective, determine (after consideration of the comments received) whether the amount of the increase should be changed and shall publish its determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The additional premium determined under this subparagraph with respect to any plan for any plan year shall be an amount equal to the amount determined under clause (ii) divided by the number of participants in such plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The amount determined under this clause for any plan year shall be an amount equal to $9.00 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of unfunded vested benefits under the plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For purposes of clause (ii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) Except as provided in subclause (II) or (III), the term &ldquo;unfunded vested benefits&rdquo; means the amount which would be the unfunded current liability (within the meaning of section 1082(d)(8)(A) of this title) if only vested benefits were taken into account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) The interest rate used in valuing vested benefits for purposes of subclause (I) shall be equal to the applicable percentage of the annual yield on 30-year Treasury securities for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins. For purposes of this subclause, the applicable percentage is 80 percent for plan years beginning before July 1, 1997, 85 percent for plan years beginning after June 30, 1997, and before the 1st plan year to which the first tables prescribed under section 1082(d)(7)(C)(ii)(II) of this title apply, and 100 percent for such 1st plan year and subsequent plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) In the case of any plan year for which the applicable percentage under subclause (II) is 100 percent, the value of the plan's assets used in determining unfunded current liability under subclause (I) shall be their fair market value.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) In the case of plan years beginning after December 31, 2001, and before January 1, 2004, subclause (II) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;100 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;85 percent&rdquo;. Subclause (III) shall be applied for such years without regard to the preceding sentence. Any reference to this clause or this subparagraph by any other sections or subsections (other than sections 1305, 1310, 1311, and 1343 of this title) shall be treated as a reference to this clause or this subparagraph without regard to this subclause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) In the case of plan years beginning after December 31, 2003, and before January 1, 2006, the annual yield taken into account under subclause (II) shall be the annual rate of interest determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on amounts invested conservatively in long-term investment grade corporate bonds for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine such rate of interest on the basis of 2 or more indices that are selected periodically by the Secretary of the Treasury and that are in the top 3 quality levels available. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make the permissible range, and the indices and methodology used to determine the rate, publicly available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) No premium shall be determined under this subparagraph for any plan year if, as of the close of the preceding plan year, contributions to the plan for the preceding plan year were not less than the full funding limitation for the preceding plan year under section 412(c)(7) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation may prescribe, subject to the enactment of a joint resolution in accordance with this section or section 1322a(f) of this title, alternative schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for basic benefits guaranteed by it under sections 1322 and 1322a of this title based, in whole or in part, on the risks insured by the corporation in each plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In carrying out its authority under paragraph (1) to establish schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for nonbasic benefits guaranteed under sections 1322 and 1322a of this title the premium rates charged by the corporation for any period for nonbasic benefits guaranteed shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:479 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) be uniform by category of nonbasic benefits guaranteed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) be based on the risks insured in each category, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) reflect the experience of the corporation (including experience which may be reasonably anticipated) in guaranteeing such benefits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), premium rates charged to any multiemployer plan by the corporation for any period for supplemental guarantees under section 1322a(g)(2) of this title may reflect any reasonable considerations which the corporation determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) In carrying out its authority under paragraph (1) to establish premium rates and bases for basic benefits guaranteed under section 1322 of this title with respect to single-employer plans, the corporation shall establish such rates and bases in coverage schedules in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may establish annual premiums for single-employer plans composed of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a charge based on a rate applicable to the excess, if any, of the present value of the basic benefits of the plan which are guaranteed over the value of the assets of the plan, not in excess of 0.1 percent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an additional charge based on a rate applicable to the present value of the basic benefits of the plan which are guaranteed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The rate for the additional charge referred to in clause (ii) shall be set by the corporation for every year at a level which the corporation estimates will yield total revenue approximately equal to the total revenue to be derived by the corporation from the charges referred to in clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The corporation may establish annual premiums for single-employer plans based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the number of participants in a plan, but such premium rates shall not exceed the rates described in paragraph (3),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) unfunded basic benefits guaranteed under this subchapter, but such premium rates shall not exceed the limitations applicable to charges referred to in subparagraph (B)(i), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) total guaranteed basic benefits, but such premium rates shall not exceed the rates for additional charges referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the corporation uses two or more of the rate bases described in this subparagraph, the premium rates shall be designed to produce approximately equal amounts of aggregate premium revenue from each of the rate bases used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the corporation shall by regulation define the terms &ldquo;value of assets&rdquo; and &ldquo;present value of the benefits of the plan which are guaranteed&rdquo; in a manner consistent with the purposes of this subchapter and the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Revised schedule; Congressional procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to place a revised schedule (other than a schedule described in subsection (a)(2)(C), (D), or (E) of this section) in effect, the corporation shall transmit the proposed schedule, its proposed effective date, and the reasons for its proposal to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives, and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The succeeding paragraphs of this subsection are enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of resolutions described in paragraph (3). They shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; means only a joint resolution, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &ldquo;The proposed revised schedule transmitted to Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; is hereby approved.&rdquo;, the blank space therein being filled with the date on which the corporation's message proposing the rate was delivered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A resolution shall be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If a committee to which has been referred a resolution has not reported it before the expiration of 10 calendar days after its introduction, it shall then (but not before) be in order to move to discharge the committee from further consideration of that resolution, or to discharge the committee from further consideration of any other resolution with respect to the proposed adjustment which has been referred to the committee. The motion to discharge may be made only by a person favoring the resolution, shall be highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution with respect to the same proposed rate), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed, nor may another motion to discharge the committee be made with respect to any other resolution with respect to the same proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) When a committee has reported, or has been discharged from further consideration of a resolution, it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An <!-- PDFPage:480 -->amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. Debate on the resolution shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Motions to postpone, made with respect to the discharge from committee, or the consideration of, a resolution and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business shall be decided without debate. Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution shall be decided without debate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rates for plans for basic benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in subsection (a)(3) of this section, and subject to paragraph (2), the rate for all plans for basic benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to plan years ending after September 2, 1974, is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) with respect to each plan year beginning after December 31, 1977, and before January 1, 1986, an amount equal to $2.60 for each individual who was a participant in such plan during the plan year, and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1306_1_target" name="1306_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) with respect to each plan year beginning after December 31, 1985, and before January 1, 1988, an amount equal to $8.50 for each individual who was a participant in such plan during the plan year, and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1307. Payment of premiums</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Premiums payable when due; accrual; waiver or reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The designated payor of each plan shall pay the premiums imposed by the corporation under this subchapter with respect to that plan when they are due. Premiums under this subchapter are payable at the time, and on an estimated, advance, or other basis, as determined by the corporation. Premiums imposed by this subchapter on September 2, 1974 (applicable to that portion of any plan year during which such date occurs) are due within 30 days after such date. Premiums imposed by this subchapter on the first plan year commencing after September 2, 1974, are due within 30 days after such plan year commences. Premiums shall continue to accrue until a plan's assets are distributed pursuant to a termination procedure, or until a trustee is appointed pursuant to section 1342 of this title, whichever is earlier. The corporation may waive or reduce premiums for a multiemployer plan for any plan year during which such plan receives financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title, except that any amount so waived or reduced shall be treated as financial assistance under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Late payment charge; waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any basic benefit premium is not paid when it is due the corporation is authorized to assess a late payment charge of not more than 100 percent of the premium payment which was not timely paid. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any payment of premium made within 60 days after the date on which payment is due, if before such date, the designated payor obtains a waiver from the corporation based upon a showing of substantial hardship arising from the timely payment of the premium. The corporation is authorized to grant a waiver under this subsection upon application made by the designated payor, but the corporation may not grant a waiver if it appears that the designated payor will be unable to pay the premium within 60 days after the date on which it is due. If any premium is not paid by the last date prescribed for a payment, interest on the amount of such premium at the rate imposed under section 6601(a) of title 26 (relating to interest on underpayment, nonpayment, or extensions of time for payment of tax) shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Civil action to recover premium penalty and interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any designated payor fails to pay a premium when due, the corporation is authorized to bring a civil action in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the plan assets are located, the plan is administered, or in which a defendant resides or is found for the recovery of the amount of the premium penalty, and interest, and process may be served in any <!-- PDFPage:483 -->other district. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over actions brought under this subsection by the corporation without regard to the amount in controversy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basic benefits guarantee not stopped by designated payor's failure to pay premiums when due</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation shall not cease to guarantee basic benefits on account of the failure of a designated payor to pay any premium when due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Designated payor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;designated payor&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the contributing sponsor or plan administrator in the case of a single-employer plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan administrator in the case of a multiemployer plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the contributing sponsor of any single-employer plan is a member of a controlled group, each member of such group shall be jointly and severally liable for any premiums required to be paid by such contributing sponsor. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (<em>o</em>) of section 414 of title 26.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1322. Single-employer plan benefits guaranteed</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nonforfeitable benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations contained in subsection (b) of this section, the corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a single-employer plan which terminates at a time when this subchapter applies to it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (7)&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:486 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) no benefits provided by a plan which has been in effect for less than 60 months at the time the plan terminates shall be guaranteed under this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any increase in the amount of benefits under a plan resulting from a plan amendment which was made, or became effective, whichever is later, within 60 months before the date on which the plan terminates shall be disregarded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the time a successor plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) has been in effect includes the time a previously established plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) was in effect. For purposes of determining what benefits are guaranteed under this section in the case of a plan to which section 1321 of this title does not apply on September 3, 1974, the 60-month period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed beginning on the first date on which such section does apply to the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of monthly benefits described in subsection (a) of this section provided by a plan, which are guaranteed under this section with respect to a participant, shall not have an actuarial value which exceeds the actuarial value of a monthly benefit in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 65 equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) his average monthly gross income from his employer during the 5 consecutive calendar year period (or, if less, during the number of calendar years in such period in which he actively participates in the plan) during which his gross income from that employer was greater than during any other such period with that employer determined by dividing 1/12 of the sum of all such gross income by the number of such calendar years in which he had such gross income, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $750 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 430]) in effect at the time the plan terminates and the denominator of which is such contribution and benefit base in effect in calendar year 1974.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to non-basic benefits. The maximum guaranteed monthly benefit shall not be reduced solely on account of the age of a participant in the case of a benefit payable by reason of disability that occurred on or before the termination date, if the participant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that the Social Security Administration has determined that the participant satisfies the definition of disability under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.; 1381 et seq.], and the regulations thereunder. If a benefit payable by reason of disability is converted to an early or normal retirement benefit for reasons other than a change in the health of the participant, such early or normal retirement benefit shall be treated as a continuation of the benefit payable by reason of disability and this subparagraph shall continue to apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The actuarial value of a benefit, for purposes of this subsection, shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of paragraph (3)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; means &ldquo;earned income&rdquo; within the meaning of section 911(b) of title 26 (determined without regard to any community property laws),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a participant in a plan under which contributions are made by more than one employer, amounts received as gross income from any employer under that plan shall be aggregated with amounts received from any other employer under that plan during the same period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any non-basic benefit shall be disregarded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;substantial owner&rdquo; means an individual who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a partnership, is a partner who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest in such partnership, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of a corporation, owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent in value of either the voting stock of that corporation or all the stock of that corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of clause (iii) the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) of title 26 shall apply (determined without regard to section 1563(e)(3)(C)). For purposes of this subchapter an individual is also treated as a substantial owner with respect to a plan if, at any time within the 60 months preceding the date on which the determination is made, he was a substantial owner under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a participant in a plan under which benefits have not been increased by reason of any plan amendments and who is covered by the plan as a substantial owner, the amount of benefits guaranteed under this section shall not exceed the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a fraction (not to exceed 1) the numerator of which is the number of years the substantial owner was an active participant in the plan, and the denominator of which is 30, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of the substantial owner's monthly benefits guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section (as limited under paragraph (3) of this subsection).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a participant in a plan, other than a plan described in subparagraph (B), who is covered by the plan as a substantial owner, the amount of the benefit guaranteed under this section shall, under regulations prescribed by the corporation, treat each benefit increase attributable to a plan amendment as if it were provided under a new plan. The benefits guaranteed under this section with respect to all such amendments shall not exceed the amount which would be determined under subparagraph (B) if subparagraph (B) applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury issues notice that he has determined that any trust which is a part of a plan does not meet the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26, or that the plan does not meet the requirements of sec<!-- PDFPage:487 -->tion 404(a)(2) of title 26, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous. This subparagraph does not apply if the Secretary subsequently issues a notice that such trust meets the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26 or that the plan meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26 and if the Secretary determines that the trust or plan has taken action necessary to meet such requirements during the period between the issuance of the notice referred to in the preceding sentence and the issuance of the notice referred to in this sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which an amendment of the plan is adopted which causes the Secretary of the Treasury to determine that any trust under the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26 or that the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous. This subparagraph shall not apply if the amendment is revoked as of the date it was first effective or amended to comply with such requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Benefits described in paragraph (1) are guaranteed only to the extent of the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 20 percent of the amount which, but for the fact that the plan or amendment has not been in effect for 60 months or more, would be guaranteed under this section, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits, but further determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities on the basis of the information made available to it, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan's assets in the manner described in subsection (b)(3) of this section, make certification to <!-- PDFPage:496 -->the corporation that the distribution has occurred, and take such actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Termination of a multiemployer plan under this section occurs as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the adoption after September 26, 1980, of a plan amendment which provides that participants will receive no credit for any purpose under the plan for service with any employer after the date specified by such amendment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, within the meaning of section 1383 of this title, or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the adoption of an amendment to the plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Date of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section is the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the amendment is adopted, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the amendment takes effect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section is the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the last employer withdraws, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day of the first plan year for which no employer contributions were required under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duties of plan sponsor of amended plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (f)(1) of this section, the plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) limit the payment of benefits to benefits which are nonforfeitable under the plan as of the date of the termination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity, unless the plan assets are distributed in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Duties of plan sponsor of nonoperative plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall reduce benefits and suspend benefit payments in accordance with section 1441 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of contribution of employer under amended plan for each plan year subsequent to plan termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a plan which terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section, the rate of an employer's contributions under the plan for each plan year beginning on or after the plan termination date shall equal or exceed the highest rate of employer contributions at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan in the 5 preceding plan years ending on or before the plan termination date, unless the corporation approves a reduction in the rate based on a finding that the plan is or soon will be fully funded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of benefits; reporting requirements for terminated plans and rules and standards for administration of such plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a terminated plan may authorize the payment other than in the form of an annuity of a participant's entire nonforfeitable benefit attributable to employer contributions, other than a death benefit, if the value of <!-- PDFPage:501 -->the entire nonforfeitable benefit does not exceed $1,750. The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation's risk of loss with respect to the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to prevent unreasonable loss to the corporation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1342. Institution of termination proceedings by the corporation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under section 412 of title 26, or has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that a notice of deficiency under section 6212 of title 26 has been mailed with respect to the tax imposed under section 4971(a) of title 26,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the reportable event described in section 1343(c)(7) of this title has occurred, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c) of this section). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointment of trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) of this section to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) of this section ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which section 1341a(d) of this title applies, unless such appointment would be adverse to the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries in the aggregate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjudication that plan must be terminated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the preceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree himself. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. If the corporation and the plan admin<!-- PDFPage:502 -->istrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) of this section and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agreement between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3) of this section. Whenever a trustee appointed under this subchapter is operating a plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1342_1_target" name="1342_1">1</a></sup> In the case of a proceeding initiated under this section, the plan administrator shall provide the corporation, upon the request of the corporation, the information described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of section 1341(c)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Powers of trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section shall have the power&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to do any act authorized by the plan or this subchapter to be done by the plan administrator or any trustee of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to require the transfer of all (or any part) of the assets and records of the plan to himself as trustee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to invest any assets of the plan which he holds in accordance with the provisions of the plan, regulations of the corporation, and applicable rules of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) to limit payment of benefits under the plan to basic benefits or to continue payment of some or all of the benefits which were being paid prior to his appointment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) in the case of a multiemployer plan, to reduce benefits or suspend benefit payments under the plan, give appropriate notices, amend the plan, and perform other acts required or authorized by subtitle (E) of this subchapter to be performed by the plan sponsor or administrator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) to do such other acts as he deems necessary to continue operation of the plan without increasing the potential liability of the corporation, if such acts may be done under the provisions of the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) to require the plan sponsor, the plan administrator, any contributing or withdrawn employer, and any employee organization representing plan participants to furnish any information with respect to the plan which the trustee may reasonably need in order to administer the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the court to which application is made under subsection (c) of this section dismisses the application with prejudice, or if the corporation fails to apply for a decree under subsection (c) of this section, within 30 days after the date on which the trustee is appointed under subsection (b) of this section, the trustee shall transfer all assets and records of the plan held by him to the plan administrator within 3 business days after such dismissal or the expiration of such 30-day period, and shall not be liable to the plan or any other person for his acts as trustee except for willful misconduct, or for conduct in violation of the provisions of part 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter (except as provided in subsection (d)(1)(A)(v) of this section). The 30-day period referred to in this subparagraph may be extended as provided by agreement between the plan administrator and the corporation or by court order obtained by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the court to which an application is made under subsection (c) of this section issues the decree requested in such application, in addition to the powers described in subparagraph (A), the trustee shall have the power&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to pay benefits under the plan in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to collect for the plan any amounts due the plan, including but not limited to the power to collect from the persons obligated to meet the requirements of section 1082 of this title or the terms of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to receive any payment made by the corporation to the plan under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) to commence, prosecute, or defend on behalf of the plan any suit or proceeding involving the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) to issue, publish, or file such notices, statements, and reports as may be required by the corporation or any order of the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) to liquidate the plan assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) to recover payments under section 1345(a) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) to do such other acts as may be necessary to comply with this subchapter or any order of the court and to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable after his appointment, the trustee shall give notice to interested parties of the institution of proceedings under this subchapter to determine whether the plan should be terminated or to terminate the plan, whichever is applicable. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;interested party&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan administrator,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) each participant in the plan and each beneficiary of a deceased participant,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) each employer who may be subject to liability under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) each employer who is or may be liable to the plan under section&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1342_2_target" name="1342_2">2</a></sup> part 1 of subtitle E of this subchapter,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) each employer who has an obligation to contribute, within the meaning of section 1392(a) of this title, under a multiemployer plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) each employee organization which, for purposes of collective bargaining, represents plan participants employed by an employer described in subparagraph (C), (D), or (E).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, or as may be otherwise ordered by the court, a trustee appointed under this section shall be subject to the same duties as those of a trustee under section 704 of title 11, and shall be, with respect to the plan, a <!-- PDFPage:503 -->fiduciary within the meaning of paragraph (21) of section 1002 of this title and under section 4975(e) of title 26 (except to the extent that the provisions of this subchapter are inconsistent with the requirements applicable under part 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter and of such section 4975).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Filing of application notwithstanding pendency of other proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An application by the corporation under this section may be filed notwithstanding the pendency in the same or any other court of any bankruptcy, mortgage foreclosure, or equity receivership proceeding, or any proceeding to reorganize, conserve, or liquidate such plan or its property, or any proceeding to enforce a lien against property of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exclusive jurisdiction; stay of other proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of an application for the appointment of a trustee or the issuance of a decree under this section, the court to which an application is made shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the plan involved and its property wherever located with the powers, to the extent consistent with the purposes of this section, of a court of the United States having jurisdiction over cases under chapter 11 of title 11. Pending an adjudication under subsection (c) of this section such court shall stay, and upon appointment by it of a trustee, as provided in this section such court shall continue the stay of, any pending mortgage foreclosure, equity receivership, or other proceeding to reorganize, conserve, or liquidate the plan or its property and any other suit against any receiver, conservator, or trustee of the plan or its property. Pending such adjudication and upon the appointment by it of such trustee, the court may stay any proceeding to enforce a lien against property of the plan or any other suit against the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An action under this subsection may be brought in the judicial district where the plan administrator resides or does business or where any asset of the plan is situated.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1344. Allocation of assets</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Order of priority of participants and beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the termination of a single-employer plan, the plan administrator shall allocate the assets of the plan (available to provide benefits) among the participants and beneficiaries of the plan in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) First, to that portion of each individual's accrued benefit which is derived from the participant's contributions to the plan which were not mandatory contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Second, to that portion of each individual's accrued benefit which is derived from the participant's mandatory contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Third, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of the benefit of a participant or beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date of the plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a participant's or beneficiary's benefit (other than a benefit described in subparagraph (A)) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such 3-year period if the participant had retired prior to the beginning of the 3-year period and if his benefits had commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the plan) as of the beginning of such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the lowest benefit in pay status during a 3-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status for such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Fourth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to all other benefits (if any) of individuals under the plan guaranteed under this subchapter (determined without regard to section 1322b(a) of this title), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the additional benefits (if any) which would be determined under subparagraph (A) if section 1322(b)(5) of this title did not apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, section 1321 of this title shall be applied without regard to subsection (c) thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Fifth, to all other nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Sixth, to all other benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment of allocations; reallocations; mandatory contributions; establishment of subclasses and categories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The amount allocated under any paragraph of subsection (a) of this section with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of subsection (a) of this section (other than paragraphs (5) and (6)) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph (B), the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in such paragraph (5) on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph (5) under the plan as in effect at the beginning of the 5-year period ending on the date of plan termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allocated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the allocation made pursuant to <!-- PDFPage:507 -->this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) of title 26 then, if required to prevent the disqualification of the plan (or any trust under the plan) under section 401(a) or 403(a) of title 26, the assets allocated under subsections (a)(4)(B), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section shall be reallocated to the extent necessary to avoid such discrimination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;mandatory contributions&rdquo; means amounts contributed to the plan by a participant which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions. For this purpose, the total amount of mandatory contributions of a participant is the amount of such contributions reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts paid or distributed to him under the plan before its termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A plan may establish subclasses and categories within the classes described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) of this section in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increase or decrease in value of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring during the period beginning on the later of (1) the date a trustee is appointed under section 1342(b) of this title or (2) the date on which the plan is terminated is to be allocated between the plan and the corporation in the manner determined by the court (in the case of a court-appointed trustee) or as agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator in any other case. Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring after the date on which the plan is terminated shall be credited to, or suffered by, the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Distribution of residual assets; restrictions on reversions pursuant to recently amended plans; assets attributable to employee contributions; calculation of remaining assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (3), any residual assets of a single-employer plan may be distributed to the employer if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all liabilities of the plan to participants and their beneficiaries have been satisfied,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the plan provides for such a distribution in these circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In determining the extent to which a plan provides for the distribution of plan assets to the employer for purposes of paragraph (1)(C), any such provision, and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer, shall not be treated as effective before the end of the fifth calendar year following the date of the adoption of such provision or amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction described in section 1058 of this title occurs, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply separately with respect to the amount of any assets transferred in such transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;employer&rdquo; includes any member of the controlled group of which the employer is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m) or (<em>o</em>) of section 414 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before any distribution from a plan pursuant to paragraph (1), if any assets of the plan attributable to employee contributions remain after satisfaction of all liabilities described in subsection (a) of this section, such remaining assets shall be equitably distributed to the participants who made such contributions or their beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the portion of the remaining assets which are attributable to employee contributions shall be an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the market value of the total remaining assets, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the present value of all portions of the accrued benefits with respect to participants which are derived from participants&rsquo; mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2) of this section), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the present value of all benefits with respect to which assets are allocated under paragraphs (2) through (6) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, each person who is, as of the termination date&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a participant under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an individual who has received, during the 3-year period ending with the termination date, a distribution from the plan of such individual's entire nonforfeitable benefit in the form of a single sum distribution in accordance with section 1053(e) of this title or in the form of irrevocable commitments purchased by the plan from an insurer to provide such nonforfeitable benefit,</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Single-employer plans with two or more contributing sponsors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the plan administrator of a single-employer plan which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall notify the corporation of the withdrawal during a plan year of a substantial employer for such plan year from the plan, within 60 days after such withdrawal, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) request that the corporation determine the liability of all persons with respect to the withdrawal of the substantial employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, determine whether there is liability resulting from the withdrawal of the substantial employer and notify the liable persons of such liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, any one or more contributing sponsors who withdraw, during a plan year for which they constitute a substantial employer, from a single-employer plan which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, shall, upon notification of such contributing sponsors by the corporation as provided by subsection (a) of this section, be liable, together with the members of their controlled groups, to the corporation in accordance with the provisions of section 1362 of this title and this section. The amount of liability shall be computed on the basis of an amount determined by the corporation to be the amount described in section 1362 of this title for the entire plan, as if the plan had been terminated by the corporation on the date of the withdrawal referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by such contributing sponsors for the last 5 years ending prior to the withdrawal, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the denominator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by all contributing sponsors for such last 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition to and in lieu of the manner prescribed in the preceding sentence, the corporation may also determine such liability on any other equitable basis prescribed by the corporation in regulations. Any amount collected by the corporation under this subsection shall be held in escrow subject to disposition in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Bond in lieu of payment of liability; 5-year termination period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In lieu of payment of a contributing sponsor's liability under this section, the contributing sponsor may be required to furnish a bond to the corporation in an amount not exceeding 150 percent of his liability to insure payment of his liability under this section. The bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury under sections 9304&ndash;9308 of title 31. Any such bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the plan is not terminated under section 1341(c) or 1342 of this title within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the liability is abated and any payment held in escrow shall be refunded without interest (or the bond cancelled) in accordance with bylaws or rules prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the plan terminates under section 1341(c) or 1342 of this title within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the corporation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) demand payment or realize on the bond and hold such amount in escrow for the benefit of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) treat any escrowed payments under this section as if they were plan assets and apply them in a manner consistent with this subtitle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) refund any amount to the contributing sponsor which is not required to meet any ob<!-- PDFPage:515 -->ligation of the corporation with respect to the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternate appropriate procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this subsection apply in the case of a withdrawal described in subsection (a) of this section, and the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply, if the corporation determines that the procedure provided for under this subsection is consistent with the purposes of this section and section 1364 of this title and is more appropriate in the particular case. Upon a showing by the plan administrator of the plan that the withdrawal from the plan by one or more contributing sponsors has resulted, or will result, in a significant reduction in the amount of aggregate contributions to or under the plan, the corporation may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require the plan fund to be equitably allocated between those participants no longer working in covered service under the plan as a result of the withdrawal, and those participants who remain in covered service under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) treat that portion of the plan funds allocable under paragraph (1) to participants no longer in covered service as a plan terminated under section 1342 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) treat that portion of the plan fund allocable to participants remaining in covered service as a separate plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Indemnity agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation is authorized to waive the application of the provisions of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section whenever it determines that there is an indemnity agreement in effect among contributing sponsors under the plan which is adequate to satisfy the purposes of this section and of section 1364 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person liable to the corporation under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title neglects or refuses to pay, after demand, the amount of such liability (including interest), there shall be a lien in favor of the corporation in the amount of such liability (including interest) upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person, except that such lien may not be in an amount in excess of 30 percent of the collective net worth of all persons described in section 1362(a) of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1368_1_target" name="1368_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Term of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The lien imposed by subsection (a) of this section arises on the date of termination of a plan, and continues until the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided under this section, the priority of a lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section shall be determined in the same manner as under section 6323 of title 26 (as in effect on April 7, 1986). Such section 6323 shall be applied for purposes of this section by disregarding subsection (g)(4) and by substituting&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;lien imposed by section 4068 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1368]&rdquo; for &ldquo;lien imposed by section 6321&rdquo; each place it appears in subsections (a), (b), (c)(1), (c)(4)(B), (d), (e), and (h)(5);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;the corporation&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo; in subsections (a) and (b)(9)(C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) &ldquo;the payment of the amount on which the section 4068(a) lien is based&rdquo; for &ldquo;the collection of any tax under this title&rdquo; in subsection (b)(3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) &ldquo;a person whose property is subject to the lien&rdquo; for &ldquo;the taxpayer&rdquo; in subsections (b)(8), (c)(2)(A)(i) (the first place it appears), (c)(2)(A)(ii), (c)(2)(B), (c)(4)(B), and (c)(4)(C) (in the matter preceding clause (i));</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) &ldquo;such person&rdquo; for &ldquo;the taxpayer&rdquo; in subsections (c)(2)(A)(i) (the second place it appears) and (c)(4)(C)(ii);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) &ldquo;payment of the loan value of the amount on which the lien is based is made to the corporation&rdquo; for &ldquo;satisfaction of a levy pursuant to section 6332(b)&rdquo; in subsection (b)(9)(C);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) &ldquo;section 4068(a) lien&rdquo; for &ldquo;tax lien&rdquo; each place it appears in subsections (c)(1), (c)(2)(A), (c)(2)(B), (c)(3)(B)(iii), (c)(4)(B), (d), and (h)(5); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) &ldquo;the date on which the lien is first filed&rdquo; for &ldquo;the date of the assessment of the tax&rdquo; in subsection (g)(3)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a case under title 11 or in insolvency proceedings, the lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated in the same manner as a tax due and owing to the United States for purposes of title 11 or section 3713 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of applying section 6323(a) of title 26 to determine the priority between the lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section and a Federal tax lien, each lien shall be treated as a judgment lien arising as of the time notice of such lien is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, notice of the lien imposed by subsection (a) of this section shall be filed in the same manner as under section 6323(f) and (g) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil action; limitation period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, the corporation may bring civil action in a district court of the United States to enforce the lien of the corporation under this section with respect to such liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of the liable person, or in which he has any right, title, or interest to the payment of such liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The liability imposed by section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title may be collected by a proceeding in court if the proceeding is commenced within 6 years after the date upon which the plan was terminated or prior to the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the corporation and the liable person before the expiration of such 6-year period. The period of limitations provided under this paragraph shall be suspended for the period the assets of the liable person are in the control or custody of any court of the United States, or of any State, or of the District of Columbia, and for 6 months thereafter, and for any period during which the liable person is outside the United States if such period of absence is for a continuous period of at least 6 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Release or subordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation determines that release of the lien or subordination of the lien to any other creditor of the liable person would not adversely affect the collection of the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, or that the amount realizable by the corporation from the property to which the lien attaches will ultimately be increased by such release or subordination, and that the ultimate collection of the liability will be facilitated by such release or subordination, the corporation may issue a certificate of release or subordination of the lien with respect to such property, or any part thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination shall be determined as provided in section 1362(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;pre-tax profits&rdquo; has the meaning provided in section 1362(d)(2) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who is with respect to a single-employer plan a fiduciary, contributing sponsor, member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group, participant, or beneficiary, and is adversely affected by an act or practice of any party (other than the corporation) in violation of any provision of section 1341, 1342, 1362, 1363, 1364, or 1369 of this title, or who is an employee organization representing such a participant or beneficiary so adversely affected for purposes of collective bargaining with respect to such plan, may bring an action&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Status of plan as party to action and with respect to legal process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A single-employer plan may be sued under this section as an entity. Service of summons, subpoena, or other legal process of a court upon a trustee or an administrator of a single-employer plan in such trustee's or administrator's capacity as such shall constitute service upon the plan. If a plan has not designated in the summary plan description of the plan an individual as agent for the service of legal process, service upon any contributing sponsor of the plan shall constitute such service. Any money judgment under this section against a single-employer plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in such person's individual capacity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction and venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this section. Such actions may be brought in the district where the plan is administered, where the violation took place, or where a defendant resides or may be found, and process may be served in any other district where a defendant resides or may be found. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to grant the relief provided for in subsection (a) of this section in any action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Right of corporation to intervene</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A copy of the complaint or notice of appeal in any action under this section shall be served upon the corporation by certified mail. The corporation shall have the right in its discretion to intervene in any action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Awards of costs and expenses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any action brought under this section, the court in its discretion may award all or a portion of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action, including reasonable attorney's fees, to any party who prevails or substantially prevails in such action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exemption for plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, no plan shall be required in any action to pay any costs and expenses (including attorney's fees).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), an action under this section may not be brought after the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 6 years after the date on which the cause of action arose, or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, a complete withdrawal from a multiemployer plan occurs when an employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Building and construction industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the building and construction industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) substantially all the employees with respect to whom the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan perform work in the building and construction industry, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is amended to provide that this subsection applies to employers described in this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) resumes such work within 5 years after the date on which the obligation to contribute under the plan ceases, and does not renew the obligation at the time of the resumption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a plan terminated by mass withdrawal (within the meaning of section 1341a(a)(2) of this title), paragraph (2) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3 years&rdquo; for &ldquo;5 years&rdquo; in subparagraph (B)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Entertainment industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the entertainment industry, primarily on a temporary or project-by-project basis, if the plan primarily covers employees in the entertainment industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in subsection (b)(2) of this section applied by substituting &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for &ldquo;collective bargaining agreement&rdquo; in subparagraph (B)(i) thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;entertainment industry&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) theater, motion picture (except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation), radio, television, sound or visual recording, music, and dance, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other entertainment activities as the corporation may determine to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation may by regulation exclude a group or class of employers described in the <!-- PDFPage:523 -->preceding sentence from the application of this subsection if the corporation determines that such exclusion is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to protect the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prevent a significant risk of loss to the corporation with respect to the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A plan may be amended to provide that this subsection shall not apply to a group or class of employers under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has an obligation to contribute under a plan described in paragraph (2) primarily for work described in such paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) does not continue to perform work within the jurisdiction of the plan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A plan is described in this paragraph if substantially all of the contributions required under the plan are made by employers primarily engaged in the long and short haul trucking industry, the household goods moving industry, or the public warehousing industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the corporation determines that the plan has suffered substantial damage to its contribution base as a result of such cessation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employer fails to furnish a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to 50 percent of the withdrawal liability of the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If, after an employer furnishes a bond or escrow to a plan under paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the corporation determines that the cessation of the employer's obligation to contribute under the plan (considered together with any cessations by other employers), or cessation of covered operations under the plan, has resulted in substantial damage to the contribution base of the plan, the employer shall be treated as having withdrawn from the plan on the date on which the obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased, and such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan. The corporation shall not make a determination under this paragraph more than 60 months after the date on which such obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the corporation determines that the employer has no further liability under the plan either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) because it determines that the contribution base of the plan has not suffered substantial damage as a result of the cessation of the employer's obligation to contribute or cessation of covered operations (considered together with any cessation of contribution obligation, or of covered operations, with respect to other employers), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) because it may not make a determination under paragraph (4) because of the last sentence thereof,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the bond shall be cancelled or the escrow refunded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a limitation on the amount of the withdrawal liability of any employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Date of complete withdrawal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the date of a complete withdrawal is the date of the cessation of the obligation to contribute or the cessation of covered operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special liability withdrawal rules for industries other than construction and entertainment industries; procedures applicable to amend plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may prescribe regulations under which plans in industries other than the construction or entertainment industries may be amended to provide for special withdrawal liability rules similar to the rules described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Regulations under paragraph (1) shall permit use of special withdrawal liability rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) only in industries (or portions thereof) in which, as determined by the corporation, the characteristics that would make use of such rules appropriate are clearly shown, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) only if the corporation determines, in each instance in which special withdrawal liability rules are permitted, that use of such rules will not pose a significant risk to the corporation under this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Complete or partial withdrawal not occurring as a result of sale and subsequent cessation of covered operations or cessation of obligation to contribute to covered operations; continuation of liability of seller</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;seller&rdquo;) under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm's-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo;), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the purchaser provides to the plan for a period of 5 plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the sale of assets, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial insti<!-- PDFPage:524 -->tution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the average annual contribution required to be made by the seller with respect to the operations under the plan for the 3 plan years preceding the plan year in which the sale of the employer's assets occurs, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the annual contribution that the seller was required to make with respect to the operations under the plan for the last plan year before the plan year in which the sale of the assets occurs,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">which bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan, or fails to make a contribution to the plan when due, at any time during the first 5 plan years beginning after the sale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract for sale provides that, if the purchaser withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations, during such first 5 plan years, the seller is secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the plan with respect to the operations (but for this section) if the liability of the purchaser with respect to the plan is not paid.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the purchaser&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year beginning after the sale, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) fails to make any withdrawal liability payment when due,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If all, or substantially all, of the seller's assets are distributed, or if the seller is liquidated before the end of the 5 plan year period described in paragraph (1)(C), then the seller shall provide a bond or amount in escrow equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability the seller would have had but for this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If only a portion of the seller's assets are distributed during such period, then a bond or escrow shall be required, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The liability of the party furnishing a bond or escrow under this subsection shall be reduced, upon payment of the bond or escrow to the plan, by the amount thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liability of purchaser</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purposes of this part, the liability of the purchaser shall be determined as if the purchaser had been required to contribute to the plan in the year of the sale and the 4 plan years preceding the sale the amount the seller was required to contribute for such operations for such 5 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the plan is in reorganization in the plan year in which the sale of assets occurs, the purchaser shall furnish a bond or escrow in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may by regulation vary the standards in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section if the variance would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Before it promulgates such regulations, the corporation may grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements of such subparagraphs if the particular case warrants it. Before granting such an individual or class variance or exemption, the corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the variance or exemption,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall afford interested persons an opportunity to present their views.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan with respect to work performed at one or more but fewer than all of its facilities, but continues to perform work at the facility of the type for which the obligation to contribute ceased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a cessation of obligations under a collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered to have occurred solely because, with respect to the same plan, one agreement that requires contributions to the plan has been substituted for another agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Retail food industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of a plan in which a majority of the covered employees are employed in the retail food industry, the plan may be amended to provide that this section shall be applied with respect to such plan&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any conditions; criteria; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may prescribe regulations providing for the reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any conditions with respect to which the corporation determines that reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may by amendment adopt rules for the reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any other conditions, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of such rules by the plan is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendment of multiemployer plan for determination respecting amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan; factors determining computation of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A multiemployer plan, other than a plan which primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, may be amended to provide that the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from the plan is an amount determined under paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, rather than under subsection (b) or (d) of this section. A plan described in section 1383(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title (relating to the building and construction industry) may be amended, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, to provide that the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer not described in section 1383(b)(1)(A) of this title shall be determined in a manner different from that provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, reduced as if those obligations were being fully amortized in level annual installments over 15 years beginning with the first plan year ending on or after such date; multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made for the last 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, by all employers who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after September 25, 1980, and who had not withdrawn from the plan before such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the sum of the value as of such date of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected, with respect to employers withdrawing before such plan year, and that portion of the amount determined under subparagraph (B)(i) which is allocable to employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and who also had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after September 25, 1980; multiplied by</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the plan by the employer for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, increased by the amount of any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer who withdrew from the plan under this part during those plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less the value as of the end of such year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which <!-- PDFPage:531 -->can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers withdrawing before such year; multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, increased by any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed to the plan during those plan years by employers who withdrew from the plan under this section during those plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants&rsquo; service with the employer (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the employer's proportional share of any unfunded vested benefits which are not attributable to service with the employer or other employers who are obligated to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The plan's unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants&rsquo; service with the employer is the amount equal to the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan which are attributable to participants&rsquo; service with such employer (determined under plan rules not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation) decreased by the share of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) which is allocated to the employer as provided under subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The value of plan assets determined under this subparagraph is the value of plan assets allocated to nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, which is determined by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the value of the plan assets as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the value of nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with such employers, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The share of plan assets, determined under subparagraph (C), which is allocated to the employer shall be determined in accordance with one of the following methods which shall be adopted by the plan by amendment:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by multiplying the value of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the value of the nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with the employer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the value of the nonforfeitable benefits which are attributable to service with all employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by multiplying the value of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions (accumulated with interest) which have been made to the plan by the employer for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and all preceding plan years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions (accumulated with interest) which have been made to the plan (for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and all preceding plan years) by all employers who have an obligation to contribute to the plan for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) by multiplying the value of plan assets under subparagraph (C) by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the amount determined under clause (ii)(I) of this subparagraph, less the sum of benefit payments (accumulated with interest) made to participants (and their beneficiaries) for the plan years described in such clause (ii)(I) which are attributable to service with the employer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the amount determined under clause (ii)(II) of this subparagraph, reduced by the sum of benefit payments (accumulated with interest) made to participants (and their beneficiaries) for the plan years described in such clause (ii)(II) which are attributable to service with respect to the employers described in such clause (ii)(II).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The amount of the plan's unfunded vested benefits for a plan year preceding the plan year in which an employer withdraws, which is not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which such employer withdraws, is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the value of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan at the end of such plan year, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan at the end of such plan year which are attributable to participants&rsquo; service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan for such plan year; reduced by</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the value of the plan assets as of the end of such plan year, reduced by</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the value of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected with respect to employers withdrawing before the year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The employer's proportional share described in subparagraph (A)(ii) for a plan year is the amount determined under subparagraph (E) for the employer, but not in excess of an amount which bears the same ratio to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (E) for all employers under the plan as the amount determined under subparagraph (C) for the employer bears to the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraph (C) for all employers under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) The corporation may prescribe by regulation other methods which a plan may adopt for allocating assets to determine the amount of the unfunded vested benefits attributable to service with the employer and to determine the employer's share of unfunded vested benefits not attributable to service with employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year in which the employer withdraws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may, by amendment, adopt any other alternative method for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of the method by the plan would not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation standard approaches for alternative methods, other than those set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, which a plan may adopt under subparagraph (A), for which the corporation may waive or modify the approval requirements of subparagraph (A). Any alternative method shall provide for the allocation of substantially all of a plan's unfunded vested benefits among employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Unless the corporation by regulation provides otherwise, a plan may be amended to provide that a period of more than 5 but not more than 10 plan years may be used for determining the numerator and denominator of any fraction which is used under any method authorized under this section for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Method of calculating allocable share of employer of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) of this section; applicability of certain statutory provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The method of calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) of this section shall be the method for calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under a plan to which section 404(c) of title 26, or a continuation of such a plan, applies, unless the plan is amended to adopt another method authorized under subsection (b) or (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Sections 1384, 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), and 1405 of this title shall not apply with respect to the withdrawal of an employer from a plan described in paragraph (1) unless the plan is amended to provide that any of such sections apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction of liability of withdrawn employer in case of transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to withdrawal or partial withdrawal of employer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a transfer of liabilities to another plan incident to an employer's withdrawal or partial withdrawal, the withdrawn employer's liability under this part shall be reduced in an amount equal to the value, as of the end of the last plan year ending on or before the date of the withdrawal, of the transferred unfunded vested benefits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Computations applicable in case of withdrawal following merger of multiemployer plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a withdrawal following a merger of multiemployer plans, subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section shall be applied in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation; except that, if a withdrawal occurs in the first plan year beginning after a merger of multiemployer plans, the determination under this section shall be made as if each of the multiemployer plans had remained separate plans.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the average annual number of contribution base units for the period of 3 consecutive plan years, during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs, in which the number of contribution base units for which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan is the highest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan during the 10 plan years ending with the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a)(1) of this title shall be deemed to occur on the last day of the first year of the 3-year testing period described in section 1385(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) A plan may be amended to provide that for any plan year ending before 1986 the amount of each annual payment shall be (in lieu of the amount determined under clause (i)) the average of the required employer contributions under the plan for the period of 3 consecutive plan years (during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending with the plan year preceding the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs) for which such required contributions were the highest.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:536 --><p class="statutory-body">(II) Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any plan year to which this clause applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) This clause shall not apply in the case of any withdrawal described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) If under a plan this clause applies to any plan year but does not apply to the next plan year, this clause shall not apply to any plan year after such next plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(V) For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;required contributions&rdquo; means, for any period, the amounts which the employer was obligated to contribute for such period (not taking into account any delinquent contribution for any other period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) A plan may be amended to provide that for the first plan year ending on or after September 26, 1980, the number &ldquo;5&rdquo; shall be substituted for the number &ldquo;10&rdquo; each place it appears in clause (i) or clause (ii) (whichever is appropriate).

<p class="statutory-body-block">Withdrawal by an employer from a plan, during a period of 3 consecutive plan years within which substantially all the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan withdraw, shall be presumed to be a withdrawal pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Withdrawal liability shall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor under subsection (b)(1) of this section beginning no later than 60 days after the date of the demand notwithstanding any request for review or appeal of determinations of the amount of such liability or of the schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each annual payment determined under paragraph (1)(C) shall be payable in 4 equal installments due quarterly, or at other intervals specified by plan rules. If a payment is not made when due, interest on the payment shall accrue from the due date until the date on which the payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The employer shall be entitled to prepay the outstanding amount of the unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments determined under paragraph (1)(C), plus accrued interest, if any, in whole or in part, without penalty. If the prepayment is made pursuant to a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a withdrawal described in paragraph (1)(D), the withdrawal liability of the employer shall not be limited to the amount of the prepayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the event of a default, a plan sponsor may require immediate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer's withdrawal liability, plus accrued interest on the total outstanding liability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;default&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the failure of an employer to make, when due, any payment under this section, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), interest under this subsection shall be charged at rates based on prevailing market rates for comparable obligations, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A multiemployer plan may adopt rules for other terms and conditions for the satisfaction of an employer's withdrawal liability if such rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are consistent with this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In the case of a terminated multiemployer plan, an employer's obligation to make payments under this section ceases at the end of the plan year in which the assets of the plan (exclusive of withdrawal liability claims) are sufficient to meet all obligations of the plan, as determined by the corporation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Arbitration proceedings; matters subject to arbitration, procedures applicable, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any dispute between an employer and the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan concerning a determination made under sections 1381 through 1399 of this title shall be resolved through arbitration. Either party may initiate the arbitration proceeding within a 60-day period after the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date of notification to the employer under section 1399(b)(2)(B) of this title, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The parties may jointly initiate arbitration within the 180-day period after the date of the plan sponsor's demand under section 1399(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An arbitration proceeding under this section shall be conducted in accordance with fair and equitable procedures to be promulgated by the corporation. The plan sponsor may purchase insurance to cover potential liability of the arbitrator. If the parties have not provided for the costs of the arbitration, including arbitrator's fees, by agreement, the arbitrator shall assess such fees. The arbitrator may also award reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For purposes of any proceeding under this section, any determination made by a plan sponsor under sections 1381 through 1399 of this title and section 1405 of this title is presumed correct unless the party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the determination was unreasonable or clearly erroneous.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of the determination of a plan's unfunded vested benefits for a plan year, the determination is presumed correct unless a party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance of evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the actuarial assumptions and methods used in the determination were, in the aggregate, unreasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the plan's actuary made a significant error in applying the actuarial assumptions or methods.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Alternative collection proceedings; civil action subsequent to arbitration award; conduct of arbitration proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If no arbitration proceeding has been initiated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the amounts demanded by the plan sponsor under section 1399(b)(1) of this title shall be due and owing on the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor. The plan sponsor may bring an action in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction for collection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon completion of the arbitration proceedings in favor of one of the parties, any party thereto may bring an action, no later than 30 days after the issuance of an arbitrator's award, in an appropriate United States district court in accordance with section 1451 of this title to enforce, vacate, or modify the arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any arbitration proceedings under this section shall, to the extent consistent with this subchapter, be conducted in the same manner, subject to the same limitations, carried out with the same powers (including subpena power), and enforced in United States courts as an arbitration proceeding carried out under title 9.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Presumption respecting finding of fact by arbitrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, there shall be a presumption, rebuttable only by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that the findings of fact made by the arbitrator were correct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments by employer prior and subsequent to determination by arbitrator; adjustments; failure of employer to make payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments shall be made by an employer in accordance with the determinations made under this part until the arbitrator issues a final decision with respect to the determination submitted for arbitration, with any necessary adjustments in subsequent payments for overpayments or underpayments arising out of the decision of the arbitrator with respect to the determination. If the employer fails to make timely payment in accordance with such final decision, the employer shall be treated as being delinquent in the making of a contribution required under the plan (within the meaning of section 1145 of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Furnishing of information by plan sponsor to employer respecting computation of withdrawal liability of employer; fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any employer requests in writing that the plan sponsor make available to the employer <!-- PDFPage:538 -->general information necessary for the employer to compute its withdrawal liability with respect to the plan (other than information which is unique to that employer), the plan sponsor shall furnish the information to the employer without charge. If any employer requests in writing that the plan sponsor make an estimate of such employer's potential withdrawal liability with respect to the plan or to provide information unique to that employer, the plan sponsor may require the employer to pay the reasonable cost of making such estimate or providing such information.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability of multiemployer plan to corporation where single-employer plan terminates within 60 months after effective date of transfer; amount of liability, exemption, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a multiemployer plan which transfers liabil<!-- PDFPage:542 -->ities to a single-employer plan shall be liable to the corporation if the single-employer plan terminates within 60 months after the effective date of the transfer. The amount of liability shall be the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of the plan asset insufficiency of the terminated single-employer plan, less 30 percent of the net worth of the employer who maintained the single-employer plan, determined in accordance with section 1362 or 1364 this title, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the corporation determines that the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries and of the corporation are adequately protected, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If, after the receipt of such application, the corporation requests from the plan sponsor additional information necessary for the determination, the running of the 180-day period shall be suspended from the date of such request until the receipt by the corporation of the additional information requested.

This paragraph shall not apply to any application submitted less than 180 days after September 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A multiemployer plan shall not be liable to the corporation as provided in paragraph (1) in the case of a transfer from the multiemployer plan to a single-employer plan of liabilities which accrued under a single-employer plan which merged with the multiemployer plan, if, the value of liabilities transferred to the single-employer plan does not exceed the value of the liabilities for benefits which accrued before the merger, and the value of the assets transferred to the single-employer plan is substantially equal to the value of the assets which would have been in the single-employer plan if the employer had maintained and funded it as a separate plan under which no benefits accrued after the date of the merger.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation may make equitable arrangements with multiemployer plans which are liable under this subsection for satisfaction of their liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee of benefits under single-employer plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise determined by the corporation, a transfer of assets or liabilities to a single-employer plan from a plan in reorganization under section 1421 of this title is not effective unless the corporation approves such transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No transfer to which this section applies, in connection with a termination described in section 1341a(a)(2) of this title shall be effective unless the transfer meets such requirements as may be established by the corporation to prevent an increase in the risk of loss to the corporation.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to transfer from old plan to new plan pursuant to employee participation in another multiemployer plan after certified change of representative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which an employer has completely or partially withdrawn from a multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;old plan&rdquo;) as a result of a certified change of collective bargaining representative occurring after September 25, 1980, if participants of the old plan who are employed by the employer will, as a result of that change, participate in another multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;new plan&rdquo;), the old plan shall transfer assets and liabilities to the new plan in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification by employer of plan sponsor of old plan; notification by plan sponsor of old plan of employer and plan sponsor of new plan; appeal by new plan to prevent transfer; further proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The employer shall notify the plan sponsor of the old plan of a change in multiemployer plan participation described in subsection (a) of this section no later than 30 days after the employer determines that the change will occur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan sponsor of the old plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the employer of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the withdrawal,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the old plan's intent to transfer to the new plan the nonforfeitable benefits of the employees who are no longer working in covered service under the old plan as a result of the change of bargaining representative, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the amount of assets and liabilities which are to be transferred to the new plan, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the plan sponsor of the new plan of the benefits, assets, and liabilities which will be transferred to the new plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(B), the new plan may file an appeal with the corporation to prevent the transfer. The transfer shall not be made if the corporation determines that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer. Upon notification described in paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer fails to object to the transfer within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the new plan either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) fails to file such an appeal, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the corporation, pursuant to such an appeal, fails to find that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer described in the notice under <!-- PDFPage:544 -->paragraph (2)(B) within 180 days after the date on which the appeal is filed,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities to the new plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduction of amount of withdrawal liability of employer upon transfer of appropriate amount of assets and liabilities by plan sponsor of old plan to new plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the plan sponsor of the old plan transfers the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities under this section to the new plan, then the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability (as determined under section 1381(b) of this title without regard to such transfer and this section) with respect to the old plan shall be reduced by the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the value of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer which were transferred by the plan sponsor of the old plan to the new plan, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of the assets transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Escrow payments by employer upon complete or partial withdrawal and prior to transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which there is a complete or partial withdrawal described in subsection (a) of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the new plan files an appeal with the corporation under subsection (b)(3) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the employer is required by section 1399 of this title to begin making payments of withdrawal liability before the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date on which the corporation finds that the new plan would not suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the last day of the 180-day period beginning on the date on which the new plan files its appeal,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the employer shall make such payments into an escrow held by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the old plan. If the transfer is made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be returned to the employer. If the transfer is not made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be paid to the old plan and credited against the employer's withdrawal liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition on transfer of assets to new plan by plan sponsor of old plan; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the plan sponsor shall not transfer any assets to the new plan if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the old plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the transfer of assets would cause the old plan to go into reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which a transfer of assets from the old plan to the new plan is prohibited by paragraph (1), the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all nonforfeitable benefits described in subsection (b)(2) of this section, if the value of such benefits does not exceed the withdrawal liability of the employer with respect to such withdrawal, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such nonforfeitable benefits having a value equal to the withdrawal liability of the employer, if the value of such benefits exceeds the withdrawal liability of the employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agreement between plan sponsors of old plan and new plan to transfer in compliance with other statutory provisions; reduction of withdrawal liability of employer from old plan; amount of withdrawal liability of employer to new plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (e) of this section, the plan sponsors of the old plan and the new plan may agree to a transfer of assets and liabilities that complies with sections 1411 and 1414 of this title, rather than this section, except that the employer's liability with respect to the withdrawal from the old plan shall be reduced under subsection (c) of this section as if assets and liabilities had been transferred in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the employer withdraws from the new plan within 240 months after the effective date of a transfer of assets and liabilities described in this section, the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the new plan shall be the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the new plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount by which the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan was reduced under subsection (c) of this section, reduced by 5 percent for each 12-month period following the effective date of the transfer and ending before the date of the withdrawal from the new plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;appropriate amount of assets&rdquo; means the amount by which the value of the nonforfeitable benefits to be transferred exceeds the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan (determined under part 1 of this subtitle without regard to section 1391(e) of this title), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the minimum contribution requirement under section 1423 of this title (before the application of section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title) the plan sponsor of a plan which is overburdened for the plan year shall apply an overburden credit against the plan's minimum contribution requirement for the plan year (determined without regard to section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title and without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of overburden status of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants under the plan in the base plan year exceeds the average of the number of active participants in the base plan year and the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, a multiemployer plan in reorganization may be amended in accordance with this section, to reduce or eliminate accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions which, under section 1322a(b) of this title, are not eligible for the corporation's guarantee.

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, in any case in which benefit payments under an insolvent multiemployer plan exceed the resource benefit level, any such payments of benefits which are not basic benefits shall be suspended, in accordance with this section, to the extent necessary to reduce the sum of such payments and the payments of such basic benefits to the greater of the resource benefit level or the level of basic benefits, unless an alternative procedure is prescribed by the corporation under section 1322a(g)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of insolvency status for plan year; definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, for a plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a multiemployer plan is insolvent if the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the plan year, or if the plan is determined to be insolvent under subsection (d) of this section;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination by plan sponsor of plan in reorganization of resource benefit level of plan for each insolvency year; uniform application of suspension of benefits; adjustments of benefit payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing the plan's resource benefit level for each insolvency year, based on the plan sponsor's reasonable projection of the plan's available resources and the benefits payable under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The suspension of benefit payments under this section shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, apply in substantially uniform proportions to the benefits of all persons in pay status (within the meaning of section 1421(b)(6) of this title) under the plan, except that the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules under which benefit suspensions for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in contribution rates and other relevant factors including differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if a plan sponsor determines in writing a resource benefit level for a plan year which is below the level of basic benefits, the payment of all benefits other than basic benefits must be suspended for that plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If, by the end of an insolvency year, the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan's available resources in that insolvency year could have supported benefit payments above the resource benefit level for that insolvency year, the plan sponsor shall distribute the excess resources to the participants and beneficiaries who received benefit payments from the plan in that insolvency year, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;excess resources&rdquo; means available resources above the amount necessary to support the resource benefit level, but no greater than the amount necessary to pay benefits for the plan year at the benefit levels under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) As of the end of the first plan year in which a plan is in reorganization, and at least every 3 plan years thereafter (unless the plan is no longer in reorganization), the plan sponsor shall compare the value of plan assets (determined in accordance with section 1423(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title) for that plan year with the total amount of benefit payments made under the plan for that plan year. Unless the plan sponsor determines that the value of plan assets exceeds 3 times the total amount of benefit payments, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 3 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, at any time, the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization reasonably determines, taking into account the plan's recent and anticipated financial experience, that the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the next plan year, the plan sponsor shall make such determination available to interested parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing for each insolvency year the resource benefit level and the level of basic benefits no later than 3 months before the insolvency year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice, etc., requirements of plan sponsor of plan in reorganization regarding insolvency and resource benefit levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization determines under subsection (d)(1) or (2) of this section that the plan may become insolvent (within the meaning of subsection (b)(1) of this section), the plan sponsor shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the corporation, the parties described in section 1422(a)(2) of this title, and the plan participants and beneficiaries of that determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inform the parties described in section 1422(a)(2) of this title and the plan participants and beneficiaries that if insolvency occurs certain benefit payments will be suspended, but that basic benefits will continue to be paid.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No later than 2 months before the first day of each insolvency year, the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the corporation, and the parties described in paragraph (1)(B) of the resource benefit level determined in writing for that insolvency year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the plan sponsor anticipates that the resource benefit level for an insolvency year may not exceed the level of basic benefits, the plan sponsor shall notify the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notice required by this subsection shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, except that notice to the Secretary of the Treasury shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The corporation may prescribe a time other than the time prescribed by this section for the making of a determination or the filing of a notice under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Financial assistance from corporation; conditions and criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the plan sponsor of an insolvent plan, for which the resource benefit level is above the level of basic benefits, anticipates that, for any month in an insolvency year, the plan will not have funds sufficient to pay basic benefits, the plan sponsor may apply for financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A plan sponsor who has determined a resource benefit level for an insolvency year which is below the level of basic benefits shall apply for financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The provisions of this subchapter take effect on September 2, 1974.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, the corporation shall pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to any plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which is not a multiemployer plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which terminates after June 30, 1974, and before September 2, 1974,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to which section 1321 of this title would apply if that section were effective beginning on July 1, 1974, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) with respect to which a notice is filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than 10 days after September 2, 1974, except that, for reasonable cause shown, such notice may be filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than October 31, 1974, stating that the plan is a plan described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a plan described in the preceding sentence unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this subchapter or for the purpose of avoiding the liability which might be imposed under subtitle D of this subchapter if the plan terminated on or after September 2, 1974. The provisions of subtitle D of this subchapter do not apply in the case of such a plan which terminates before September 2, 1974. For purposes of determining whether a plan is a plan described in paragraph (2), the provisions of section 1348 of this title shall not apply, but the corporation shall make the determination on the basis of the date on which benefits ceased to accrue or on any other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation may, in its discretion, pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates after September 2, 1974 and before August 1, 1980, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan was maintained during the 60 months immediately preceding the date on which the plan terminates, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the corporation determines that the payment by the corporation of benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to that plan will not jeopardize the payments the corporation anticipates it may be required to make in connection with benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to multiemployer plans which terminate after July 31, 1980.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any provision of section 1321 or 1322 of this title which would prevent such payments, the corporation, in carrying out its authority under paragraph (2), may pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan described in paragraph (2) in any case in which those benefits would otherwise not be payable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan has been in effect for at least 5 years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan has been in substantial compliance with the funding requirements for a qualified plan with respect to the employees and former employees in those employment units on the basis of which the participating employers have contributed to the plan for the preceding 5 years, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the participating employers and employee organization or organizations had no reasonable recourse other than termination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the corporation determines, under paragraph (2) or (3), that it will pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980, the corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may establish requirements for the continuation of payments which commenced before January 2, 1974, with respect to retired participants under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may not, notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, make payments with respect to any participant under such a plan who, on January 1, 1974, was receiving payment of retirement benefits, in excess of the amounts and rates payable with respect to such participant on that date,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may not make any payments with respect to benefits guaranteed under this subchapter in connection with such a plan which are derived, directly or indirectly, from amounts borrowed under section 1305(c) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall review from time to time payments made under the authority granted to it by paragraphs (2) and (3), and reduce or terminate <!-- PDFPage:556 -->such payments to the extent necessary to avoid jeopardizing the ability of the corporation to make payments of benefits guaranteed under this subchapter in connection with multiemployer plans which terminate after July 31, 1980, without increasing premium rates for such plans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, guaranteed benefits payable by the corporation pursuant to its discretionary authority under this section shall continue to be paid at the level guaranteed under section 1322 of this title, without regard to any limitation on payment under subparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection (c)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the amendments to this chapter made by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 shall take effect on September 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in this paragraph, part 1 of subtitle E of this subchapter, relating to withdrawal liability, takes effect on September 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of determining withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of this subchapter, an employer who has withdrawn from a plan shall be considered to have withdrawn from a multiemployer plan if, at the time of the withdrawal, the plan was a multiemployer plan as defined in section 1301(a)(3) of this title as in effect at the time of the withdrawal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Sections 1421 through 1426 of this title, relating to multiemployer plan reorganization, shall take effect, with respect to each plan, on the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the last collective bargaining agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan, which was in effect on September 26, 1980, expires, without regard to extensions agreed to on or after September 26, 1980, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 3 years after September 26, 1980.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Section 1415 of this title shall take effect on September 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) In the event that before September 26, 1980, the corporation has determined that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an employer has withdrawn from a multiemployer plan under section 1363 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employer is liable to the corporation under such section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the corporation shall retain the amount of liability paid to it or furnished in the form of a bond and shall pay such liability to the plan in the event the plan terminates in accordance with section 1341a(a)(2) of this title before the earlier of September 26, 1985, or the day after the 5-year period commencing on the date of such withdrawal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which the plan is not so terminated within the period described in paragraph (1), the liability of the employer is abated and any payment held in escrow shall be refunded without interest to the employer or the employer's bond shall be cancelled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) In any case in which an employer or employers withdrew from a multiemployer plan before the effective date of part 1 of subtitle E of this subchapter, the corporation may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) apply section 1363(d) of this title, as in effect before the amendments made by the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, to such plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) assess liability against the withdrawn employer with respect to the resulting terminated plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) guarantee benefits under the terminated plan under section 1322 of this title, as in effect before such amendments, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) if necessary, enforce such action through suit brought under section 1303 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation shall use the revolving fund used by the corporation with respect to basic benefits guaranteed under section 1322a of this title in guaranteeing benefits under a terminated plan described in this subsection.</p>
