<p class="statutory-body">(3) To the extent that a State workers&rsquo; compensation law is applicable, workers&rsquo; compensation benefits in accordance with such law shall be available with respect to injuries suffered by participants. To the extent that such law is not applicable, each recipient of funds under this chapter shall secure insurance coverage for injuries suffered by such participants, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) existing contracts for services; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) existing collective bargaining agreements, unless the employer and the labor organization concur in writing with respect to any elements of the proposed activities which affect such agreement, or either such party fails to respond to written notification requesting its concurrence within 30 days of receipt thereof.</p>
