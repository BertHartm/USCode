<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Avoidance of accumulated funding deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Every employee pension benefit plan subject to this part shall satisfy the minimum funding standard (or the alternative minimum funding standard under section 1085 of this title) for any plan year to which this part applies. A plan to which this part applies shall have satisfied the minimum funding standard for such plan for a plan year if as of the end of such plan year the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;accumulated funding deficiency&rdquo; means for any plan the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which this part applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any plan year in which a multiemployer plan is in reorganization, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan shall be determined under section 1423 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding standard account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each plan to which this part applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:378 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this part applies, over a period of 40 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of a plan which comes into existence after January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this part applies, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net loss (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1083(c) of this title) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under paragraph (3)(D), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 20 years the contributions which would be required to be made under the plan but for the provisions of subsection (c)(7)(A)(i)(I) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1083(c) of this title) for the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standard, the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may be off set against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Interest.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Required change of interest rate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of determining a plan's current liability and for purposes of determining a plan's required contribution under subsection (d) of this section for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If any rate of interest used under the plan to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall establish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Permissible range</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subclause (II), the term &ldquo;permissible range&rdquo; means a rate of interest which is not more than 10 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1082_1_target" name="1082_1">1</a></sup> weighted average of the rates of interest on 30-year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) <cap-smallcap>Secretarial authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, the Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under subclause (I).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:379 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Assumptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (c)(3)(A)(i) of this section, the interest rate used under the plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In the case of a plan which, immediately before September 26, 1980, was a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of section 1002(37) of this title as in effect immediately before such date)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(iii), or (3)(B)(i) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) or (3)(B)(ii) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 20 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 3 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from a plan amendment adopted before such date, shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 2 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from the changing of a group of participants from one benefit level to another benefit level under a schedule of plan benefits which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was adopted before such date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) was effective for any plan participant before the beginning of the first plan year beginning on or after such date,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the increase arises.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 418B(a) of title 26 as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to section 1402 of this title or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) of title 26 pursuant to section 1403 of this title shall reduce the amount of contributions considered received by the plan for the plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) For purposes of the full funding limitation under subsection (c)(7) of this section, unless otherwise provided by the plan, the accrued liability under a multiemployer plan shall not include benefits which are not nonforfeitable under the plan after the termination of the plan (taking into consideration section 411(d)(3) of title 26).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this part, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of this part, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this part, the value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, this subparagraph shall not apply, but the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of such plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under subsection (b)(5) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:380 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a plan other than a multiemployer plan, each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) or which, in the aggregate, result in a total contribution equivalent to that which would be determined if each such assumption and method were reasonable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a multiemployer plan, which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experiences of the plan and reasonable expectations), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a change in the definition of the term &ldquo;wages&rdquo; under section 3121 of title 26, or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5) of title 26,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) <cap-smallcap>Approval required for certain changes in assumptions by certain single-employer plans subject to additional funding requirement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No actuarial assumption (other than the assumptions described in subsection (d)(7)(C) of this section) used to determine the current liability for a plan to which this subparagraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Plans to which subparagraph applies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subparagraph shall apply to a plan only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which subchapter III of this chapter applies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the aggregate unfunded vested benefits as of the close of the preceding plan year (as determined under section 1306(a)(3)(E)(iii) of this title) of such plan and all other plans maintained by the contributing sponsors (as defined in section 1301(a)(13) of this title) and members of such sponsors&rsquo; controlled groups (as defined in section 1301(a)(14) of this title) which are covered by subchapter III of this chapter (disregarding plans with no unfunded vested benefits) exceed $50,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the unfunded current liability of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the current liability of the plan before such change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If, as of the close of a plan year, a plan would (without regard to this paragraph) have an accumulated funding deficiency (determined without regard to the alternative minimum funding standard account permitted under section 1085 of this title) in excess of the full funding limitation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the funding standard account shall be credited with the amount of such excess, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) all amounts described in paragraphs (2), (B), (C), and (D) and (3)(B) of subsection (b) of this section which are required to be amortized shall be considered fully amortized for purposes of such paragraphs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Full-funding limitation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of paragraph (6), the term &ldquo;full-funding limitation&rdquo; means the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the fair market value of the plan's assets, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the value of such assets determined under paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for paragraph (6)(b)</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of paragraph (6)(B), subparagraph (A)(i) shall be applied without regard to subclause (I) thereof.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) alternative methods based on factors other than current liability for the determination of the amount taken into account under subparagraph (A)(i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Minimum amount.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In no event shall the full-funding limitation determined under subparagraph (A) be less than the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) 90 percent of the current liability of the plan (including the expected increase in current liability due to benefits accruing during the plan year), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the value of the plan's assets determined under paragraph (2).</p>
