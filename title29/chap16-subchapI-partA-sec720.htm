<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) work&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in the United States;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to secure, retain, regain, or advance in employment;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:202 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enforcement of subchapter V of this chapter and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the provision of workforce investment activities and vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Individuals who are applicants for such programs or eligible to participate in such programs must be active and full partners in the vocational rehabilitation process, making meaningful and informed choices&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) during assessments for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the selection of employment outcomes for the individuals, services needed to achieve the outcomes, entities providing such services, and the methods used to secure such services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Families and other natural supports can play important roles in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability involved requests, desires, or needs such supports.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Individuals with disabilities and the individuals&rsquo; representatives are full partners in a vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Accountability measures must facilitate the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most significant disabilities.</p>
