<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) work&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in America;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Individuals with disabilities must be active participants in their own rehabilitation programs, including making meaningful and informed choices about the selection of their vocational goals and objectives and the vocational rehabilitation services they receive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Individuals with disabilities and their advocates are full partners in the vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.</p>
