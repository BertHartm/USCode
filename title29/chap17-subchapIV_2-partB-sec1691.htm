<p class="statutory-body">This part maintains a Job Corps for economically disadvantaged young men and women which shall operate exclusively as a distinct national program, sets forth standards and procedures for selecting individuals as enrollees in the Job Corps, authorizes the establishment of residential and nonresidential centers in which enrollees will participate in intensive programs of education, vocational training, work experience, counseling and other activities, and prescribes various other powers, duties, and responsibilities incident to the operation and continuing development of the Job Corps. The purpose of this part is to assist young individuals who need and can benefit from an unusually intensive program, operated in a group setting, to become more responsible, employable, and productive citizens; and to do so in a way that contributes, where feasible, to the development of national, State, and community resources, and to the development and dissemination of techniques for working with the disadvantaged that can be widely utilized by public and private institutions and agencies.</p>
