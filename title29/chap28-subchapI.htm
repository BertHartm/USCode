<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Entitlement to leave</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Relationship to paid leave</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Unpaid leave</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an employer provides paid leave for fewer than 12 workweeks, the additional weeks of leave necessary to attain the 12 workweeks of leave required under this subchapter may be provided without compensation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substitution of paid leave</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Serious health condition</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Foreseeable leave</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which the necessity for leave under subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section is foreseeable based on an expected birth or placement, the employee shall provide the employer with not less than 30 days&rsquo; notice, before the date the leave is to begin, of the employee's intention to take leave under such subparagraph, except that if the date of the birth or placement requires leave to begin in less than 30 days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duties of employee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which the necessity for leave under subparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection (a)(1) of this section is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer, subject to the approval of the health care provider of the employee or the health care provider of the son, daughter, spouse, or parent of the employee, as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall provide the employer with not less than 30 days&rsquo; notice, before the date the leave is to begin, of the employee's intention to take leave under such subparagraph, except that if the date of the treatment requires leave to begin in less than 30 days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Spouses employed by same employer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which a husband and wife entitled to leave under subsection (a) of this section are employed by the same employer, the aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both may be entitled may be limited to 12 workweeks during any 12-month period, if such leave is taken&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to care for a sick parent under subparagraph (C) of such subsection.</p>
