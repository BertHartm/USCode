<p class="statutory-body">A copy of the complaint in any action under this subchapter by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (other than an action brought by one or more participants or beneficiaries under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section which is solely for the purpose of recovering benefits due such participants under the terms of the plan) shall be served upon the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury by certified mail.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State insurance law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State insurance law described in this subsection is a law that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for purposes of enforcing provisions of State insurance laws that apply to a church plan that is a welfare plan, the church plan shall be subject to State enforcement as if the church plan were an insurer licensed by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the application of this section is limited to determining the status of a church plan that is a welfare plan under the provisions of State insurance laws described in subsection (b) of this section.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A leading obstacle to expanding retirement savings is the simple fact that far too many Americans&mdash;particularly the young&mdash;are either unaware of, or without the knowledge and resources necessary to take advantage of, the extensive benefits offered by our retirement savings system.</p>
