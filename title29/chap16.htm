<h3 class="section-head">&sect;718. Traditionally underserved populations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VII of this chapter, the Congress finds as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Racial profile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The racial profile of America is rapidly changing. While the rate of increase for white Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Latinos, 14.6 percent for Af<!-- PDFPage:198 -->rican-Americans, and 40.1 percent for Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups. By the year 2000, the Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three of whom will be either African-American, Latino, or Asian-American.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. The rate of work-related disability for American Indians is about one and one-half times that of the general population. African-Americans are also one and one-half times more likely to be disabled than whites and twice as likely to be significantly disabled.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inequitable treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recruitment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of preservice training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Outreach to minorities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director of the National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation Research (referred to in this subsection as the &ldquo;Director&rdquo;) shall reserve 1 percent of the funds appropriated for the fiscal year for programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII of this chapter to carry out this subsection. The Commissioner and the Director shall use the reserved funds to carry out one or more of the activities described in paragraph (2) through a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The activities carried out by the Commissioner and the Director shall include one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to carry out activities under the programs authorized under subchapters II, III, VI, and VII of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Making awards to minority entities and Indian tribes to conduct research, training, technical assistance, or a related activity, to improve services provided under this chapter, especially services provided to individuals from minority backgrounds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Making awards to entities described in paragraph (3) to provide outreach and technical assistance to minority entities and Indian tribes to promote their participation in activities funded under this chapter, including assistance to enhance their capacity to carry out such activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To be eligible to receive an award under paragraph (2)(C), an entity shall be a State or a public or private nonprofit agency or organization, such as an institution of higher education or an Indian tribe.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In each fiscal year, the Commissioner and the Director shall prepare and submit to Congress a report that describes the activities funded under this subsection for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Historically Black college or university</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;historically Black college or university&rdquo; means a part B institution, as defined in section 1061(2) of title 20.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minority entity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;minority entity&rdquo; means an entity that is a historically Black college or university, a Hispanic-serving institution of higher education, an American Indian tribal college or university, or another institution of higher education whose minority student enrollment is at least 50 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Demonstration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In awarding grants, or entering into contracts or cooperative agreements under subchapters I, II, III, VI, and VII of this chapter, and section 794e of this title, the Commissioner and the Director, in appropriate cases, shall require applicants to demonstrate how the applicants will address, in whole or in part, the needs of individuals with disabilities from minority backgrounds.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) work&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in the United States;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) reasons for significant numbers of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at levels not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) discrimination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) fear of losing health coverage under the medicare and medicaid programs carried out under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. and 1396 et seq.) or fear of losing private health insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to secure, retain, regain, or advance in employment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enforcement of subchapter V of this chapter and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the provision of workforce investment activities and vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) linkages between the vocational rehabilitation programs established under this subchapter and other components of the statewide workforce investment systems are critical to ensure effective and meaningful participation by individuals with disabilities in workforce investment activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each of which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an integral part of a statewide workforce investment system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain gainful employment in integrated settings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Individuals who are applicants for such programs or eligible to participate in such programs must be active and full partners in the vocational rehabilitation process, making meaningful and informed choices&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) during assessments for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the selection of employment outcomes for the individuals, services needed to achieve the outcomes, entities providing such services, and the methods used to secure such services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Families and other natural supports can play important roles in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability involved requests, desires, or needs such supports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Vocational rehabilitation counselors that are trained and prepared in accordance <!-- PDFPage:200 -->with State policies and procedures as described in section 721(a)(7)(B) of this title (referred to individually in this subchapter as a &ldquo;qualified vocational rehabilitation counselor&rdquo;), other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel facilitate the accomplishment of the employment outcomes and objectives of an individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Individuals with disabilities and the individuals&rsquo; representatives are full partners in a vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Accountability measures must facilitate the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most significant disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of making grants to States under part B of this subchapter to assist States in meeting the costs of vocational rehabilitation services provided in accordance with State plans under section 721 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1999 through 2003, except that the amount to be appropriated for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of the appropriation under this paragraph for the immediately preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index determined under subsection (c) of this section for the immediately preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reference in paragraph (1) to grants to States under part B of this subchapter shall not be considered to refer to grants under section 732 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">No later than November 15 of each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1979), the Secretary of Labor shall publish in the Federal Register the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published for October of the preceding fiscal year and October of the fiscal year in which such publication is made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Application</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b)(1) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) of this section for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No increase or decrease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b)(1) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated under subsection (b)(1) of this section for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Consumer Price Index&rdquo; means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Criterion for eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual is eligible for assistance under this subchapter if the individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is an individual with a disability under section 705(20)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, or regain employment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Presumption of benefit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Demonstration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, an individual shall be presumed to be an individual that can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services under section 705(20)(A) of this title, unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making the demonstration required under subparagraph (A), the designated State unit shall explore the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations, through the use of trial work experiences, as described in section 705(2)(D) of this title, with appropriate supports provided through the designated State unit, except under limited circumstances when an individual cannot take advantage of such experiences. Such experiences shall be of sufficient variety and over a sufficient period of time to determine the eligibility of the individual or to determine the existence of clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Presumption of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, an individual who has a disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. and 1381 et seq.) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) considered to be an individual with a significant disability under section 705(21)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter (provided that the individual intends to achieve an employment outcome consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual) unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of bene<!-- PDFPage:212 -->fiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create an entitlement to any vocational rehabilitation service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of existing information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the maximum extent appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part, for purposes of determining the eligibility of an individual for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter and developing the individualized plan for employment described in subsection (b) of this section for the individual, the designated State unit shall use information that is existing and current (as of the date of the determination of eligibility or of the development of the individualized plan for employment), including information available from other programs and providers, particularly information used by education officials and the Social Security Administration, information provided by the individual and the family of the individual, and information obtained under the assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The determination of eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the review of existing data described in section 705(2)(A)(i) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent that such data is unavailable or insufficient for determining eligibility, the provision of assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Determination of ineligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual who applies for services under this subchapter is determined, based on the review of existing data and, to the extent necessary, the assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title, not to be eligible for the services, or if an eligible individual receiving services under an individualized plan for employment is determined to be no longer eligible for the services&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) within 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) thereafter, if such a review is requested by the individual or, if appropriate, by the individual's representative.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The designated State unit shall determine whether an individual is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, after the individual has submitted an application for the services unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the designated State unit preclude making an eligibility determination within 60 days and the designated State unit and the individual agree to a specific extension of time; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the designated State unit is exploring an individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations under paragraph (2)(B).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), from each State's allotment under this part for any fiscal year, the Commissioner shall pay to a State an amount equal to the Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for that State approved under section 721 of this title, including expenditures for the administration of the State plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The total of payments under paragraph (1) to a State for a fiscal year may not exceed its allotment under subsection (a) of section 730 of this title for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For fiscal year 1994 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for the previous fiscal year are less than the total of such expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commissioner may waive or modify any requirement or limitation under subparagraph (B) or section 721(a)(17) of this title if the Commissioner determines that a waiver or modification is an equitable response to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of a payment under this section with respect to any construction project in any State shall be equal to the same percentage of the cost of such project as the Federal share that is applicable in the case of rehabilitation facilities (as defined in section 291<em>o</em>(g) of title 42), in such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Federal share with respect to rehabilitation facilities in such State is determined pursuant to section 291<em>o</em>(b)(2) of title 42, the percentage of the cost for purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner designed to achieve as nearly as practicable results comparable to the results obtained under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of computation and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method of computing and paying amounts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Commissioner shall, prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter or other period prescribed by the Commissioner, estimate the amount to be paid to each State under the provisions of such subsection for such period, such estimate to be based on such records of the State and information furnished by it, and such other investigation as the Commissioner may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commissioner shall pay, from the allotment available therefor, the amount so estimated by the Commissioner for such period, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (not previously adjusted under this paragraph) by which the Commissioner finds that the estimate of the amount to be paid the State for any prior period under such subsection was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such prior period under such subsection. Such payment shall be made prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, shall be made through the disbursing facilities of the Treasury Department, and shall be made in such installments as the Commissioner may determine.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of grant program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From funds appropriated under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary shall, in accordance with this section, make grants to States to establish and carry out client assistance programs to provide assistance in informing and advising all clients and client applicants of all available benefits under this chapter, and, upon request of such clients or client applicants, to assist and advocate for such clients or applicants in their relationships with projects, programs, and services provided under this chapter, including assistance and advocacy in pursuing legal, administrative, or other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of the rights of such individuals under this chapter and to facilitate access to the services funded under this chapter through individual and systemic advocacy. The client assistance program shall provide information on the available services and benefits under this chapter and title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) to individuals with disabil<!-- PDFPage:227 -->ities in the State, especially with regard to individuals with disabilities who have traditionally been unserved or underserved by vocational rehabilitation programs. In providing assistance and advocacy under this subsection with respect to services under this subchapter, a client assistance program may provide the assistance and advocacy with respect to services that are directly related to facilitating the employment of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Existence of State program as requisite to receiving payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State may receive payments from its allotment under this chapter in any fiscal year unless the State has in effect not later than October 1, 1984, a client assistance program which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has the authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of rights of individuals with disabilities who are receiving treatments, services, or rehabilitation under this chapter within the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) meets the requirements of designation under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Designation of agency to conduct program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Governor shall designate a public or private agency to conduct the client assistance program under this section. Except as provided in the last sentence of this subparagraph, the Governor shall designate an agency which is independent of any agency which provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals under this chapter. If there is an agency in the State which has, or had, prior to February 22, 1984, served as a client assistance agency under this section and which received Federal financial assistance under this chapter, the Governor may, in the initial designation, designate an agency which provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals with disabilities under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The Governor may not redesignate the agency designated under subparagraph (A) without good cause and unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Governor has given the agency 30 days notice of the intention to make such redesignation, including specification of the good cause for such redesignation and an opportunity to respond to the assertion that good cause has been shown;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) individuals with disabilities or the individuals&rsquo; representatives have timely notice of the redesignation and opportunity for public comment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the agency has the opportunity to appeal to the Commissioner on the basis that the redesignation was not for good cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If, after August 7, 1998&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a designated State agency undergoes any change in the organizational structure of the agency that results in the creation of one or more new State agencies or departments or results in the merger of the designated State agency with one or more other State agencies or departments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an agency (including an office or other unit) within the designated State agency was conducting a client assistance program before the change under the last sentence of subparagraph (A),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Governor shall redesignate the agency conducting the program. In conducting the redesignation, the Governor shall designate to conduct the program an agency that is independent of any agency that provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals with disabilities under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Governor shall consult with the director of the State vocational rehabilitation agency, the head of the developmental disability protection and advocacy agency, and with representatives of professional and consumer organizations serving individuals with disabilities in the State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) In any fiscal year that the funds appropriated for such fiscal year exceed $7,500,000, the minimum allotment shall be $100,000 for States and $45,000 for territories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For any fiscal year in which the total amount appropriated under subsection (h) of this section exceeds the total amount appropriated under such subsection for the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments under clause (i) by a percentage that shall not exceed the percentage increase in the total amount appropriated under such subsection between the preceding fiscal year and the fiscal year involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of an allotment to a State for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required by the State during the period for which it is available for the purpose for which allotted shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary at appropriate times to other States with respect to which such a determination has not been made, in proportion to the original allotments of such States for such fiscal year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use during such period, and the total of such reduction shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any such amount so reallotted to a State for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of its allotment for such fiscal year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:228 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as specifically prohibited by or as otherwise provided in State law, the Secretary shall pay to the agency designated under subsection (c) of this section the amount specified in the application approved under subsection (f) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Each program shall be afforded reasonable access to policymaking and administrative personnel in the State and local rehabilitation programs, projects, or facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Each program shall contain provisions designed to assure that to the maximum extent possible alternative means of dispute resolution are available for use at the discretion of an applicant or client of the program prior to resorting to litigation or formal adjudication to resolve a dispute arising under this section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13163. Increasing the Opportunity for Individuals With Disabilities To Be Employed in the Federal Government</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13163, July 26, 2000, 65 F.R. 46563, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote an increase in the opportunities for individuals with disabilities to be employed at all levels and occupations of the Federal Government, and to support the goals articulated in section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Increasing the Federal Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities</em>. (a) Recent evidence demonstrates that, throughout the United States, qualified persons with disabilities have been refused employment despite their availability and qualifications, and many qualified persons with disabilities are never made aware of available employment opportunities. Evidence also suggests that increased efforts at outreach, and increased understanding of the reasonable accommodations available for persons with disabilities, will permit persons with disabilities to compete for employment on a more level playing field.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Based on current hiring patterns and anticipated increases from expanded outreach efforts and appropriate accommodations, the Federal Government, over the next 5 years, will be able to hire 100,000 qualified individuals with disabilities. In furtherance of such efforts, Federal agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) Use available hiring authorities, consistent with statutes, regulations, and prior Executive orders and Presidential Memoranda;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Expand their outreach efforts, using both traditional and nontraditional methods; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) Increase their efforts to accommodate individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) As a model employer, the Federal Government will take the lead in educating the public about employment opportunities available for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This order does not require agencies to create new positions or to change existing qualification standards for any position.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Implementation</em>. Each Federal agency shall prepare a plan to increase the opportunities for individuals with disabilities to be employed in the agency. Each agency shall submit that plan to the Office of Personnel Management within 60 days from the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Authority to Develop Guidance</em>. The Office of Personnel Management shall develop guidance on the provisions of this order to increase the opportunities <!-- PDFPage:260 -->for individuals with disabilities employed in the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, its employees, or any person.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13164. Requiring Federal Agencies To Establish Procedures To Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13164, July 26, 2000, 65 F.R. 46565, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq</em>.), as amended, and in order to promote a model Federal workplace that provides reasonable accommodation for (1) individuals with disabilities in the application process for Federal employment; (2) Federal employees with disabilities to perform the essential functions of a position; and (3) Federal employees with disabilities to enjoy benefits and privileges of employment equal to those enjoyed by employees without disabilities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Establishment of Effective Written Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation</em>. (a) Each Federal agency shall establish effective written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation by employees and applicants with disabilities. The written procedures may allow different components of an agency to tailor their procedures as necessary to ensure the expeditious processing of requests.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As set forth in <em>Re-charting the Course: The First Report of the Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities</em> (1998), effective written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation should include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) Explain that an employee or job applicant may initiate a request for reasonable accommodation orally or in writing. If the agency requires an applicant or employee to complete a reasonable accommodation request form for recordkeeping purposes, the form must be provided as an attachment to the agency's written procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Explain how the agency will process a request for reasonable accommodation, and from whom the individual will receive a final decision;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) Designate a time period during which reasonable accommodation requests will be granted or denied, absent extenuating circumstances. Time limits for decision making should be as short as reasonably possible;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) Explain the responsibility of the employee or applicant to provide appropriate medical information related to the functional impairment at issue and the requested accommodation where the disability and/or need for accommodation is not obvious;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) Explain the agency's right to request relevant supplemental medical information if the information submitted does not clearly explain the nature of the disability, or the need for the reasonable accommodation, or does not otherwise clarify how the requested accommodation will assist the employee to perform the essential functions of the job or to enjoy the benefits and privileges of the workplace;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(6) Explain the agency's right to have medical information reviewed by a medical expert of the agency's choosing at the agency's expense;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(7) Provide that reassignment will be considered as a reasonable accommodation if the agency determines that no other reasonable accommodation will permit the employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of his or her current position;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(8) Provide that reasonable accommodation denials be in writing and specify the reasons for denial;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(9) Ensure that agencies&rsquo; systems of recordkeeping track the processing of requests for reasonable accommodation and maintain the confidentiality of medical information received in accordance with applicable law and regulations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(10) Encourage the use of informal dispute resolution processes to allow individuals with disabilities to obtain prompt reconsideration of denials of reasonable accommodation. Agencies must also inform individuals with disabilities that they have the right to file complaints in the Equal Employment Opportunity process and other statutory processes, as appropriate, if their requests for reasonable accommodation are denied.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Submission of Agency Reasonable Accommodation Procedures to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</em>. Within 1 year from the date of this order, each agency shall submit its procedures to the EEOC. Each agency shall also submit to the EEOC any modifications to its reasonable accommodation procedures at the time that those modifications are adopted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Collective Bargaining Obligations</em>. In adopting their reasonable accommodation procedures, agencies must honor their obligations to notify their collective bargaining representatives and bargain over such procedures to the extent required by law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Implementation</em>. The EEOC shall issue guidance for the implementation of this order within 90 days from the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Construction and Judicial Review</em>. (a) Nothing in this order limits the rights that individuals with disabilities may have under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, its employees, or any person.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount of contracts or subcontracts; provision for employment and advancement of qualified individuals with disabilities; regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract in excess of $10,000 entered into by any Federal department or agency for the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services (including construction) for the United States shall contain a provision requiring that the party contracting with the United States shall take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities. The provisions of this section shall apply to any subcontract in excess of $10,000 entered into by a prime contractor in carrying out any contract for the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services (including construction) for the United States. The President shall implement the provisions of this section by promulgating regulations within ninety days after September 26, 1973.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative enforcement; complaints; investigations; departmental action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any individual with a disability believes any contractor has failed or refused to comply with the provisions of a contract with the United States, relating to employment of individuals with disabilities, such individual may file a complaint with the Department of Labor. The Department shall promptly investigate such complaint and shall take such action thereon as the facts and circumstances warrant, consistent <!-- PDFPage:267 -->with the terms of such contract and the laws and regulations applicable thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver by President; national interest special circumstances for waiver of particular agreements; waiver by Secretary of Labor of affirmative action requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The requirements of this section may be waived, in whole or in part, by the President with respect to a particular contract or subcontract, in accordance with guidelines set forth in regulations which the President shall prescribe, when the President determines that special circumstances in the national interest so require and states in writing the reasons for such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Labor may waive the requirements of the affirmative action clause required by regulations promulgated under subsection (a) of this section with respect to any of a prime contractor's or subcontractor's facilities that are found to be in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the prime contractor or subcontractor related to the performance of the contract or subcontract, if the Secretary of Labor also finds that such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such waivers shall be considered only upon the request of the contractor or subcontractor. The Secretary of Labor shall promulgate regulations that set forth the standards used for granting such a waiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Standards used in determining violation of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) and the provisions of sections 501 through 504, and 510, of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12201&ndash;12204 and 12210), as such sections relate to employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Avoidance of duplicative efforts and inconsistencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop procedures to ensure that administrative complaints filed under this section and under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.] are dealt with in a manner that avoids duplication of effort and prevents imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards for the same requirements under this section and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Initial year</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The director of a designated State unit, as provided in paragraph (2), or the Commissioner, as provided in paragraph (3), shall award grants under this section for an initial fiscal year if the Commissioner determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by a State for a preceding fiscal year to support the general operation of centers for independent living meeting the requirements of this subpart equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State under subsection (c) or (d) of section 796f of this title for such year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each year subsequent to the initial fiscal year described in subparagraph (A), the director of the designated State unit shall continue to have the authority to award such grants under this section if the Commissioner determines that the State continues to earmark the amount of State funds described in subparagraph (A)(i). If the State does not continue to earmark such an amount for a fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants under this section after a final year following such fiscal year, as defined in accordance with regulations established by the Commissioner, and for each subsequent fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Grants by designated State units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order for the designated State unit to be eligible to award the grants described in paragraph (1) and carry out this section for a fiscal year with respect to a State, the designated State agency shall submit an application to the Commissioner at such time, and in such manner as the Commissioner may require, in<!-- PDFPage:292 -->cluding information about the amount of State funds described in paragraph (1) for the preceding fiscal year.
