<p class="note-body">Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (<em>Kennedy v.

Therefore, for purposes of codification, this chapter should be deemed to have been amended by Pub. L. 93&ndash;651, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2&ndash;3, in exactly the same manner as it was amended by Pub. L. 93&ndash;516, Dec. 7, 1974, 88 Stat. 1617.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the programs authorized in subchapters II through VIII of this chapter, the Congress finds as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Racial profile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The racial profile of America is rapidly changing. While the rate of increase for white Americans is 3.2 percent, the rate of increase for racial and ethnic minorities is much higher: 38.6 percent for Latinos, 14.6 percent for African-Americans, and 40.1 percent for Asian-Americans and other ethnic groups. By the year 2000, the Nation will have 260,000,000 people, one of every three of whom will be either African-American, Latino, or Asian-American.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rate of disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Ethnic and racial minorities tend to have disabling conditions at a disproportionately high rate. The rate of work-related disability for American Indians is about one and one-half times that of the general population. African-Americans are also one and one-half times more likely to be disabled than whites and twice as likely to be severely disabled.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inequitable treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Patterns of inequitable treatment of minorities have been documented in all major junctures of the vocational rehabilitation process. As compared to white Americans, a larger percentage of African-American applicants to the vocational rehabilitation system is denied acceptance. Of applicants accepted for service, a larger percentage of African-American cases is closed without being rehabilitated. Minorities are provided less training than their white counterparts. Consistently, less money is spent on minorities than on their white counterparts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Recruitment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Recruitment efforts within vocational rehabilitation at the level of pre-service training, continuing education, and in-service training must focus on bringing larger numbers of minorities into the profession in order to provide appropriate practitioner knowledge, role models, and sufficient manpower to address the clearly changing demography of vocational rehabilitation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Outreach to minorities</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) work&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in America;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) reasons for the significant number of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at a level not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) discrimination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) fear of losing health coverage under the medicare and medicaid programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. and 1396 et seq.) or fear of losing existing private health insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to enter or retain or advance in employment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) enforcement of subchapter V of this chapter and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the provision of vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating a comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable program of vocational rehabilitation that is designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain gainful employment in integrated settings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Individuals with disabilities must be active participants in their own rehabilitation programs, including making meaningful and informed choices about the selection of their vocational goals and objectives and the vocational rehabilitation services they receive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Families and natural supports can play an important role in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability requests, desires, or needs such supports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Qualified vocational rehabilitation counselors, other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel facilitate the accomplishment of the employment goals and objectives of an individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Individuals with disabilities and their advocates are full partners in the vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Accountability measures must facilitate and not impede the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most severe disabilities.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:201 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out part C of this subchapter such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1993 through 1997.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Percentage change in Consumer Price Index; publication in Federal Register; increase in appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No later than November 15 of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year 1979), the Secretary of Labor shall publish in the Federal Register the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published for October of the preceding fiscal year and October of the fiscal year in which such publication is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Consumer Price Index&rdquo; means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Extension of program authorization or duration; appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Unless the Congress in the regular session which ends prior to the beginning of the terminal fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) of the authorization of appropriations for the program authorized by the State grant program under part B of this subchapter; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount authorized to be appropriated for the additional fiscal year described in subparagraph (A) shall be an amount equal to the amount appropriated for such program for fiscal year 1997, plus the amount of the Consumer Price Index addition determined under subsection (c) of this section for the immediately preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For the purposes of subdivision (i) of paragraph (1), the Congress shall not have been deemed to have passed legislation unless such legislation becomes law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where the Commissioner is required under an applicable statute to carry out certain acts or make certain determinations which are necessary for the continuation of the program authorized by this subchapter, if such acts or determinations are required during the terminal year of such program, such acts and determinations shall be required during any fiscal year in which that part of paragraph (1) of this subsection which follows subdivision (ii) of paragraph (1) is in operation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The Director may not overturn or modify a decision of an impartial hearing officer, or part of such a decision, that supports the position of the individual unless the Director concludes, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the decision of the independent hearing officer is clearly erroneous on the basis of being contrary to Federal or State law, including policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A final decision shall be made in writing by the Director and shall include a full report of the findings and the grounds for such decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, for each fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment of an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount authorized to be appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section as the product of (A) the population of the State, and (B) the square of its allotment percentage, bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment in an amount equal to the amount such State received under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and an additional amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment, from any amount authorized to be appropriated for such fiscal year under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title for allotment under this section in excess of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, in an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The sum of the payment to any State (other than Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau) under this subsection for any fiscal year which is less than one-third of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title, or $3,000,000, whichever is greater, shall be increased to that amount, the total of the increases thereby required being derived by proportionately reducing the allotment to each of the remaining such States under this subsection, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the sum of the allotments made under this subsection to any such remaining State from being thereby reduced to less than that amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1984, for which any amount is appropriated pursuant to section 720(b)(1)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title, each State shall receive an allocation (from such appropriated amount) in addition to the allotment to which such State is entitled under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Republic of Palau may receive allotments or allocations under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional payments; authorization of additional appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a State receives as its Federal share under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year less than the applicable Federal share of the expenditure of such State for fiscal year 1972 for vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for such State approved under section 721 of this title (including any amount expended by such State for the administration of the State plan but excluding any amount expended by such State from non-Federal sources for construction under such plan), such State shall be entitled to an additional payment for such fiscal year, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to other payments under this part, equal to the difference between such payment under section 731(a) of this title and an amount equal to the applicable Federal share of such expenditure for vocational rehabilitation services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any payment attributable to the additional payment to a State under this subsection shall be made only from appropriations specifically made to carry out this subsection, and such additional appropriations are hereby authorized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unused funds; redistribution; increase in amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than forty-five days prior to the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall determine, after reasonable opportunity for the submission to the Commissioner of comments by the State agency administering or supervising the program established under this subchapter, that any payment of an allotment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year will not be utilized by such State in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable but not later than the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter to one or more other States to the extent the Commissioner determines that such other State will be able to use such additional amount during that fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year for car<!-- PDFPage:227 -->rying out such purposes. The Commissioner shall make such amount available only if such other State will be able to make sufficient payments from non-Federal sources to pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the State plan for the fiscal year for which the amount was appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this part, any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection shall be regarded as an increase of such State's allotment (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funds for American Indian vocational rehabilitation services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For fiscal year 1987 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Commissioner shall reserve from the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section a sum, determined under paragraph (2), to carry out the purposes of part D of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The sum referred to in paragraph (1) shall be, as determined by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not less than one-third of one percent and not more than 1.5 percent of the amount under paragraph (1), for fiscal years 1993 and 1994; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), from each State's allotment under this part for any fiscal year, the Commissioner shall pay to a State an amount equal to the Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for that State approved under section 721 of this title, including expenditures for the administration of the State plan and development and implementation of the strategic plan as provided in section 721(a)(34)(A) of this title. Any State that receives such an amount shall expend, for development and implementation of the strategic plan, not less than the percentage of the allotment of the State referred to in section 721(a)(34)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The total of payments under paragraph (1) to a State for a fiscal year may not exceed its allotment under subsection (a),<sup><a href="#731_1_target" name="731_1">1</a></sup> of section 730 of this title for such year and such payments shall not be made in an amount which would result in a violation of the provisions of the State plan required by section 721(a)(17) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) For fiscal year 1993, the amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for the previous fiscal year are less than the average of the total of such expenditures for the 3 fiscal years preceding the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For fiscal year 1994 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for the previous fiscal year are less than the total of such expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commissioner may waive or modify any requirement or limitation under paragraphs (A) and (B) if the Commissioner determines that a waiver or modification is an equitable response to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of a payment under this section with respect to any construction project in any State shall be equal to the same percentage of the cost of such project as the Federal share that is applicable in the case of rehabilitation facilities (as defined in section 291<em>o</em>(g) of title 42), in such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Federal share with respect to rehabilitation facilities in such State is determined pursuant to section 291<em>o</em>(b)(2) of title 42, the percentage of the cost for purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner designed to achieve as nearly as practicable results comparable to the results obtained under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of computation and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method of computing and paying amounts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Commissioner shall, prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter or other period prescribed by the Commissioner, estimate the amount to be paid to each State under the provisions of such subsection for such period, such estimate to be based on such records of the State and information furnished by it, and such other investigation as the Commissioner may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commissioner shall pay, from the allotment available therefor, the amount so estimated by the Commissioner for such period, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (not previously adjusted under this paragraph) by which the Commissioner finds that the estimate of the amount to be paid the State for any prior period under such subsection was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such prior period under such subsection. Such payment shall be made prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office, shall be made through the disbursing facilities of the Treasury Department, and shall be made in such installments as the Commissioner may determine.</p>

The client assistance program shall provide information on the available services and benefits under this chapter and title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) to individuals with disabilities in the State, especially with regard to individuals with disabilities who have traditionally been unserved or underserved by vocational rehabilitation programs.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Governor may not redesignate the agency designated under subparagraph (A) without good cause and unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Governor has given the agency 30 days notice of the intention to make such redesignation, including specification of the good cause for such redesignation and an opportunity to respond to the assertion that good cause has been shown;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of an allotment to a State for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required by the State during the period for which it is available for the purpose for which allotted shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary at appropriate times to other States with respect to which such a determination has not been made, in proportion to the original allotments of such States for such fiscal year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use during such period; and the total of such reduction shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any such amount so reallotted to a State for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of its allotment for such fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Population basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from sums appropriated for each fiscal year to carry out this part (not including sums used in accordance with section 721(a)(34)(B) of this title), the Commissioner shall make an allotment to each State whose State plan has been approved under section 721 of this title of an amount bearing the same ratio to such sums as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this part, the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $200,000 or one-third of one percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $200,000 or one-third of one percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain territories</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of paragraph (1)(B), Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau shall not be considered to be States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each jurisdiction described in subparagraph (A) shall be allotted under paragraph (1)(A) not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available for purposes of this part for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, except that the Republic of Palau may receive such allotment under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustment for inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1994, in which the total amount appropriated to carry out this part exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this part for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Commissioner shall increase the minimum allotment under paragraph (1)(B) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proportional reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide minimum allotments to States (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, or to provide minimum allotments to States under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, the Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allot<!-- PDFPage:235 -->ments of the remaining States under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any such remaining State from being reduced to less than the minimum allotment for a State (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, or the minimum allotment for a State under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by such State for carrying out the provisions of this part, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this part to one or more of the States that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section to assist and encourage the provision of needed community rehabilitation programs for individuals with disabilities primarily served by State rehabilitation programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Loans to nonprofit entities by non-Federal lenders and Federal Financing Bank; construction; equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner may, under special circumstances and in accordance with this section and subject to section 776 of this title, guarantee the payment of principal and interest on loans made to nonprofit private entities by non-Federal lenders and by the Federal Financing Bank for the construction of facilities for community rehabilitation programs, including equipment used in their operation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment by Commissioner for reduction of effective interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a guarantee of any loan to a nonprofit private entity under this section, the Commissioner shall pay, to the holder of such loan and for and on behalf of the project for which the loan was made, amounts sufficient to reduce by 2 percent per annum the net effective interest rate otherwise payable on such loan. Each holder of a loan which is guaranteed under this section shall have a contractual right to receive from the United States interest payments required by the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on amount of principal of outstanding loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The cumulative total of the principal of the loans outstanding at any time with respect to which guarantees have been issued, or which have been directly made, may not exceed $100,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commissioner may not approve a loan guarantee for a project under this section unless the Commissioner determines that (A) the terms, conditions, security (if any), and schedule and amount of repayments with respect to the loan are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States and are otherwise reasonable, including a determination that the rate of interest does not exceed such per centum per annum on the principal obligation outstanding as the Commissioner determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United States, and (B) the loan would not be available on reasonable terms and conditions without the guarantee under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The United States shall be entitled to recover from the applicant for a loan guarantee under this section the amount of any payment made pursuant to such guarantee, unless the Commissioner for good cause waives such right of recovery. Upon making any such payment, the United States shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the recipient of the payments with respect to which the guarantee was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) To the extent permitted by subparagraph (C), any terms and conditions applicable to a loan guarantee under this section (including terms and conditions imposed under paragraph (1)) may be modified by the Commissioner to the extent considered consistent with the interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any loan guarantee made by the Commissioner under this section shall be incontestable (i) in the hands of an applicant on whose behalf <!-- PDFPage:262 -->such guarantee is made unless the applicant engaged in fraud or misrepresentation in securing such guarantee, and (ii) as to any person (or a successor in interest) who makes or contracts to make a loan to such applicant in reliance thereon unless such person (or a successor in interest) engaged in fraud or misrepresentation in making or contracting to make such loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Guarantees of loans under this section shall be subject to such further terms and conditions as the Commissioner considers necessary to assure that the purposes of this section will be achieved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Establishment in Treasury of loan guarantee fund; authorization of appropriations; insufficient funds; issuance of notes and other obligations to Secretary of the Treasury; interest rate and redemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is established in the Treasury a loan guarantee fund (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;) which shall be available to the Commissioner without fiscal year limitation, in such amounts as may be specified from time to time in appropriation Acts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to enable the Commissioner to discharge the responsibilities under loan guarantees issued under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for payment of interest under subsection (c) of this section on loans guaranteed under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">There are authorized to be appropriated such amounts as may be necessary to provide the sums required for the fund. There shall also be deposited in the fund amounts received by the Commissioner in connection with loan guarantees under this section and other property or assets derived by the Commissioner from operations respecting such loan guarantees, including any money derived from the sale of assets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If at any time the sums in the fund are insufficient to enable the Commissioner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to make payments of interest under subsection (c) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to otherwise comply with guarantees under this section of loans to nonprofit private entities;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commissioner is authorized to issue to the Secretary of the Treasury notes or other obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions, as may be prescribed by the Commissioner with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such notes or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the notes or other obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any notes and other obligations issued under this paragraph, and for that purpose the Secretary may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31. The purposes for which securities may be issued under that chapter are extended to include any purchase of such notes and obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by the Secretary under this paragraph. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes or other obligations shall be treated as a public debt transaction of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Sums borrowed under this paragraph shall be deposited in the fund and redemption of such notes and obligations shall be made by the Commissioner from the fund.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the United States shall be entitled to recover from the grant recipient or other owner of the facility an amount which bears the same ratio to the value of the facility (or so much thereof as constituted an approved project or projects) <!-- PDFPage:264 -->at the time the United States seeks recovery as the amount of such Federal funds bore to the cost of renovating the facility under subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii) of this section.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount of contracts or subcontracts; provision for employment and advancement of qualified individuals with disabilities; regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract in excess of $10,000 entered into by any Federal department or agency for the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services (including construction) for the United States shall contain a provision requiring that the party contracting with the United States shall take affirmative action to employ and advance in employment qualified individuals with disabilities. The provisions of this section shall apply to any subcontract in excess of $10,000 entered into by a prime contractor in carrying out any contract for the procurement of personal property and nonpersonal services (including construction) for the United States. The President shall implement the provisions of this section by promulgating regulations within ninety days after September 26, 1973.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative enforcement; complaints; investigations; departmental action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any individual with a disability believes any contractor has failed or refused to comply with the provisions of a contract with the United States, relating to employment of individuals with disabilities, such individual may file a complaint with the Department of Labor. The Department shall promptly investigate such complaint and shall take such action thereon as the facts and circumstances warrant, consistent with the terms of such contract and the laws and regulations applicable thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver by President; national interest special circumstances for waiver of particular agreements; waiver by Secretary of Labor of affirmative action requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The requirements of this section may be waived, in whole or in part, by the President with respect to a particular contract or subcontract, in accordance with guidelines set forth in regulations which the President shall prescribe, when the President determines that special circumstances in the national interest so require and states in writing the reasons for such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary of Labor may waive the requirements of the affirmative action clause required by regulations promulgated under subsection (a) of this section with respect to any of a prime contractor's or subcontractor's facilities that are found to be in all respects separate and distinct from activities of the prime con<!-- PDFPage:288 -->tractor or subcontractor related to the performance of the contract or subcontract, if the Secretary of Labor also finds that such a waiver will not interfere with or impede the effectuation of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such waivers shall be considered only upon the request of the contractor or subcontractor. The Secretary of Labor shall promulgate regulations that set forth the standards used for granting such a waiver.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Standards used in determining violation of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The standards used to determine whether this section has been violated in a complaint alleging nonaffirmative action employment discrimination under this section shall be the standards applied under title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) and the provisions of sections 501 through 504, and 510, of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12201&ndash;12204 and 12210), as such sections relate to employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Avoidance of duplicative efforts and inconsistencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop procedures to ensure that administrative complaints filed under this section and under the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.] are dealt with in a manner that avoids duplication of effort and prevents imposition of inconsistent or conflicting standards for the same requirements under this section and the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appropriations less than $5,500,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry out this section is less than $5,500,000, the Commissioner may make grants from such amount to eligible systems within States to plan for, develop outreach strategies for, and carry out protection and advocacy programs authorized under this section for individuals with disabilities who meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allotments</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Systems within States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Population basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from such remainder for each such fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make an allotment to the eligible system within a State of an amount bearing the same ratio to such remainder as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this section, and except as provided in paragraph (4), the allotment to any system under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $100,000 or one-third of one percent of the remainder for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment to any system under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $100,000 or one-third of one percent of such remainder shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Adjustment for inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1994, in which the total amount appropriated to carry out this section exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this section for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Commissioner shall increase the minimum allotment under paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.</p>

Any amount made available to a system for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the system (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Population basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C), from sums appropriated for each fiscal year to carry out this subpart, the Commissioner shall make an allotment to each State whose State plan has been approved under section 796d&ndash;1 of this title of an amount bearing the same ratio to such sums as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Maintenance of 1992 amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, the amount of any allotment made under subparagraph (A) to a State for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of an allotment made to the State for fiscal year 1992 under part A of this subchapter, as in effect on the day before October 29, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Minimums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, and except as provided in subparagraph (B), the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $275,000 or one-third of one percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $275,000 or one-third of one percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain territories</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of paragraph (1)(C), Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau shall not be considered to be States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each jurisdiction described in subparagraph (A) shall be allotted under paragraph (1)(A) not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available for purposes of this subpart for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, except that the Republic of Palau may receive such allotment under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustment for inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1994, in which the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this subpart for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage <!-- PDFPage:311 -->greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Commissioner shall increase the minimum allotment under paragraph (1)(C) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proportional reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide allotments to States in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, to provide minimum allotments to States (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section, or to provide minimum allotments to States under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, the Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the remaining States under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any such remaining State from being reduced to less than the amount required by subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by such State in carrying out the provisions of this subpart, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the provisions of this subpart to one or more of the States that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
