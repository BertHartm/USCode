<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is essential that criteria for measuring the return on this investment be developed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the basic return on the investment is to be measured by long-term economic self-sufficiency, increased employment and earnings, reductions in welfare dependency, and increased educational attainment and occupational skills.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subchapter II performance standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General objective</h4>
