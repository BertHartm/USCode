<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Disability is a natural part of the human experience and in no way diminishes the right of individuals to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) live independently;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enjoy self-determination and make choices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) benefit from an education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) pursue meaningful careers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enjoy full inclusion and integration in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of society in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Technology has become one of the primary engines for economic activity, education, and innovation in the Nation, and throughout the world. The commitment of the United States to the development and utilization of technology is one of the main factors underlying the strength and vibrancy of the economy of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) As technology has come to play an increasingly important role in the lives of all persons in the United States, in the conduct of business, in the functioning of government, in the fostering of communication, in the conduct of commerce, and in the provision of education, its impact upon the lives of the more than 50,000,000 individuals with disabilities in the United States has been comparable to its impact upon the remainder of the citizens of the United States. Any development in mainstream technology would have profound implications for individuals with disabilities in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Substantial progress has been made in the development of assistive technology devices, including adaptations to existing devices that facilitate activities of daily living, that significantly benefit individuals with disabilities of all ages. Such devices and adaptations increase the involvement of such individuals in, and reduce expenditures associated with, programs and activities such as early intervention, education, rehabilitation and training, employment, residential living, independent living, and recreation programs and activities, and other aspects of daily living.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) All States have comprehensive statewide programs of technology-related assistance. Federal support for such programs should continue, strengthening the capacity of each State to assist individuals with disabilities of all ages with their assistive technology needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Notwithstanding the efforts of such State programs, there is still a lack of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) resources to pay for assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) trained personnel to assist individuals with disabilities to use such devices and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) information among targeted individuals about the availability and potential benefit of technology for individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) outreach to underrepresented populations and rural populations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) systems that ensure timely acquisition and delivery of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) coordination among State human services programs, and between such programs and private entities, particularly with respect to transitions between such programs and entities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) capacity in such programs to provide the necessary technology-related assistance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) In the current technological environment, the line of demarcation between assistive technology and mainstream technology is becoming ever more difficult to draw.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Many individuals with disabilities cannot access existing telecommunications and information technologies and are at risk of not being able to access developing technologies. The failure of Federal and State governments, hardware manufacturers, software designers, information systems managers, and telecommunications service providers to account for the specific needs of individuals with disabilities in the design, manufacture, and procurement of telecommunications and information technologies results in the exclusion of such individuals from the use of telecommunications and information technologies and re<!-- PDFPage:699 -->sults in unnecessary costs associated with the retrofitting of devices and product systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) There are insufficient incentives for Federal contractors and other manufacturers of technology to address the application of technology advances to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities of all ages for assistive technology devices and assistive technology services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The use of universal design principles reduces the need for many specific kinds of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services by building in accommodations for individuals with disabilities before rather than after production. The use of universal design principles also increases the likelihood that products (including services) will be compatible with existing assistive technologies. These principles are increasingly important to enhance access to information technology, telecommunications, transportation, physical structures, and consumer products. There are insufficient incentives for commercial manufacturers to incorporate universal design principles into the design and manufacturing of technology products, including devices of daily living, that could expand their immediate use by individuals with disabilities of all ages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) There are insufficient incentives for commercial pursuit of the application of technology devices to meet the needs of individuals with disabilities, because of the perception that such individuals constitute a limited market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) At the Federal level, the Federal Laboratories, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and other similar entities do not recognize the value of, or commit resources on an ongoing basis to, technology transfer initiatives that would benefit, and especially increase the independence of, individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) At the Federal level, there is a lack of coordination among agencies that provide or pay for the provision of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services. In addition, the Federal Government does not provide adequate assistance and information with respect to the quality and use of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services to targeted individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) There are changes in the delivery of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the impact of the increased prevalence of managed care entities as payors for assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an increased focus on universal design;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the increased importance of assistive technology in employment, as more individuals with disabilities move from public assistance to work through training and on-the-job accommodations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the role and impact that new technologies have on how individuals with disabilities will learn about, access, and participate in programs or services that will affect their lives; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the increased role that telecommunications play in education, employment, health care, and social activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide financial assistance to States to undertake activities that assist each State in maintaining and strengthening a permanent comprehensive statewide program of technology-related assistance, for individuals with disabilities of all ages, that is designed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increase the availability of, funding for, access to, and provision of, assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increase the active involvement of individuals with disabilities and their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, in the maintenance, improvement, and evaluation of such a program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increase the involvement of individuals with disabilities and, if appropriate, their family members, guardians, advocates, and authorized representatives, in decisions related to the provision of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) increase the provision of outreach to underrepresented populations and rural populations, to enable the two populations to enjoy the benefits of activities carried out under this chapter to the same extent as other populations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) increase and promote coordination among State agencies, between State and local agencies, among local agencies, and between State and local agencies and private entities (such as managed care providers), that are involved or are eligible to be involved in carrying out activities under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F)(i) increase the awareness of laws, regulations, policies, practices, procedures, and organizational structures, that facilitate the availability or provision of assistive technology devices and assistive technology services; and</p>
