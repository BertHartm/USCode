<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rules governing single-employer plan terminations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exclusive means of plan termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of a termination for which proceedings are otherwise instituted by the corporation as provided in section 1342 of this title, a single-employer plan may be terminated only in a standard termination under subsection (b) of this section or a distress termination under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 60-day notice of intent to terminate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not less than 60 days before the proposed termination date of a standard termination under subsection (b) of this section or a distress termination under subsection (c) of this section, the plan administrator shall provide to each affected party (other than the corporation in the case of a standard termination) a written notice of intent to terminate stating that such termination is intended and the proposed termination date. The written notice shall include any related additional information required in regulations of the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adherence to collective bargaining agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The corporation shall not proceed with a termination of a plan under this section if the termination would violate the terms and conditions of an existing collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the authority of the corporation to institute proceedings to involuntarily terminate a plan under section 1342 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standard termination of single-employer plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A single-employer plan may terminate under a standard termination only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">As soon as practicable after the date on which the notice of intent to terminate is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation setting forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) certification by an enrolled actuary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) of the projected amount of the assets of the plan (as of a proposed date of final distribution of assets),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) of the actuarial present value (as of such date) of the benefit liabilities (determined as of the proposed termination date) under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) that the plan is projected to be sufficient (as of such proposed date of final distribution) for such benefit liabilities,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice from the corporation of noncompliance</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Within 60 days after receipt of the notice under subparagraph (A), the corporation shall issue a notice of noncompliance to the plan administrator if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it determines, based on the notice sent under paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (b) of this section, that there is reason to believe that the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) it determines that any other requirement of subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph or of subsection (a)(2) of this section has not been met, unless it further determines that the issuance of such notice would be inconsistent with the interests of participants and beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The corporation and the plan administrator may agree to extend the 60-day period referred to in clause (i) by a written agreement signed by the corporation and the plan administrator before the expiration of the 60-day period. The 60-day period shall be extended as provided in the agreement and may be further extended by subsequent written agreements signed by the corporation and the plan administrator made before the expiration of a previously agreed upon extension of the 60-day period. Any extension may be made upon such terms and conditions (including the payment of benefits) as are agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Final distribution of assets in absence of notice of noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The plan administrator shall commence the final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan as soon as practicable after the expiration of the 60-day (or extended) period referred to in subparagraph (C), but such final distribution may occur only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the plan administrator has not received during such period a notice of noncompliance from the corporation under subparagraph (C), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) when such final distribution occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Methods of final distribution of assets</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In connection with any final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall distribute the assets in accordance with section 1344 of this title. In distributing such assets, the plan administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) purchase irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan. A transfer of assets to the corporation in accordance with section 1350 of this title on behalf of a missing participant shall satisfy this subparagraph with respect to such participant.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification to the corporation of final distribution of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 30 days after the final distribution of assets is completed pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation certifying that the assets of the plan have been distributed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) so as to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Continuing authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the continued exercise by the cor<!-- PDFPage:531 -->poration, after the termination date of a plan terminated in a standard termination under this subsection, of its authority under section 1303 of this title with respect to matters relating to the termination. A certification under paragraph (3)(B) shall not affect the corporation's obligations under section 1322 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rule for certain plans where cessation or change in membership of a controlled group</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">then the interest rate used in determining whether the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities or to otherwise assess plan liabilities for purposes of this subsection or section 1342(a)(4) of this title shall be not less than the interest rate used in determining whether the plan is fully funded.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any transaction or series of transactions unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any employer maintaining the plan immediately before or after such transaction or series of transactions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) has an outstanding senior unsecured debt instrument which is rated investment grade by each of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations for corporate bonds that has issued a credit rating for such instrument, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if no such debt instrument of such employer has been rated by such an organization but 1 or more of such organizations has made an issuer credit rating for such employer, all such organizations which have so rated the employer have rated such employer investment grade, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the employer maintaining the plan after the transaction or series of transactions employs at least 20 percent of the employees located in the United States who were employed by such employer immediately before the transaction or series of transactions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a transaction or series of transactions which occur in a plan year beginning before January 1, 2008, the funded current liability percentage determined under section 1082(d) of this title for the plan year is at least 100 percent, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) 2 year limitation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation, and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Cases of sufficiency for guaranteed benefits without a finding of sufficiency for benefit liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits, but further determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities on the basis of the information made available to it, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan's assets in the manner described in subsection (b)(3) of this section, make certification to the corporation that the distribution has occurred, and take such actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Cases without any finding of sufficiency</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:534 --><h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The requirements of this clause are met by the plan administrator if the plan administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) refrains from distributing assets or taking any other actions to carry out the proposed termination under this subsection,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) pays benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) does not use plan assets to purchase irrevocable commitments to provide benefits from an insurer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) continues to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan, but, commencing on the proposed termination date, limits the payment of benefits under the plan to those benefits which are guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title or to which assets are required to be allocated under section 1344 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In the event the plan administrator is later determined not to have met the requirements for distress termination, any benefits which are not paid solely by reason of compliance with subclause (IV) shall be due and payable immediately (together with interest, at a reasonable rate, in accordance with regulations of the corporation).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The adoption of an amendment to a plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title constitutes a termination of the plan.
