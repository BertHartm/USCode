<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is a reasonable expectation that the individual considered for selection can participate successfully in group situations and activities, and is not likely to engage in behavior that would prevent other enrollees from receiving the benefit of the Job Corps program or be incompatible with the maintenance of sound discipline and satisfactory relationships between the Job Corps center to which the individual might be assigned and communities surrounding the Job Corps center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the individual manifests a basic understanding of both the rules to which the individual will be subject and of the consequences of failure to observe the rules; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the enrollee chooses a vocational training program, or requires an English literacy program, that is not available at such center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the enrollee would be unduly delayed in participating in the Job Corps program because the closest center is operating at full capacity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the parent or guardian of the enrollee requests assignment of the enrollee to another Job Corps center due to circumstances in the community of the enrollee that would impair prospects for successful participation in the Job Corps program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Enrollees who are younger than 18</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enrollee who is younger than 18 shall not be assigned to a Job Corps center other than the center closest to the home of the enrollee pursuant to paragraph (1) if the parent or guardian of the enrollee objects to the assignment.</p>
