<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of plan sponsor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless otherwise provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, a plan sponsor may not cause a multiemployer plan to merge with one or more multiemployer plans, or engage in a transfer of assets and liabilities to or from another multiemployer plan, unless such merger or transfer satisfies the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A merger or transfer satisfies the requirements of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in accordance with regulations of the corporation, the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan notifies the corporation of a merger with or transfer of plan assets or liabilities to another multiemployer plan at least 120 days before the effective date of the merger or transfer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no participant's or beneficiary's accrued benefit will be lower immediately after the effective date of the merger or transfer than the benefit immediately before that date;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the benefits of participants and beneficiaries are not reasonably expected to be subject to suspension under section 1426 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of each of the affected plans has been performed during the plan year preceding the effective date of the merger or transfer, based upon the most recent data available as of the day before the start of that plan year, or other valuation of such assets and liabilities performed under such standards and procedures as the corporation may prescribe by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Actions not deemed violation of section 1106(a) or (b)(2) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The merger of multiemployer plans or the transfer of assets or liabilities between multiemployer plans, shall be deemed not to constitute a violation of the provisions of section 1106(a) of this title or section 1106(b)(2) of this title if the corporation determines that the merger or transfer otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nature of plan to which liabilities are transferred</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan to which liabilities are transferred under this section is a successor plan for purposes of section 1322a(b)(2)(B) of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1412. Transfers between a multiemployer plan and a single-employer plan</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A transfer of assets or liabilities between, or a merger of, a multiemployer plan and a single-employer plan shall satisfy the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Accrued benefit of participant or beneficiary not lower immediately after effective date of transfer or merger</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No accrued benefit of a participant or beneficiary may be lower immediately after the effective date of a transfer or merger described in subsection (a) of this section than the benefit immediately before that date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability of multiemployer plan to corporation where single-employer plan terminates within 60 months after effective date of transfer; amount of liability, exemption, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a multiemployer plan which transfers liabilities to a single-employer plan shall be liable to the corporation if the single-employer plan terminates within 60 months after the effective date of the transfer. The amount of liability shall be the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of the plan asset insufficiency of the terminated single-employer plan, less 30 percent of the net worth of the employer who maintained the single-employer plan, determined in accordance with section 1362 or 1364 this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the value, on the effective date of the transfer, of the unfunded benefits transferred to the single-employer plan which are guaranteed under section 1322 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A multiemployer plan shall be liable to the corporation as provided in paragraph (1) unless, within 180 days after the corporation receives an application (together with such information as the corporation may reasonably require for purposes of such application) from the multiemployer plan sponsor for a determination under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the corporation determines that the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries and of the corporation are adequately protected, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) fails to make any determination regarding the adequacy with which such interests are protected with respect to such transfer of liabilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If, after the receipt of such application, the corporation requests from the plan sponsor additional information necessary for the determination, the running of the 180-day period shall be suspended from the date of such request until the receipt by the corporation of the additional information requested. The corporation may by regulation prescribe procedures and standards for the issuance of determinations under this paragraph. This paragraph shall not apply to any application submitted less than 180 days after September 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A multiemployer plan shall not be liable to the corporation as provided in paragraph (1) in the case of a transfer from the multiemployer plan to a single-employer plan of liabilities which accrued under a single-employer plan which merged with the multiemployer plan, if, the value of liabilities transferred to the single-employer plan does not exceed the value of the liabilities for benefits which accrued before the merger, and the value of the assets transferred to the single-employer plan is substantially equal to the value of the assets which would have been in the single-employer plan if the employer had maintained and funded it as a separate plan under which no benefits accrued after the date of the merger.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation may make equitable arrangements with multiemployer plans which are liable under this subsection for satisfaction of their liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee of benefits under single-employer plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Benefits under a single-employer plan to which liabilities are transferred in accordance with this section are guaranteed under section 1322 of this title to the extent provided in that section as of the effective date of the transfer and the plan is a successor plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfer of liabilities by multiemployer plan to single-employer plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), a multiemployer plan may not transfer liabilities to a single-employer plan unless the plan sponsor of the plan to which the liabilities would be transferred agrees to the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a transfer described in subsection (c)(3) of this section, paragraph (1) of this subsection is satisfied by the advance agreement to the transfer by the employer who will be obligated to contribute to the single-employer plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional requirements by corporation for protection of interests of plan participants, beneficiaries and corporation; approval by corporation of transfer of assets or liabilities to single-employer plan from plan in reorganization; covered transfers in connection with termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may prescribe by regulation such additional requirements with respect to the transfer of assets or liabilities as may be necessary to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries and the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise determined by the corporation, a transfer of assets or liabilities to a single-employer plan from a plan in reorganization under section 1421 of this title is not effective unless the corporation approves such transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No transfer to which this section applies, in connection with a termination described in section 1341a(a)(2) of this title shall be effective unless the transfer meets such requirements as may be established by the corporation to prevent an increase in the risk of loss to the corporation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to transfer from old plan to new plan pursuant to employee participation in another multiemployer plan after certified change of representative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which an employer has completely or partially withdrawn from a multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;old plan&rdquo;) as a result of a certified change of collective bargaining representative occurring after September 25, 1980, if participants of the old plan who are employed by the employer will, as a result of that change, participate in another multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;new plan&rdquo;), the old plan shall transfer assets and liabilities to the new plan in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification by employer of plan sponsor of old plan; notification by plan sponsor of old plan of employer and plan sponsor of new plan; appeal by new plan to prevent transfer; further proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The employer shall notify the plan sponsor of the old plan of a change in multiemployer plan participation described in subsection (a) of this section no later than 30 days after the employer determines that the change will occur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan sponsor of the old plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the employer of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the withdrawal,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:547 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the old plan's intent to transfer to the new plan the nonforfeitable benefits of the employees who are no longer working in covered service under the old plan as a result of the change of bargaining representative, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the amount of assets and liabilities which are to be transferred to the new plan, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the plan sponsor of the new plan of the benefits, assets, and liabilities which will be transferred to the new plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(B), the new plan may file an appeal with the corporation to prevent the transfer. The transfer shall not be made if the corporation determines that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer. Upon notification described in paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer fails to object to the transfer within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(A), or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities to the new plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduction of amount of withdrawal liability of employer upon transfer of appropriate amount of assets and liabilities by plan sponsor of old plan to new plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the plan sponsor of the old plan transfers the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities under this section to the new plan, then the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability (as determined under section 1381(b) of this title without regard to such transfer and this section) with respect to the old plan shall be reduced by the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the value of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer which were transferred by the plan sponsor of the old plan to the new plan, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of the assets transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Escrow payments by employer upon complete or partial withdrawal and prior to transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which there is a complete or partial withdrawal described in subsection (a) of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the new plan files an appeal with the corporation under subsection (b)(3) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the employer is required by section 1399 of this title to begin making payments of withdrawal liability before the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date on which the corporation finds that the new plan would not suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the employer shall make such payments into an escrow held by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the old plan. If the transfer is made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be returned to the employer. If the transfer is not made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be paid to the old plan and credited against the employer's withdrawal liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition on transfer of assets to new plan by plan sponsor of old plan; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the plan sponsor shall not transfer any assets to the new plan if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the old plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the transfer of assets would cause the old plan to go into reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which a transfer of assets from the old plan to the new plan is prohibited by paragraph (1), the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all nonforfeitable benefits described in subsection (b)(2) of this section, if the value of such benefits does not exceed the withdrawal liability of the employer with respect to such withdrawal, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such nonforfeitable benefits having a value equal to the withdrawal liability of the employer, if the value of such benefits exceeds the withdrawal liability of the employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agreement between plan sponsors of old plan and new plan to transfer in compliance with other statutory provisions; reduction of withdrawal liability of employer from old plan; amount of withdrawal liability of employer to new plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (e) of this section, the plan sponsors of the old plan and the new plan may agree to a transfer of assets and liabilities that complies with sections 1411 and 1414 of this title, rather than this section, except that the employer's liability with respect to the withdrawal from the old plan shall be reduced under subsection (c) of this section as if assets and liabilities had been transferred in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the employer withdraws from the new plan within 240 months after the effective date of a transfer of assets and liabilities described in this section, the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the new plan shall be the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the new plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount by which the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan was reduced under subsection (c) of this section, reduced by 5 percent for each 12-month period following the effective date of the transfer and ending before the date of the withdrawal from the new plan.</p>
