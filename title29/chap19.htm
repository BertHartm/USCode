<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1516. Performance standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that job training is an investment in human capital and not an expense. In order to determine whether that investment has been productive, the Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is essential that criteria for measuring the return on this investment be developed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the basic return on the investment is to be measured by long-term economic self-sufficiency, increased employment and earnings, reductions in welfare dependency, and increased educational attainment and occupational skills.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subchapter II performance standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing performance standards for programs under parts A and C of subchapter II of this chapter, the Secretary shall ensure that States and service delivery areas will make efforts to increase services and positive outcomes for hard-to-serve individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Achievement of basic measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to determine whether the basic measures described in subsection (a) of this section are achieved for programs under parts A and C of subchapter II of this chapter, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall prescribe performance standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Factors for adult standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall base the performance standards for adult programs under part A of <!-- PDFPage:574 -->subchapter II of this chapter on appropriate factors, which may include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) retention for not less than 6 months in unsubsidized employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an increase in earnings, including hourly wages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a reduction in welfare dependency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) acquisition of skills, including basic skills, required to promote continued employability in the local labor market (including attainment of the competency levels described in paragraph (5)), or acquisition of a high school diploma or the equivalent of the diploma, if the acquisition of such skills or diploma is in addition to obtaining one or more of the outcomes described in subparagraphs (A) through (D).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Factors for youth standards</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall base the performance standards for youth programs under part C of subchapter II of this chapter on appropriate factors described in paragraph (3), and on factors including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) dropout prevention and recovery;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Variations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may prescribe variations in the standards described in subparagraph (A) to reflect the differences between in-school and out-of-school programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Competency levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The private industry councils, in consultation with appropriate educational agencies, and, where appropriate, the private sector, labor organizations, and community-based organizations, shall establish youth and adult competency levels, based on such factors as entry level skills and other hiring requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The performance standards described in paragraphs (3) and (4) shall include provisions governing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the base period prior to program participation that will be used for measurement of the factors in such paragraphs, as appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a representative period after termination from the program that is a reasonable indicator of postprogram employment, earnings, and cash welfare payment reductions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) cost-effective methods for obtaining such data as are necessary to carry out this section and section 1732(d) of this title which, notwithstanding any other provision of law, may include access to earnings records, State employment security records, records collected under the Federal Insurance Contributions Act (chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) [26 U.S.C. 3101 et seq.], records collected under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.], statistical sampling techniques, and similar records or measures, with appropriate safeguards to protect the confidentiality of the information obtained.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a brokering contractor enters into a contract with a subcontractor to provide training or other services, the brokering contractor shall ensure, through on-site monitoring, compliance with subcontract terms prior to making payment to the subcontractor.</p>

The Comptroller General shall conduct the evaluations whenever he determines it necessary and he shall periodically report to the Congress on the findings of such evaluations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to relieve the Inspector General of the Department of Labor of his responsibilities under the Inspector General Act.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recipient's liability for noncomplying expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every recipient shall repay to the United States amounts found not to have been expended in accordance with this chapter. The Secretary may offset such amounts against any other amount to which the recipient is or may be entitled under this chapter unless he determines that such recipient should be held liable pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. No such action shall be taken except after notice and opportunity for a hearing have been given to the recipient.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines that the recipient has demonstrated substantial compliance with the requirements of paragraph (2), the Secretary may waive the imposition of sanctions authorized by this section upon such recipient. The Secretary is authorized to impose any sanction consistent with the provisions of this chapter and any applicable Federal or State law directly against any subgrantee for violation of this chapter or the regulations under this chapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:598 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Emergency situations and immediate termination</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that (1) serious unemployment and economic disadvantages exist among members of Indian, Alaskan Native, and Hawaiian Native communities; (2) there is a compelling need for the establishment of comprehensive training and employment programs for members of those communities; and (3) such programs are essential to the reduction of economic disadvantages among individual members of those communities and to the advancement of economic and social development in the communities consistent with their goals and lifestyles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional declaration of guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress therefore declares that, because of the special relationship between the Federal Government and most of the individuals to be served by the provisions of this section, (1) such programs shall be administered at the national level; (2) such programs shall be available to federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, and groups and to other groups and individuals of Native American descent; and (3) such programs shall be administered in such a manner as to maximize the Federal commitment to support growth and development as determined by representatives of the communities and groups served by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Operation through Native American organizations where possible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In carrying out responsibilities under this section, the Secretary shall, wherever possible, utilize Indian tribes, bands, or groups on Federal or State reservations, Oklahoma Indians, and including for the purpose of this chapter, Alaska Native villages or groups as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], having a governing body for the provision of employment and training services under this section. When the Secretary determines that such tribe, band, or group has demonstrated the capability to effectively administer a comprehensive employment and training program, the Secretary shall require such tribe, band, or group to submit a comprehensive plan meeting such requirements as the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall arrange for programs to meet the employment and training needs of Hawaiian natives through such organizations as the Secretary determines will best meet their needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out responsibilities under this section, the Secretary shall make arrangements with organizations (meeting requirements prescribed by the Secretary) serving nonreservation Native Americans for programs and projects designed to meet the needs of such Native Americans for employment and training and related services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternative operation through approved organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary determines not to utilize Indian tribes, bands, or groups for the provision of employment and training services under this section, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent feasible, enter into arrangements for the provision of such services with organizations which meet with the approval of the tribes, bands, or groups to be served.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Monitoring of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is directed to take appropriate action to establish administrative procedures and machinery (including personnel having particular competence in this field) for the selection, administration, monitoring, and evaluation of Native American employment and training programs authorized under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Availability of funds for other job training activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds available for this section shall be expended for programs and activities consistent with the purposes of this section including but not limited to such programs and activities carried out by recipients under other provisions of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, after consultation with representatives of Indians and other Native Americans, prescribe such rules, regulations, and performance standards pursuant to section 1516 of this title relating to Native American programs under this section as may be required to meet the special circumstances under which such programs operate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Recipients of funds under this section shall establish performance goals, which shall, to the extent required by the Secretary, comply with performance standards established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1516 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Technical assistance to Native American organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide technical assistance as necessary to tribes, bands, and groups eligible for assistance under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Organizational unit responsible for administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall designate a single organizational unit that shall have as its primary <!-- PDFPage:643 -->responsibility the administration of all Native American programs authorized under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such organizational unit shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be responsible for administering the provisions of the Native American programs authorized under this chapter, including monitoring such programs and making recommendations regarding the selection of the recipients of financial assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be responsible for the development of the policies and procedures related to the implementation of such programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) coordinate the development of policy and procedures for the employment and training programs within the Department relating to services for Native American workers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the hiring and promotion of the professional staff for the organizational unit designated under paragraph (1), special consideration shall be given to individuals who have field experience in the daily operation of service and training programs for Native Americans, and individuals who are Indians or Alaskan Natives.

Such allowances shall be graduated up to the maximum so as to encourage continued participation in the program, achievement and the best use by the enrollee of the funds so provided and shall be subject to reduction in appropriate cases as a disciplinary measure. To the degree reasonable, enrollees shall be required to meet or contribute to costs associated with their individual comfort and enjoyment from their personal allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules governing leave</h4>

No enrollee shall be entitled to a readjustment allowance unless he has remained in the program at least 90 days, except in unusual circumstances as determined by the Secretary. The Secretary may, from time to time, advance to or on behalf of an enrollee such portions of his readjustment allowances as the Secretary deems necessary to meet extraordinary financial obligations incurred by that enrollee. The Secretary is authorized, pursuant to rules or regulations, <!-- PDFPage:650 -->to reduce the amount of an enrollee's readjustment allowance as a penalty for misconduct during participation in the Job Corps. In the event of an enrollee's death during his period of service, the amount of any unpaid readjustment allowance shall be paid in accordance with the provisions of section 5582 of title 5.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) The total amount that may be paid to an employer on behalf of a veteran participating in a program of job training under this Act is $10,000.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) In order to relieve financial burdens on business enterprises with relatively few numbers of employees, the Administrator may make payments under this Act on a monthly, rather than quarterly, basis to an employer with a number of employees less than a number which shall be specified in regulations which the Administrator shall prescribe for the purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Payment may not be made to an employer for a period of training under this Act on behalf of a veteran until the Administrator has received&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) Whenever the Administrator finds that an employer has failed in any substantial respect to comply for a period of time with a requirement established under this Act (unless the employer's failure is the result of false or incomplete information provided by the veteran), each amount paid to the employer on behalf of a veteran for that period shall be considered to be an overpayment under this Act, and the amount of such overpayment shall constitute a liability of the employer to the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Whenever the Administrator finds that an overpayment under this Act has been made to an employer on behalf of a veteran as a result of a certification by the veteran, or as a result of information provided to an employer or contained in an application submitted by the veteran, which was willfully or negligently false in any material respect, the amount of such overpayment shall constitute a liability of the veteran to the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Any overpayment referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) may be recovered in the same manner as any other debt due the United States.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the Administrator may withhold or deny approval of a veteran's entry into an approved program of job training if the Administrator determines that funds are not available to make payments under this Act on behalf of the veteran to the employer offering that program. Before the entry of a veteran into an approved program of job training of an employer for purposes of assistance under this Act, the employer shall notify the Administrator of the employer's intention to employ that veteran. The veteran may begin such program of job training with the employer two weeks after the notice is transmitted to the Administrator unless within that time the employer has received notice from the Administrator that approval of the veteran's entry into that program of job training must be withheld or denied in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;provision of training through educational institutions</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>&ldquo;Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. An employer may enter into an agreement with an educational institution that has been approved for the enrollment of veterans under chapter 34 of title 38, United States Code, in order that such institution may provide a program of job training (or a portion of such a program) under this Act. When such an agreement has been entered into, the application of the employer under section 7 shall so state and shall include a description of the training to be provided under the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;discontinuance of approval of participation in certain employer programs</h4>

The Administrator shall provide to the employer concerned, and to each veteran participating in the employer's program, a statement of the reasons for, and an opportunity for a hearing with respect to, such disapproval. The employer and each such veteran shall be notified of such disapproval, the reasons for such disapproval, and the opportunity for a hearing. Notification shall be by a certified or registered letter, and a return receipt shall be secured.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b)(1) If the Administrator determines that the rate of veterans&rsquo; successful completion of an employer's programs of job training previously approved by the Administrator for the purposes of this Act is disproportionately low because of deficiencies in the quality of such programs, the Administrator shall disapprove participation in such programs on the part of veterans who had not begun such participation on the date that the employer is notified of the disapproval. In determining whether any such rate is disproportionately low because of such deficiencies, the Administrator shall take into account appropriate data, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Department of Labor, shall promulgate regulations setting forth how the Office will determine, during a compliance review, the degree to which a training program will satisfy the contractor's affirmative action obligations. The training and placement of trainees with employers other than the contractor may be considered in evaluating such contractor's overall good faith efforts, but in no event may placement of trainees with employers other than the contractor be permitted to affect that contractor's affirmative action obligations respecting its work force.

Successful performance or operation of a training program meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall create a presumption that the contractor has made a good faith effort to meet its affirmative action obligations to the degree specified by the Director under paragraph (2) of this subsection, but that presumption shall not be applicable to the satisfaction of other affirmative action obligations not directly related to the training and hiring requirements of this section, or other affirmative action obligations not affected by this section.
