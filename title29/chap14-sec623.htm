<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) if a participant's accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the terms of the plan, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual who is or could be a participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Similarly situated</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, a participant is similarly situated to any other individual if such participant is identical to such other individual in every respect (including period of service, compensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other respect) except for age.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for plan conversions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after June 29, 2005, an applicable plan amendment is adopted, the plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the requirements of clause (iii) are met with respect to each individual who was a participant in the plan immediately before the adoption of the amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the participant's accrued benefit for years of service before the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect before the amendment, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the participant's accrued benefit for years of service after the effective date of the amendment, determined under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) <cap-smallcap>Applicable plan amendment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;applicable plan amendment&rdquo; means an amendment to a defined benefit plan which has the effect of converting the plan to an applicable defined benefit plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for coordinated benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the benefits of 2 or more defined benefit plans established or maintained by an employer are coordinated in such a <!-- PDFPage:134 -->manner as to have the effect of the adoption of an amendment described in subclause (I), the sponsor of the defined benefit plan or plans providing for such coordination shall be treated as having adopted such a plan amendment as of the date such coordination begins.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) <cap-smallcap>Multiple amendments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this subparagraph through the use of 2 or more plan amendments rather than a single amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) <cap-smallcap>Applicable defined benefit plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;applicable defined benefit plan&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 1053(f)(3) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) <cap-smallcap>Termination requirements</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An applicable defined benefit plan shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) unless the plan provides that, upon the termination of the plan&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the interest rate and mortality table used to determine the amount of any benefit under the plan payable in the form of an annuity payable at normal retirement age shall be the rate and table specified under the plan for such purpose as of the termination date, except that if such interest rate is a variable rate, the interest rate shall be determined under the rules of subclause (I).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Certain offsets permitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) solely because the plan provides offsets against benefits under the plan to the extent such offsets are allowable in applying the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Permitted disparities in plan contributions or benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) solely because the plan provides a disparity in contributions or benefits with respect to which the requirements of section 401(<em>l</em>) of title 26 are met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Indexing permitted.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1) solely because the plan provides for indexing of accrued benefits under the plan.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph, the terms &ldquo;early retirement benefit&rdquo; and &ldquo;retirement-type subsidy&rdquo; have the meaning given such terms in section 1054(g)(2)(A) of this title.<sup><a href="#623_2_target" name="623_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Benefit accrued to date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph, any reference to the accrued benefit shall be a reference to such benefit accrued to date.</p>
