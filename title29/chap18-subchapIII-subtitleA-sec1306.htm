<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Schedules for premium rates and bases for application; establishment, coverage, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation shall prescribe such schedules of premium rates and bases for the application of those rates as may be necessary to provide sufficient revenue to the fund for the corporation to carry out its functions under this subchapter. The premium rates charged by the corporation for any period shall be uniform for all plans, other than multiemployer plans, insured by the corporation with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title, and shall be uniform for all multiemployer plans with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation shall maintain separate schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation may revise such schedules whenever it determines that revised schedules are necessary. Except as provided in section 1322a(f) of this title, in order to place a revised schedule described in subparagraph (A) or (B) in effect, the corporation shall proceed in accordance with subsection (b)(1) of this section, and such schedule shall apply only to plan years beginning more than 30 days after the date on which a joint resolution approving such revised schedule is enacted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of a single-employer plan, for plan years beginning after December 31, 2005, an amount equal to the sum of $30 plus the additional premium (if any) determined under subparagraph (E) for each individual who is a participant in such plan during the plan year;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1306_1_target" name="1306_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, for the plan year within which the date of enactment of the Multiemployer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980 falls, an amount for each individual who is a participant in such plan for such plan year equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) 50 cents, multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of months in such year ending on or before such date and the denominator of which is 12, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) $1.00, multiplied by a fraction equal to 1 minus the fraction determined under clause (i),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, for plan years beginning after September 26, 1980, and before January 1, 2006, an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation the extent to which the rate described in subparagraph (A)(i) applies more than once for any plan year to an individual participating in more than one plan maintained by the same employer, and the corporation may prescribe regulations under which the rate described in clause (iii) or (iv) of subparagraph (A) will not apply to the same participant in any multiemployer plan more than once for any plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) If the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">is for any calendar year less than 2 times the amount of basic benefits guaranteed by the corporation under this subchapter for multiemployer plans which were paid out of any such fund or assets during the preceding calendar year, the annual premium rates under subparagraph (A) shall be increased to the next highest premium level necessary to insure that such sum will be at least 2 times greater than such amount during the following calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the board of directors of the corporation determines that an increase in the premium rates under subparagraph (A) is necessary to provide assistance to plans which are receiving assistance under section 1431 of this title and to plans the board finds are reasonably likely to require such assistance, the board may order such increase in the premium rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The maximum annual premium rate which may be established under this subparagraph is $2.60 for each participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply if the annual premium rate is increased to a level in excess of $2.60 per participant under any other provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Not later than 120 days before the date on which an increase under subparagraph (C)(ii) is to become effective, the corporation shall publish in the Federal Register a notice of the determination described in subparagraph (C)(ii), the basis for the determination, the amount of the increase in the premium, and the anticipated increase in premium income that would result from the increase in the premium rate. The notice shall invite public comment, and shall provide for a public hearing if one is requested. Any such hearing shall be commenced not later than 60 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The board of directors shall review the hearing record established under clause (i) and shall, not later than 30 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective, determine (after consideration of the comments received) whether the amount of the increase should be changed and shall publish its determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (H), the additional premium determined under this subparagraph with respect to any plan for any plan year shall be an amount equal to the amount determined under clause (ii) divided by the number of participants in such plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The amount determined under this clause for any plan year shall be an amount equal to <!-- PDFPage:508 -->$9.00 for each $1,000 (or fraction thereof) of unfunded vested benefits under the plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For purposes of clause (ii), the term &ldquo;unfunded vested benefits&rdquo; means, for a plan year, the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the funding target of the plan as determined under section 1083(d) of this title for the plan year by only taking into account vested benefits and by using the interest rate described in clause (iv), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the fair market value of plan assets for the plan year which are held by the plan on the valuation date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The interest rate used in valuing benefits for purposes of subclause (I) of clause (iii) shall be equal to the first, second, or third segment rate for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins, which would be determined under section 1083(h)(2)(C) of this title if section 1083(h)(2)(D) of this title were applied by using the monthly yields for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins on investment grade corporate bonds with varying maturities and in the top 3 quality levels rather than the average of such yields for a 24-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) For each plan year beginning in a calendar year after 2006, there shall be substituted for the premium rate specified in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the product derived by multiplying the premium rate specified in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) by the ratio of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the national average wage index (as defined in section 409(k)(1) of title 42) for the first of the 2 calendar years preceding the calendar year in which such plan year begins, to</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the premium rate in effect under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) for plan years beginning in the preceding calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the amount determined under this subparagraph is not a multiple of $1, such product shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) For each plan year beginning in a calendar year after 2006, there shall be substituted for the premium rate specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the product derived by multiplying the premium rate specified in clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) by the ratio of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the national average wage index (as defined in section 409(k)(1) of title 42) for the first of the 2 calendar years preceding the calendar year in which such plan year begins, to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the national average wage index (as so defined) for 2004; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the premium rate in effect under clause (iv) of subparagraph (A) for plan years beginning in the preceding calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the amount determined under this subparagraph is not a multiple of $1, such product shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) In the case of an employer who has 25 or fewer employees on the first day of the plan year, the additional premium determined under subparagraph (E) for each participant shall not exceed $5 multiplied by the number of participants in the plan as of the close of the preceding plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), whether an employer has 25 or fewer employees on the first day of the plan year is determined by taking into consideration all of the employees of all members of the contributing sponsor's controlled group. In the case of a plan maintained by two or more contributing sponsors, the employees of all contributing sponsors and their controlled groups shall be aggregated for purposes of determining whether the 25-or-fewer-employees limitation has been satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation may prescribe, subject to the enactment of a joint resolution in accordance with this section or section 1322a(f) of this title, alternative schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for basic benefits guaranteed by it under sections 1322 and 1322a of this title based, in whole or in part, on the risks insured by the corporation in each plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) In carrying out its authority under paragraph (1) to establish schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for nonbasic benefits guaranteed under sections 1322 and 1322a of this title the premium rates charged by the corporation for any period for nonbasic benefits guaranteed shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) be uniform by category of nonbasic benefits guaranteed,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) be based on the risks insured in each category, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) reflect the experience of the corporation (including experience which may be reasonably anticipated) in guaranteeing such benefits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), premium rates charged to any multiemployer plan by the corporation for any period for supplemental guarantees under section 1322a(g)(2) of this title may reflect any reasonable considerations which the corporation determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) In carrying out its authority under paragraph (1) to establish premium rates and bases for basic benefits guaranteed under section 1322 of this title with respect to single-employer plans, the corporation shall establish such rates and bases in coverage schedules in accordance with the provisions of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may establish annual premiums for single-employer plans composed of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a charge based on a rate applicable to the excess, if any, of the present value of the basic benefits of the plan which are guaranteed over the value of the assets of the plan, not in excess of 0.1 percent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an additional charge based on a rate applicable to the present value of the basic benefits of the plan which are guaranteed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The rate for the additional charge referred to in clause (ii) shall be set by the corporation for every year at a level which the corporation estimates will yield total revenue approximately equal to the total revenue to be derived by the <!-- PDFPage:509 -->corporation from the charges referred to in clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The corporation may establish annual premiums for single-employer plans based on&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) unfunded basic benefits guaranteed under this subchapter, but such premium rates shall not exceed the limitations applicable to charges referred to in subparagraph (B)(i), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) total guaranteed basic benefits, but such premium rates shall not exceed the rates for additional charges referred to in subparagraph (B)(ii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the corporation uses two or more of the rate bases described in this subparagraph, the premium rates shall be designed to produce approximately equal amounts of aggregate premium revenue from each of the rate bases used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the corporation shall by regulation define the terms &ldquo;value of assets&rdquo; and &ldquo;present value of the benefits of the plan which are guaranteed&rdquo; in a manner consistent with the purposes of this subchapter and the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to place a revised schedule (other than a schedule described in subsection (a)(2)(C), (D), or (E) of this section) in effect, the corporation shall transmit the proposed schedule, its proposed effective date, and the reasons for its proposal to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives, and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The succeeding paragraphs of this subsection are enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of resolutions described in paragraph (3). They shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; means only a joint resolution, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &ldquo;The proposed revised schedule transmitted to Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; is hereby approved.&rdquo;, the blank space therein being filled with the date on which the corporation's message proposing the rate was delivered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A resolution shall be referred to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If a committee to which has been referred a resolution has not reported it before the expiration of 10 calendar days after its introduction, it shall then (but not before) be in order to move to discharge the committee from further consid<!-- PDFPage:510 -->eration of that resolution, or to discharge the committee from further consideration of any other resolution with respect to the proposed adjustment which has been referred to the committee. The motion to discharge may be made only by a person favoring the resolution, shall be highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution with respect to the same proposed rate), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed, nor may another motion to discharge the committee be made with respect to any other resolution with respect to the same proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) When a committee has reported, or has been discharged from further consideration of a resolution, it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. Debate on the resolution shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Motions to postpone, made with respect to the discharge from committee, or the consideration of, a resolution and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business shall be decided without debate. Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution shall be decided without debate.</p>
