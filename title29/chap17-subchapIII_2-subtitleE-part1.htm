<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, a complete withdrawal from a multiemployer plan occurs when an employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Building and construction industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the building and construction industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) substantially all the employees with respect to whom the employer has an obligation to contribute under the plan perform work in the building and construction industry, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is amended to provide that this subsection applies to employers described in this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an employer ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the employer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) resumes such work within 5 years after the date on which the obligation to contribute under the plan ceases, and does not renew the obligation at the time of the resumption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a plan terminated by mass withdrawal (within the meaning of section 1341a(a)(2) of this title), paragraph (2) shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;3 years&rdquo; for &ldquo;5 years&rdquo; in subparagraph (B)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Entertainment industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer that has an obligation to contribute under a plan for work performed in the entertainment industry, primarily on a temporary or project-by-project basis, if the plan primarily covers employees in the entertainment industry, a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in subsection (b)(2) of this section applied by substituting &ldquo;plan&rdquo; for &ldquo;collective bargaining agreement&rdquo; in subparagraph (B)(i) thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;entertainment industry&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) theater, motion picture (except to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation), radio, television, sound or visual recording, music, and dance, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such other entertainment activities as the corporation may determine to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation may by regulation exclude a group or class of employers described in the preceding sentence from the application of this subsection if the corporation determines that such exclusion is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to protect the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prevent a significant risk of loss to the corporation with respect to the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:517 --><p class="statutory-body">(4) A plan may be amended to provide that this subsection shall not apply to a group or class of employers under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of an employer who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has an obligation to contribute under a plan described in paragraph (2) primarily for work described in such paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) does not continue to perform work within the jurisdiction of the plan,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">a complete withdrawal occurs only as described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A plan is described in this paragraph if substantially all of the contributions required under the plan are made by employers primarily engaged in the long and short haul trucking industry, the household goods moving industry, or the public warehousing industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A withdrawal occurs under this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan or permanently ceases all covered operations under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the corporation determines that the plan has suffered substantial damage to its contribution base as a result of such cessation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the employer fails to furnish a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to 50 percent of the withdrawal liability of the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If, after an employer furnishes a bond or escrow to a plan under paragraph (3)(B)(ii), the corporation determines that the cessation of the employer's obligation to contribute under the plan (considered together with any cessations by other employers), or cessation of covered operations under the plan, has resulted in substantial damage to the contribution base of the plan, the employer shall be treated as having withdrawn from the plan on the date on which the obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased, and such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan. The corporation shall not make a determination under this paragraph more than 60 months after the date on which such obligation to contribute or covered operations ceased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the corporation determines that the employer has no further liability under the plan either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) because it determines that the contribution base of the plan has not suffered substantial damage as a result of the cessation of the employer's obligation to contribute or cessation of covered operations (considered together with any cessation of contribution obligation, or of covered operations, with respect to other employers), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) because it may not make a determination under paragraph (4) because of the last sentence thereof,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the bond shall be cancelled or the escrow refunded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as a limitation on the amount of the withdrawal liability of any employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Date of complete withdrawal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the date of a complete withdrawal is the date of the cessation of the obligation to contribute or the cessation of covered operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Special liability withdrawal rules for industries other than construction and entertainment industries; procedures applicable to amend plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may prescribe regulations under which plans in industries other than the construction or entertainment industries may be amended to provide for special withdrawal liability rules similar to the rules described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Regulations under paragraph (1) shall permit use of special withdrawal liability rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) only in industries (or portions thereof) in which, as determined by the corporation, the characteristics that would make use of such rules appropriate are clearly shown, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) only if the corporation determines, in each instance in which special withdrawal liability rules are permitted, that use of such rules will not pose a significant risk to the corporation under this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Complete or partial withdrawal not occurring as a result of sale and subsequent cessation of covered operations or cessation of obligation to contribute to covered operations; continuation of liability of seller</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;seller&rdquo;) under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm's-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo;), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the purchaser provides to the plan for a period of 5 plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the sale of assets, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the average annual contribution required to be made by the seller with respect to the operations under the plan for the 3 <!-- PDFPage:518 -->plan years preceding the plan year in which the sale of the employer's assets occurs, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the annual contribution that the seller was required to make with respect to the operations under the plan for the last plan year before the plan year in which the sale of the assets occurs,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">which bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan, or fails to make a contribution to the plan when due, at any time during the first 5 plan years beginning after the sale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract for sale provides that, if the purchaser withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations, during such first 5 plan years, the seller is secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the plan with respect to the operations (but for this section) if the liability of the purchaser with respect to the plan is not paid.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the purchaser&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year beginning after the sale, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) fails to make any withdrawal liability payment when due,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If all, or substantially all, of the seller's assets are distributed, or if the seller is liquidated before the end of the 5 plan year period described in paragraph (1)(C), then the seller shall provide a bond or amount in escrow equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability the seller would have had but for this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If only a portion of the seller's assets are distributed during such period, then a bond or escrow shall be required, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The liability of the party furnishing a bond or escrow under this subsection shall be reduced, upon payment of the bond or escrow to the plan, by the amount thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liability of purchaser</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purposes of this part, the liability of the purchaser shall be determined as if the purchaser had been required to contribute to the plan in the year of the sale and the 4 plan years preceding the sale the amount the seller was required to contribute for such operations for such 5 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the plan is in reorganization in the plan year in which the sale of assets occurs, the purchaser shall furnish a bond or escrow in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may by regulation vary the standards in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section if the variance would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Before it promulgates such regulations, the corporation may grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements of such subparagraphs if the particular case warrants it. Before granting such an individual or class variance or exemption, the corporation&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) There is a 70-percent contribution decline for any plan year if during each plan year in the 3-year testing period the employer's contribution base units do not exceed 30 percent of the employer's contribution base units for the high base year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The term &ldquo;3-year testing period&rdquo; means the period consisting of the plan year and the immediately preceding 2 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The number of contribution base units for the high base year is the average number of such units for the 2 plan years for which the employer's contribution base units were the highest within the 5 plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:519 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) There is a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation for the plan year if, during such year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all collective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute under the plan but continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required or transfers such work to another location, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan with respect to work performed at one or more but fewer than all of its facilities, but continues to perform work at the facility of the type for which the obligation to contribute ceased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a cessation of obligations under a collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered to have occurred solely because, with respect to the same plan, one agreement that requires contributions to the plan has been substituted for another agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Retail food industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of a plan in which a majority of the covered employees are employed in the retail food industry, the plan may be amended to provide that this section shall be applied with respect to such plan&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Building and construction industry; entertainment industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An employer to whom section 1383(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1388_2_target" name="1388_2">2</a></sup> of this title (relating to the building and construction industry) applies is liable for a partial withdrawal only if the employer's obligation to contribute under the plan is continued for no more than an insubstantial portion of its work in the craft and area jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions are required.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employer to whom section 1383(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1388_2_target" name="1388_2">2</a></sup> of this title (relating to the entertainment industry) applies shall have no liability for a partial withdrawal except under the conditions and to the extent prescribed by the corporation by regulation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendment of multiemployer plan for determination respecting amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan; factors determining computation of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A multiemployer plan, other than a plan which primarily covers employees in the building and construction industry, may be amended to provide that the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from the plan is an amount determined under paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, rather than under subsection (b) or (d) of this section. A plan described in section 1383(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title (relating to the building and construction industry) may be amended, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, to provide that the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer not described in section 1383(b)(1)(A) of this title shall be determined in a manner different from that provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, reduced as if those obligations were being fully amortized in level annual installments over 15 years beginning with the first plan year ending on or after such date; multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the sum of all contributions required to be made by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the sum of all contributions made for the last 5 plan years ending before September 26, 1980, by all employers who had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after September 25, 1980, and who had not withdrawn from the plan before such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the sum of the value as of such date of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected, with respect to employers withdrawing before such plan year, and that portion of the amount determined under subparagraph (B)(i) which is allocable to employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws and who also had an obligation to contribute under the plan for the first plan year ending after September 25, 1980; multiplied by</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed under the plan by the employer for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the date on which the employer withdraws, increased by the amount of any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those <!-- PDFPage:525 -->plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed by an employer who withdrew from the plan under this part during those plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws, less the value as of the end of such year of all outstanding claims for withdrawal liability which can reasonably be expected to be collected from employers withdrawing before such year; multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed by the employer under the plan for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the total amount contributed under the plan by all employers for the last 5 plan years ending before the withdrawal, increased by any employer contributions owed with respect to earlier periods which were collected in those plan years, and decreased by any amount contributed to the plan during those plan years by employers who withdrew from the plan under this section during those plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer under this paragraph is equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants&rsquo; service with the employer (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the employer's proportional share of any unfunded vested benefits which are not attributable to service with the employer or other employers who are obligated to contribute under the plan in the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws (determined as of the end of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the employer withdraws).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The plan's unfunded vested benefits which are attributable to participants&rsquo; service with the employer is the amount equal to the value of nonforfeitable benefits under the plan which are attributable to participants&rsquo; service with such employer (determined under plan rules not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation) decreased by the share of plan assets determined under subparagraph (C) which is allocated to the employer as provided under subparagraph (D).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may, by amendment, adopt any other alternative method for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of the method by the plan would not significantly increase the risk of loss to plan participants and beneficiaries or to the corporation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Unless the corporation by regulation provides otherwise, a plan may be amended to provide that a period of more than 5 but not more than 10 plan years may be used for determining the numerator and denominator of any fraction which is used under any method authorized under this section for determining an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The corporation may by regulation permit adjustments in any denominator under this section, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, where such adjustment would be appropriate to ease administrative burdens of plan sponsors in calculating such denominators.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The method of calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) of this section shall be the method for calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under a plan to which section 404(c) of title 26, or a continuation of such a plan, applies, unless the plan is amended to adopt another method authorized under subsection (b) or (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Sections 1384, 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), and 1405 of this title shall not apply with respect to the withdrawal of an employer from a plan described in paragraph (1) unless the plan is amended to provide that any of such sections apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the reason for any change in the determination of the employer's liability or schedule of liability payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment requirements; amount, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (D) of this paragraph and in paragraphs (4) and (5), an employer shall pay the amount determined under section 1391 of this title, adjusted if appropriate first under section 1389 of this title and then under section 1386 of this title over the period of years necessary to amortize the amount in level annual payments determined under subparagraph (C), calculated as if the first payment were made on the first day of the plan year following the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs and as if each subsequent payment were made on the first day of each subsequent plan year. Actual payment shall commence in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:530 --><p class="statutory-body">(ii) The determination of the amortization period described in clause (i) shall be based on the assumptions used for the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case in which the amortization period described in subparagraph (A) exceeds 20 years, the employer's liability shall be limited to the first 20 annual payments determined under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (E), the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the average annual number of contribution base units for the period of 3 consecutive plan years, during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs, in which the number of contribution base units for which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan is the highest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan during the 10 plan years ending with the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a)(1) of this title shall be deemed to occur on the last day of the first year of the 3-year testing period described in section 1385(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) A plan may be amended to provide that for any plan year ending before 1986 the amount of each annual payment shall be (in lieu of the amount determined under clause (i)) the average of the required employer contributions under the plan for the period of 3 consecutive plan years (during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending with the plan year preceding the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs) for which such required contributions were the highest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any plan year to which this clause applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) This clause shall not apply in the case of any withdrawal described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) If under a plan this clause applies to any plan year but does not apply to the next plan year, this clause shall not apply to any plan year after such next plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(V) For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;required contributions&rdquo; means, for any period, the amounts which the employer was obligated to contribute for such period (not taking into account any delinquent contribution for any other period).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) A plan may be amended to provide that for the first plan year ending on or after September 26, 1980, the number &ldquo;5&rdquo; shall be substituted for the number &ldquo;10&rdquo; each place it appears in clause (i) or clause (ii) (whichever is appropriate). If the plan is so amended, the number &ldquo;5&rdquo; shall be increased by one for each succeeding plan year until the number &ldquo;10&rdquo; is reached.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any case in which a multiemployer plan terminates by the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, or in which substantially all the employers withdraw from a plan pursuant to an agreement or arrangement to withdraw from the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the liability of each such employer who has withdrawn shall be determined (or redetermined) under this paragraph without regard to subparagraph (B), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the total unfunded vested benefits of the plan shall be fully allocated among all such employers in a manner not inconsistent with regulations which shall be prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Withdrawal by an employer from a plan, during a period of 3 consecutive plan years within which substantially all the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan withdraw, shall be presumed to be a withdrawal pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) In the case of a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a) of this title, the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount determined under subparagraph (C) (determined without regard to this subparagraph), multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the fraction determined under section 1386(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Withdrawal liability shall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor under subsection (b)(1) of this section beginning no later than 60 days after the date of the demand notwithstanding any request for review or appeal of determinations of the amount of such liability or of the schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each annual payment determined under paragraph (1)(C) shall be payable in 4 equal installments due quarterly, or at other intervals specified by plan rules. If a payment is not made when due, interest on the payment shall accrue from the due date until the date on which the payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The employer shall be entitled to prepay the outstanding amount of the unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments determined under paragraph (1)(C), plus accrued interest, if any, in whole or in part, without penalty. If the prepayment is made pursuant to a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a withdrawal described in paragraph (1)(D), the withdrawal liability of the employer shall not be limited to the amount of the prepayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the event of a default, a plan sponsor may require immediate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer's withdrawal liability, plus accrued interest on the total outstanding liability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;default&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the failure of an employer to make, when due, any payment under this section, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), interest under this subsection shall be charged at rates based on prevailing market rates for comparable obligations, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:531 --><p class="statutory-body">(7) A multiemployer plan may adopt rules for other terms and conditions for the satisfaction of an employer's withdrawal liability if such rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are consistent with this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In the case of a terminated multiemployer plan, an employer's obligation to make payments under this section ceases at the end of the plan year in which the assets of the plan (exclusive of withdrawal liability claims) are sufficient to meet all obligations of the plan, as determined by the corporation.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">The fund shall be subrogated to the rights of the plan against the employer that has withdrawn from the plan for amounts paid by a fund to a plan under&mdash;</p>
