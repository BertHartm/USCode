<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Governor of each State shall, after receiving any recommendations from the State job training coordinating council, designate substate areas for the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each service delivery area within a State shall be included within a substate area and no service delivery area shall be divided among two or more substate areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In making designations of substate areas, the Governor shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the availability of services throughout the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the capability to coordinate the delivery of services with other human services and economic development programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the geographic boundaries of labor market areas within the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), the Governor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall designate as a substate area any single service delivery area that has a population of 200,000 or more;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:627 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall designate as a substate area any two or more contiguous service delivery areas&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that in the aggregate have a population of 200,000 or more; and</p>

Whenever a substate area is represented by more than one such official or council, the respective officials and councils shall each designate representatives, in accordance with procedures established by the Governor (after consultation with the State job training coordinating council), to negotiate such agreement. In the event agreement cannot be reached on the selection of a substate grantee, the Governor shall select the substate grantee.</p>
