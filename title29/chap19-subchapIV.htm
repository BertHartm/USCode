<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that (1) serious unemployment and economic disadvantages exist among members of Indian, Alaskan Native, and Hawaiian Native communities; (2) there is a compelling need for the establishment of comprehensive training and employment programs for members of those communities; and (3) such programs are essential to the reduction of economic disadvantages among individual members of those communities and to the advancement of economic and social development in the communities consistent with their goals and lifestyles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional declaration of guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress therefore declares that, because of the special relationship between the Federal Government and most of the individuals to be served by the provisions of this section, (1) such programs shall be administered at the national level; (2) such programs shall be available to federally recognized Indian tribes, bands, and groups and to other groups and individuals of Native American descent; and (3) such programs shall be administered in such a manner as to maximize the Federal commitment to support growth and development as determined by representatives of the communities and groups served by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Operation through Native American organizations where possible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In carrying out responsibilities under this section, the Secretary shall, wherever possible, utilize Indian tribes, bands, or groups on Federal or State reservations, Oklahoma Indians, and including for the purpose of this chapter, Alaska Native villages or groups as defined in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], having a governing body for the provision of employment and training services under this section. When the Secretary determines that such tribe, band, or group has demonstrated the capability to effectively administer a comprehensive employment and training program, the Secretary shall require such tribe, band, or group to submit a comprehensive plan meeting such requirements as the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall arrange for programs to meet the employment and training needs of Hawaiian natives through such organizations as the Secretary determines will best meet their needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out responsibilities under this section, the Secretary shall make arrangements with organizations (meeting requirements prescribed by the Secretary) serving nonreservation Native Americans for programs and projects designed to meet the needs of such Native Americans for employment and training and related services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternative operation through approved organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary determines not to utilize Indian tribes, bands, or groups for the provision of employment and training services under this section, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent feasible, enter into arrangements for the provision of such services with organizations which meet with the approval of the tribes, bands, or groups to be served.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Monitoring of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is directed to take appropriate action to establish administrative procedures and machinery (including personnel having particular competence in this field) for the selection, administration, monitoring, and evaluation of Native American employment and training programs authorized under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Availability of funds for other job training activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds available for this section shall be expended for programs and activities consistent with the purposes of this section including but not limited to such programs and activities carried out by recipients under other provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Continuation of Federal trust responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No provision of this section shall abrogate in any way the trust responsibilities of the Federal Government to Native American bands, tribes, or groups.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Consultation with Native Americans in prescription of regulations; performance goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, after consultation with representatives of Indians and other Native Americans, prescribe such rules, regulations, and performance standards pursuant to section 1516 of this title relating to Native American programs under this section as may be required to meet the special circumstances under which such programs operate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Recipients of funds under this section shall establish performance goals, which shall, to the extent required by the Secretary, comply with performance standards established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1516 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Technical assistance to Native American organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide technical assistance as necessary to tribes, bands, and groups eligible for assistance under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Organizational unit responsible for administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall designate a single organizational unit that shall have as its primary <!-- PDFPage:643 -->responsibility the administration of all Native American programs authorized under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such organizational unit shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be responsible for administering the provisions of the Native American programs authorized under this chapter, including monitoring such programs and making recommendations regarding the selection of the recipients of financial assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be responsible for the development of the policies and procedures related to the implementation of such programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) coordinate the development of policy and procedures for the employment and training programs within the Department relating to services for Native American workers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the hiring and promotion of the professional staff for the organizational unit designated under paragraph (1), special consideration shall be given to individuals who have field experience in the daily operation of service and training programs for Native Americans, and individuals who are Indians or Alaskan Natives. The Secretary shall take such additional actions as may be necessary to promote the recruitment and promotion of Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Hawaiian Natives to positions in such unit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Native American Employment and Training Council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is hereby established a Native American Employment and Training Council (referred to in this subsection as the &ldquo;Council&rdquo;), which shall consist of not fewer than 17 Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Hawaiian Natives appointed by the Secretary from among individuals nominated by Indian tribes or Indian, Alaskan Native, or Hawaiian Native organizations.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) chronic seasonal unemployment and underemployment in the agricultural industry, aggravated by continual advancements in technology and mechanization resulting in displacement, constitute a substantial portion of the Nation's rural employment problem and substantially affect the entire national economy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) because of the special nature of farmworker employment and training problems, such programs shall be centrally administered at the national level.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Monitoring of programs for migrant and seasonal employment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is directed to take appropriate action to establish administrative procedures and machinery (including personnel having particular competence in this field) for the selection, administration, monitoring, and evaluation of migrant and seasonal employment and training programs authorized under this chapter.</p>

In awarding any grant or contract for services under this section, the Secretary shall use procedures consistent with standard competitive Government procurement policies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The competition for grants under this section shall be conducted every 2 years, except that if a recipient of such a grant has performed satisfactorily under the terms of the existing grant agreement, the Secretary may waive the requirement for such competition upon receipt from the recipient of a satisfactory 2-year program plan for the succeeding 2-year grant period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Programs and activities supported under this section, including those carried out under other provisions of this chapter, shall enable farmworkers and their dependents to obtain or retain employment, to participate in other program activities leading to their eventual placement in unsubsidized agricultural or nonagricultural employment, and to participate in activities leading to stabilization in agricultural employment, and shall include related assistance and supportive services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Recipients of funds under this section shall establish performance goals, which shall, to the extent required by the Secretary, comply with performance standards established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1516 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contractor's obligations; training program contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A contractor subject to the affirmative action obligations of Executive Order 11246, as amended, issued September 24, 1965, may establish or participate in training programs pursuant to this section for individuals meeting the eligibility criteria established in section&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1781_1_target" name="1781_1">1</a></sup> 1603, 1643, 1671, and 1672 of this title, which are designed to assist such contractors in meeting the affirmative action obligations of such Executive order. To qualify under this section, such a training program shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a description of the jobs in the contractor's work force or in the service delivery <!-- PDFPage:676 -->area, for which the contractor has determined there is a need for training;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of the recruiting, training, or other functions that the contractor, or the organization that will be engaged to perform the training, will perform and the steps that will be taken to insure that eligible individuals will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be selected for participation in training,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be trained in necessary skills, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in accordance with the objectives of such Executive order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whenever an organization other than the contractor will perform the training, a description of the demonstrated effectiveness of the organization as a provider of employment and training services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of how the contractor will monitor the program to keep an accurate accounting of all trainees, including (A) whether the trainees successfully complete the training program, and (B) whether the trainees are or are not placed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an estimation of the cost of the program and an assurance that the contractor will assume all costs of the program or the pro rata share of costs to the contractor of the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review of community-need directed programs; programs includable in performance accomplishments; determination of affirmative action compliance; notice of compliance; abbreviated affirmative action program; successful performance and presumption of good faith effort; limitation; &ldquo;successful performance or operation&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) If the training proposal is designed to meet the needs of the community rather than, or in addition to, the employment needs of the contractor, and has not been approved by another Federal agency, the program shall be submitted to the private industry council established under section 1512 of this title for a determination that there is a need for such training in the community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Individuals trained under any program satisfying the requirements of this section may be included by the private industry council in its performance accomplishments and the wage gains of such individuals shall be included in determining the compliance of the job training program of the private industry council with applicable standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, Department of Labor, shall promulgate regulations setting forth how the Office will determine, during a compliance review, the degree to which a training program will satisfy the contractor's affirmative action obligations. The training and placement of trainees with employers other than the contractor may be considered in evaluating such contractor's overall good faith efforts, but in no event may placement of trainees with employers other than the contractor be permitted to affect that contractor's affirmative action obligations respecting its work force. The content of the training program will not be subject to review or regulation by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs. If during a compliance review the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs determines that a training program does not comply with its regulations, the Director shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the contractor of the disapproval,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) set forth the reasons for the disapproval, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide a list of recommendations which, if accepted, will qualify the training program under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A contractor who has a training program which contains the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section and which is in accordance with regulations promulgated under paragraph (2) of this subsection shall continue to meet the affirmative action obligations of Executive Order 11246, as amended, but the contractors required to maintain a written affirmative action program need only maintain an abbreviated affirmative action program, the content and length of which shall be determined by the Director of the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, to satisfy the written affirmative action program portion of their obligations under Executive Order 11246, as amended. Successful performance or operation of a training program meeting the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section shall create a presumption that the contractor has made a good faith effort to meet its affirmative action obligations to the degree specified by the Director under paragraph (2) of this subsection, but that presumption shall not be applicable to the satisfaction of other affirmative action obligations not directly related to the training and hiring requirements of this section, or other affirmative action obligations not affected by this section. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, &ldquo;successful performance or operation&rdquo; means training and placing in jobs a number of individuals which bears a reasonable relationship to the number of job openings in the contractors's&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1781_2_target" name="1781_2">2</a></sup> facilities or in the relevant labor market area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations: compulsory program involvement; exclusive compliance criteria; obligations of nonparticipating contractors; interference with private industry councils; restriction of Secretary's authority; short form affirmative action plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section may be interpreted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to compel contractor involvement in such programs,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to establish the exclusive criteria by which a contractor can be found to have fulfilled its affirmative action obligations,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide authority for imposing any additional obligations on contractors not participating in such training activities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to permit the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs to intervene or interfere with the authority and responsibilities of the private industry councils,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to restrict or limit the authority of the Secretary to investigate the employment practices of any Government contractor, to <!-- PDFPage:677 -->initiate such investigation by the Director, to determine whether any nondiscrimination contractual provisions have been violated, or to enforce Executive Order 11246, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to prohibit the Secretary or the Director, or other authorized officers of the United States, from requesting or compelling any contractor preparing and maintaining a short form affirmative action plan under subsection (b) of this section to provide information necessary to conduct a compliance review or to provide data necessary to determine whether any violation of Executive Order 11246 has occurred.</p>
