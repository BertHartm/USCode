<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this subpart, the amount of any allotment made under subparagraph (A) to a State for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of financial assistance received by centers for independent living in the State for fiscal year 1992 under part B of this subchapter, as in effect on the day before October 29, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Minimums</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless the director of a designated State unit awards grants under section 796f&ndash;2 of this title to eligible agencies in a State for a fiscal year, the Commissioner shall award grants under this section to such eligible agencies for such fiscal year from the amount of funds allotted to the State under subsection (c) or (d) of section 796f of this title for such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner shall award such grants, from the amount of funds so allotted, to such eligible agencies for the planning, conduct, administration, and evaluation of centers for independent living that comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f&ndash;4 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In any State in which the Commissioner has approved the State plan required by section 796c of this title, the Commissioner may make a grant under this section to any eligible agency that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is determined by the Commissioner to be able to plan, conduct, administer, and evaluate a center for independent living consistent with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f&ndash;4 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) submits an application to the Commissioner at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Commissioner may require.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the administration of the provisions of this section, the Commissioner shall award grants to any eligible agency that has been awarded a grant under this subpart by September 30, 1993, unless the Commissioner makes a finding that the agency involved fails to meet program and fiscal standards and assurances set forth in section 796f&ndash;4 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) New centers for independent living</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there is no center for independent living serving a region of the State or a region is underserved, and the increase in the allotment of the State is sufficient to support an additional center for independent living in the State, the Commissioner may award a grant under this section to the most qualified applicant proposing to serve such region, consistent with the provisions in the State plan setting forth the design of the State for establishing a statewide network of centers for independent living.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Selection</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any past performance of such applicant in providing services comparable to independent living services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the plan for satisfying or demonstrated success in satisfying the standards and the assurances set forth in section 796f&ndash;4 of this title;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) shall give priority to applications from applicants proposing to serve geographic areas within each State that are currently unserved or underserved by independent living programs, consistent with the provisions of the State plan submitted under section 796c of this title regarding establishment of a statewide network of centers for independent living.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Current centers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), a center for independent living that receives assistance under subpart 2 (or part A of this subchapter as in effect on the day before October 29, 1992) for a fiscal year for the general operation of the center shall be eligible for a grant for the subsequent fiscal year under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Order of priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner shall be guided by the following order of priorities in allocating funds among centers for independent living within a State, to the extent funds are available:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Commissioner shall support existing centers for independent living, as described in subsection (c) of this section, that comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f&ndash;4 of this title, at the level of funding for the previous year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commissioner shall provide for a cost-of-living increase for such existing centers for independent living.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Commissioner shall fund new centers for independent living, as described in subsection (d) of this section, that comply with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f&ndash;4 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nonresidential agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A center that provides or manages residential housing after October 1, 1994, shall not be considered to be an eligible agency under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner shall periodically review each center receiving funds under this section to determine whether such center is in compliance with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f&ndash;4 of this title. If the Commissioner determines that any center receiving funds under this section is not in compliance with the standards and assurances set forth in section 796f&ndash;4 of this title, the Commissioner shall immediately notify such center that it is out of compliance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner shall terminate all funds under this section to such center 90 days after the date of such notification unless the center submits a plan to achieve compliance within 90 days of such notification and such plan is approved by the Commissioner.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Initial year</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Beginning on October 1, 1993, the director of a designated State unit, as provided in paragraph (2), or the Commissioner, as provided in paragraph (3), shall award grants under this section for an initial fiscal year if the Commissioner determines that the amount of State funds that were earmarked by a State for a preceding fiscal year to support the general operation of centers for independent living meeting the requirements of this subpart equaled or exceeded the amount of funds allotted to the State under subsection (c) or (d) of section 796f of this title for such year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each year subsequent to the initial fiscal year described in subparagraph (A), the director of the designated State unit shall continue to have the authority to award such grants under this section if the Commissioner determines that the State continues to earmark the amount of State funds described in subparagraph (A)(i). If the State does not continue to earmark such an amount for a fiscal year, the State shall be ineligible to make grants under this section after a final year following such fiscal year, as defined in accordance with regulations established by the Commissioner, and for each subsequent fiscal year.</p>

If the Commissioner makes a determination described in subparagraph (A)(i) or (B), as appropriate, of paragraph (1), the Commissioner shall approve the application and designate the director of the designated State unit to award the grant and carry out this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Grants by Commissioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the designated State agency of a State described in paragraph (1) does not submit and obtain approval of an application under paragraph (2), the Commissioner shall award the grant described in paragraph (1) to eligible agencies in the State in accordance with section 796f&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
