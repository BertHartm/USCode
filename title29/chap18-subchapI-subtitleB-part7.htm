<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such exclusion extends for a period of not more than 12 months (or 18 months in the case of a late enrollee) after the enrollment date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the period of any such preexisting condition exclusion is reduced by the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage (if any, as defined in subsection (c)(1) of this section) applicable to the participant or beneficiary as of the enrollment date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may elect to apply subsection (a)(3) of this section based on coverage of benefits within each of several classes or categories of benefits specified in regulations rather than as provided under subparagraph (A). Such election shall be made on a uniform basis for all participants and beneficiaries.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (4), a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion in the case of a child who is adopted or placed for adoption before attaining 18 years of age and who, as of the last day of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the adoption or placement for adoption, is covered under creditable coverage. The previous sentence shall not apply to coverage before the date of such adoption or placement for adoption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusion not applicable to pregnancy</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement for certification of period of creditable coverage</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, shall provide the certification described in subparagraph (B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at the time an individual ceases to be covered under the plan or otherwise becomes covered under a COBRA continuation provision,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of an individual becoming covered under such a provision, at the time the individual ceases to be covered under such provision, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Issuer compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that medical care under a group health plan consists of group health insurance coverage, the plan is deemed to have satisfied the certification requirement under this paragraph if the health insurance issuer offering the coverage provides for such certification in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disclosure of information on previous benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an election described in subsection (c)(3)(B) of this section by a group health plan or health insurance issuer, if the plan or issuer enrolls an individual for coverage under the plan and the individual provides a certification of coverage of the individual under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) upon request of such plan or issuer, the entity which issued the certification provided by the individual shall promptly disclose to such requesting plan or issuer information on coverage of classes and categories of health benefits available under such entity's plan or coverage, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The employee's or dependent's coverage described in subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was under a COBRA continuation provision and the coverage under such provision was exhausted; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was not under such a provision and either the coverage was terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for the coverage (including as a result of legal separation, divorce, death, termination of employment, or reduction in the number of hours of employment) or employer contributions toward such coverage were terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Under the terms of the plan, the employee requests such enrollment not later than 30 days after the date of exhaustion of coverage described in subparagraph (C)(i) or termination of coverage or employer contribution described in subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the individual is a participant under the plan (or has met any waiting period applicable to becoming a participant under the plan and is eligible to be enrolled under the plan but for a failure to enroll during a previous enrollment period), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a person becomes such a dependent of the individual through marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for adoption,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the group health plan shall provide for a dependent special enrollment period described in subparagraph (B) during which the person (or, if not otherwise enrolled, the individual) may be enrolled under the plan as a dependent of the individual, and in the case of the birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of the individual may be enrolled as a dependent of the individual if such spouse is otherwise eligible for coverage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Dependent special enrollment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A dependent special enrollment period under this subparagraph shall be a period of not less than 30 days and shall begin on the later of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No waiting period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an individual seeks to enroll a dependent during the first 30 days of such a dependent special enrollment period, the coverage of the dependent shall become effective&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a dependent's birth, as of the date of such birth; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the case of a dependent's adoption or placement for adoption, the date of such adoption or placement for adoption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use of affiliation period by HMOs as alternative to preexisting condition exclusion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan that offers medical care through health insurance coverage offered by a health maintenance organization, the plan may provide for an affiliation period with respect to coverage through the organization only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no preexisting condition exclusion is imposed with respect to coverage through the organization,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period is applied uniformly without regard to any health status-related factors, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such period does not exceed 2 months (or 3 months in the case of a late enrollee).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Affiliation period</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Beginning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such period shall begin on the enrollment date.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Runs concurrently with waiting periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An affiliation period under a plan shall run concurrently with any waiting period under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Alternative methods</h4>
