<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1322. Single-employer plan benefits guaranteed</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nonforfeitable benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations contained in subsection (b) of this section, the corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a single-employer plan which terminates at a time when this subchapter applies to it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (7)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) no benefits provided by a plan which has been in effect for less than 60 months at the time the plan terminates shall be guaranteed under this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any increase in the amount of benefits under a plan resulting from a plan amendment which was made, or became effective, whichever is later, within 60 months before the date on which the plan terminates shall be disregarded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the time a successor plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) has been in effect includes the time a previously established plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) was in effect. For purposes of determining what benefits are guaranteed under this section in the case of a plan to which section 1321 of this title does not apply on September 3, 1974, the 60-month period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed beginning on the first date on which such section does apply to the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of monthly benefits described in subsection (a) of this section provided by a plan, which are guaranteed under this section with respect to a participant, shall not have an actuarial value which exceeds the actuarial value of a monthly benefit in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 65 equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) his average monthly gross income from his employer during the 5 consecutive calendar year period (or, if less, during the number of calendar years in such period in which he actively participates in the plan) during which his gross income from that employer was greater than during any other such period with that employer determined by dividing 1/12 of the sum of all such gross income by the number of such calendar years in which he had such gross income, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $750 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 430]) in effect at the time the plan terminates and the denominator of which is such contribution and benefit base in effect in calendar year 1974.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to non-basic benefits. The maximum guaranteed monthly benefit shall not be reduced solely on account of the age of a participant in the case of a benefit payable by reason of disability that occurred on or before the termination date, if the participant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that the Social Security Admin<!-- PDFPage:508 -->istration has determined that the participant satisfies the definition of disability under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.; 1381 et seq.], and the regulations thereunder. If a benefit payable by reason of disability is converted to an early or normal retirement benefit for reasons other than a change in the health of the participant, such early or normal retirement benefit shall be treated as a continuation of the benefit payable by reason of disability and this subparagraph shall continue to apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The actuarial value of a benefit, for purposes of this subsection, shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of paragraph (3)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; means &ldquo;earned income&rdquo; within the meaning of section 911(b) of title 26 (determined without regard to any community property laws),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a participant in a plan under which contributions are made by more than one employer, amounts received as gross income from any employer under that plan shall be aggregated with amounts received from any other employer under that plan during the same period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any non-basic benefit shall be disregarded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;substantial owner&rdquo; means an individual who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a partnership, is a partner who owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of either the capital interest or the profits interest in such partnership, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of a corporation, owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent in value of either the voting stock of that corporation or all the stock of that corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of clause (iii) the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) of title 26 shall apply (determined without regard to section 1563(e)(3)(C)). For purposes of this subchapter an individual is also treated as a substantial owner with respect to a plan if, at any time within the 60 months preceding the date on which the determination is made, he was a substantial owner under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a participant in a plan under which benefits have not been increased by reason of any plan amendments and who is covered by the plan as a substantial owner, the amount of benefits guaranteed under this section shall not exceed the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a fraction (not to exceed 1) the numerator of which is the number of years the substantial owner was an active participant in the plan, and the denominator of which is 30, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of the substantial owner's monthly benefits guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section (as limited under paragraph (3) of this subsection).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a participant in a plan, other than a plan described in subparagraph (B), who is covered by the plan as a substantial owner, the amount of the benefit guaranteed under this section shall, under regulations prescribed by the corporation, treat each benefit increase attributable to a plan amendment as if it were provided under a new plan. The benefits guaranteed under this section with respect to all such amendments shall not exceed the amount which would be determined under subparagraph (B) if subparagraph (B) applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which the Secretary of the Treasury issues notice that he has determined that any trust which is a part of a plan does not meet the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26, or that the plan does not meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous. This subparagraph does not apply if the Secretary subsequently issues a notice that such trust meets the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26 or that the plan meets the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26 and if the Secretary determines that the trust or plan has taken action necessary to meet such requirements during the period between the issuance of the notice referred to in the preceding sentence and the issuance of the notice referred to in this sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No benefits accrued under a plan after the date on which an amendment of the plan is adopted which causes the Secretary of the Treasury to determine that any trust under the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26 or that the plan has ceased to meet the requirements of section 404(a)(2) of title 26, are guaranteed under this section unless such determination is erroneous. This subparagraph shall not apply if the amendment is revoked as of the date it was first effective or amended to comply with such requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Benefits described in paragraph (1) are guaranteed only to the extent of the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 20 percent of the amount which, but for the fact that the plan or amendment has not been in effect for 60 months or more, would be guaranteed under this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $20 per month,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">multiplied by the number of years (but not more than 5) the plan or amendment, as the case may be, has been in effect. In determining how many years a plan or amendment has been in effect for purposes of this paragraph, the first 12 months beginning with the date on which the plan or amendment is made or first becomes effective (whichever is later) constitutes one year, and each consecutive period of 12 months thereafter constitutes an additional year. This paragraph does not apply to benefits payable under a plan unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment by corporation to participants and beneficiaries of recovery percentage of outstanding amount of benefit liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to benefits paid under the preceding provisions of this section with respect to a terminated plan, the corporation shall pay the portion of the amount determined under paragraph (2) which is allocated with respect to each <!-- PDFPage:509 -->participant under section 1344(a) of this title. Such payment shall be made to such participant or to such participant's beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount determined under this paragraph is an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the outstanding amount of benefit liabilities under the plan (including interest calculated from the termination date), by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the applicable recovery ratio.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), for purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;recovery ratio&rdquo; means the average ratio, with respect to prior plan terminations described in subparagraph (B), of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the value of the recovery of the corporation under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title in connection with such prior terminations, to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under such plans as of the termination date in connection with such prior terminations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan termination described in this subparagraph is a termination with respect to which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the corporation has determined the value of recoveries under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notices of intent to terminate were provided after December 17, 1987, and during the 5-Federal fiscal year period ending with the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year in which occurs the date of the notice of intent to terminate with respect to the plan termination for which the recovery ratio is being determined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a terminated plan with respect to which the outstanding amount of benefit liabilities exceeds $20,000,000, for purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;recovery ratio&rdquo; means, with respect to the termination of such plan, the ratio of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the value of the recoveries of the corporation under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title in connection with such plan, to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under such plan as of the termination date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Determinations under this subsection shall be made by the corporation. Such determinations shall be binding unless shown by clear and convincing evidence to be unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization to guarantee other classes of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation is authorized to guarantee the payment of such other classes of benefits and to establish the terms and conditions under which such other classes of benefits are guaranteed as it determines to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonforfeitability of preretirement survivor annuity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, a qualified preretirement survivor annuity (as defined in section 1055(e)(1) of this title) with respect to a participant under a terminated single-employer plan shall not be treated as forfeitable solely because the participant has not died as of the termination date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effective date of plan amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the effective date of a plan amendment described in section 1054(i)(1) of this title shall be the effective date of the plan of reorganization of the employer described in section 1054(i)(1) of this title or, if later, the effective date stated in such amendment.</p>
