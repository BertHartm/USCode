<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Criterion for eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual is eligible for assistance under this subchapter if the individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is an individual with a disability under section 705(20)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, or regain employment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Presumption of benefit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Demonstration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, an individual shall be presumed to be an individual that can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services under section 705(20)(A) of this title, unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making the demonstration required under subparagraph (A), the designated State unit shall explore the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations, through the use of trial work experiences, as described in section 705(2)(D) of this title, with appropriate supports provided through the designated State unit, except under limited circumstances when an individual cannot take advantage of such experiences. Such experiences shall be of sufficient variety and over a sufficient period of time to determine the eligibility of the individual or to determine the existence of clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Presumption of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, an individual who has a disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. and 1381 et seq.) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) considered to be an individual with a significant disability under section 705(21)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter (provided that the individual intends to achieve an employment outcome consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual) unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of existing information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the maximum extent appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part, for purposes of determining the eligibility of an individual for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter and developing the individualized plan for employment described in subsection (b) of this section for the individual, the designated State unit shall use information that is existing and current (as of the date of the determination of eligibility or of the development of the individualized plan for employment), including information available from other programs and providers, particularly information used by education officials and the Social Security Administration, information provided by the individual and the family of the individual, and information obtained under the assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The determination of eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the review of existing data described in section 705(2)(A)(i) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent that such data is unavailable or insufficient for determining eligibility, the provision of assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Determination of ineligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual who applies for services under this subchapter is determined, based on the review of existing data and, to the extent necessary, the assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title, not to be eligible for the services, or if an eligible individual receiving services under an individualized plan for employment is determined to be no longer eligible for the services&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) within 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) thereafter, if such a review is requested by the individual or, if appropriate, by the individual's representative.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Timeframe for making an eligibility determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The designated State unit shall determine whether an individual is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, after the individual has submitted an application for the services unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) exceptional and unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of the designated State unit preclude making an eligibility determination within 60 days and the designated State unit and the individual agree to a specific extension of time; or</p>
