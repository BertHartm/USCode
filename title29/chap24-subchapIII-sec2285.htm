<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), a grant under section 2281 of this title shall be for an amount that is not more than $500,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Increases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such a grant may be increased by any additional funds made available under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Excess funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If funds appropriated under section 2288 of this title for a fiscal year exceed the amount necessary to fund the activities described in acceptable applications submitted under section 2282 of this title for such year, the Secretary shall make such excess amount available, on a competitive basis, to States receiving grants under section 2281 of this title for such year. A State that desires to receive additional funds under this subsection shall amend and resubmit to the Secretary the application submitted under section 2282 of this title. Such amended application shall contain an assurance that the State will provide an additional amount for the purpose of supporting the alternative financing mechanisms covered by the grant that is not less than the amount of any additional funds paid to the State by the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insufficient funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If funds appropriated under section 2288 of this title for a fiscal year are not sufficient to fund each of the activities described in the acceptable applications for such year, a State whose application was approved as acceptable for such year but that did not receive a grant under section 2281 of this title, may update such application for the succeeding fiscal year. Priority shall be given in such succeeding fiscal year to such updated applications, if acceptable.</p>
