<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13163. Increasing the Opportunity for Individuals With Disabilities To Be Employed in the Federal Government</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13163, July 26, 2000, 65 F.R. 46563, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to promote an increase in the opportunities for individuals with disabilities to be employed at all levels and occupations of the Federal Government, and to support the goals articulated in section 501 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 791), it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Increasing the Federal Employment Opportunities for Individuals with Disabilities</em>. (a) Recent evidence demonstrates that, throughout the United States, qualified persons with disabilities have been refused employment despite their availability and qualifications, and many qualified persons with disabilities are never made aware of available employment opportunities. Evidence also suggests that increased efforts at outreach, and increased understanding of the reasonable accommodations available for persons with disabilities, will permit persons with disabilities to compete for employment on a more level playing field.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Based on current hiring patterns and anticipated increases from expanded outreach efforts and appropriate accommodations, the Federal Government, over the next 5 years, will be able to hire 100,000 qualified individuals with disabilities. In furtherance of such efforts, Federal agencies shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) Use available hiring authorities, consistent with statutes, regulations, and prior Executive orders and Presidential Memoranda;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Expand their outreach efforts, using both traditional and nontraditional methods; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) Increase their efforts to accommodate individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) As a model employer, the Federal Government will take the lead in educating the public about employment opportunities available for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) This order does not require agencies to create new positions or to change existing qualification standards for any position.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Implementation</em>. Each Federal agency shall prepare a plan to increase the opportunities for individuals with disabilities to be employed in the agency. Each agency shall submit that plan to the Office of Personnel Management within 60 days from the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Authority to Develop Guidance</em>. The Office of Personnel Management shall develop guidance on the provisions of this order to increase the opportunities <!-- PDFPage:260 -->for individuals with disabilities employed in the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, its employees, or any person.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13164. Requiring Federal Agencies To Establish Procedures To Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13164, July 26, 2000, 65 F.R. 46565, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (29 U.S.C. 701 <em>et seq</em>.), as amended, and in order to promote a model Federal workplace that provides reasonable accommodation for (1) individuals with disabilities in the application process for Federal employment; (2) Federal employees with disabilities to perform the essential functions of a position; and (3) Federal employees with disabilities to enjoy benefits and privileges of employment equal to those enjoyed by employees without disabilities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Establishment of Effective Written Procedures to Facilitate the Provision of Reasonable Accommodation</em>. (a) Each Federal agency shall establish effective written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation by employees and applicants with disabilities. The written procedures may allow different components of an agency to tailor their procedures as necessary to ensure the expeditious processing of requests.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As set forth in <em>Re-charting the Course: The First Report of the Presidential Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities</em> (1998), effective written procedures for processing requests for reasonable accommodation should include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) Explain that an employee or job applicant may initiate a request for reasonable accommodation orally or in writing. If the agency requires an applicant or employee to complete a reasonable accommodation request form for recordkeeping purposes, the form must be provided as an attachment to the agency's written procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Explain how the agency will process a request for reasonable accommodation, and from whom the individual will receive a final decision;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) Designate a time period during which reasonable accommodation requests will be granted or denied, absent extenuating circumstances. Time limits for decision making should be as short as reasonably possible;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) Explain the responsibility of the employee or applicant to provide appropriate medical information related to the functional impairment at issue and the requested accommodation where the disability and/or need for accommodation is not obvious;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) Explain the agency's right to request relevant supplemental medical information if the information submitted does not clearly explain the nature of the disability, or the need for the reasonable accommodation, or does not otherwise clarify how the requested accommodation will assist the employee to perform the essential functions of the job or to enjoy the benefits and privileges of the workplace;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(6) Explain the agency's right to have medical information reviewed by a medical expert of the agency's choosing at the agency's expense;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(7) Provide that reassignment will be considered as a reasonable accommodation if the agency determines that no other reasonable accommodation will permit the employee with a disability to perform the essential functions of his or her current position;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(8) Provide that reasonable accommodation denials be in writing and specify the reasons for denial;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(9) Ensure that agencies&rsquo; systems of recordkeeping track the processing of requests for reasonable accommodation and maintain the confidentiality of medical information received in accordance with applicable law and regulations; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(10) Encourage the use of informal dispute resolution processes to allow individuals with disabilities to obtain prompt reconsideration of denials of reasonable accommodation. Agencies must also inform individuals with disabilities that they have the right to file complaints in the Equal Employment Opportunity process and other statutory processes, as appropriate, if their requests for reasonable accommodation are denied.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Submission of Agency Reasonable Accommodation Procedures to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)</em>. Within 1 year from the date of this order, each agency shall submit its procedures to the EEOC. Each agency shall also submit to the EEOC any modifications to its reasonable accommodation procedures at the time that those modifications are adopted.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Collective Bargaining Obligations</em>. In adopting their reasonable accommodation procedures, agencies must honor their obligations to notify their collective bargaining representatives and bargain over such procedures to the extent required by law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Implementation</em>. The EEOC shall issue guidance for the implementation of this order within 90 days from the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Construction and Judicial Review</em>. (a) Nothing in this order limits the rights that individuals with disabilities may have under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and does not create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, its employees, or any person.</p>
