<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) of this subsection, the Secretary shall allot the remainder of the sums appropriated and certified pursuant to section 49d of this title for each fiscal year among the States as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) two-thirds of such sums shall be allotted on the basis of the relative number of individuals in the civilian labor force in each State as compared to the total number of such individuals in all States; and</p>

For each succeeding fiscal year, the allotment percentage for each such State shall be the percentage that the State received under this chapter for the preceding fiscal year of the total amounts available for allotments for all States for such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For each fiscal year, no State shall receive a total allotment under paragraphs (1) and (2) which is less than 0.28 percent of the total amount available for allotments for all States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall reserve such amount, not to exceed 3 percent of the sums available for allotments under this section for each fiscal year, as shall be necessary to assure that each State will have a total allotment under this section sufficient to provide staff and other resources necessary to carry out employment service activities and related administrative and support functions on a statewide basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall, not later than March 15 of fiscal year 1983 and each succeeding fiscal year, provide preliminary planning estimates and shall, not later than May 15 of each such fiscal year, provide final planning estimates, showing each State's projected allocation for the following year.</p>
