This clause shall not apply to any plan to which any mandatory contribution is made after September 2, 1974.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Satisfaction of requirements by pension plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a defined benefit plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a defined contribution plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enumeration of plan requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which each participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 3 percent of the normal retirement benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age if he commenced participation at the earliest possible entry age under the plan and served continuously until the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan, multiplied by</p>
<!-- PDFPage:358 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the number of years (not in excess of 331/3) of his participation in the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on compensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 1331/3 percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to September 2, 1974, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;year of service&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 1052(a)(3)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 1081(b) of this title (relating to certain insurance contract plans),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but only if an employee's accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 1081(b) of this title were satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant's accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] which benefits under the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) do not exceed social security benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) terminate when such social security benefits commence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee's benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:359 --><p class="statutory-body">(iii) In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with section 1056(a)(3) of this title, and the payment of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee is not suspended during such plan year pursuant to section 1053(a)(3)(B) of this title, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of any adjustment in the benefit payable under the plan during such plan year attributable to the delay in the distribution of benefits after the attainment of normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any employee who is a highly compensated employee (within the meaning of section 414(q) of title 26) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of precluding discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees within the meaning of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to clause (v) of section 411(b)(1)(H) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this subparagraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(1)(H).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee's account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee's account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 411(b)(2) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 1052(b) of this title, determined without regard to section 1052(b)(5) of this title) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) if a participant's accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the terms of the plan, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual who is or could be a participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Similarly situated</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, a participant is similarly <!-- PDFPage:360 -->situated to any other individual if such participant is identical to such other individual in every respect (including period of service, compensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other respect) except for age.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Applicable defined benefit plans.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Interest credits.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit (or an equivalent amount) for any plan year shall be at a rate which is not greater than a market rate of return. A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subclause merely because the plan provides for a reasonable minimum guaranteed rate of return or for a rate of return that is equal to the greater of a fixed or variable rate of return.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of capital</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the plan provides that an interest credit (or equivalent amount) of less than zero shall in no event result in the account balance or similar amount being less than the aggregate amount of contributions credited to the account.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for plan conversions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If, after June 29, 2005, an applicable plan amendment is adopted, the plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the requirements of clause (iii) are met with respect to each individual who was a participant in the plan immediately before the adoption of the amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Rate of benefit accrual</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to clause (iv), the requirements of this clause are met with respect to any participant if the accrued benefit of the participant under the terms of the plan as in effect after the amendment is not less than the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) <cap-smallcap>Special rule for coordinated benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the benefits of 2 or more defined benefit plans established or maintained by an employer are coordinated in such a manner as to have the effect of the adoption of an amendment described in subclause (I), the sponsor of the defined benefit plan or plans providing for such coordination shall be treated as having adopted such a plan amendment as of the date such coordination begins.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) <cap-smallcap>Multiple amendments</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations to prevent the avoidance of the purposes of this subparagraph through the use of 2 or more plan amendments rather than a single amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) <cap-smallcap>Applicable defined benefit plan</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;applicable defined benefit plan&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 1053(f)(3) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Certain offsets permitted</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) solely because the plan provides offsets against benefits under the plan to the extent such offsets are otherwise allowable in applying the requirements of section 401(a) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Permitted disparities in plan contributions or benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) solely because the plan provides a disparity in contributions or benefits with respect to which the requirements of section 401(<em>l</em>) of title 26 are met.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) <cap-smallcap>Benefit accrued to date</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this paragraph, any reference to the accrued benefit shall be a reference to such benefit accrued to date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Employee's accrued benefits derived from employer and employee contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section and section 1053 of this title an employee's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions as of any applicable date is the excess (if any) of the accrued benefit for such employee as of such applicable date over the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by such employee as of such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a plan other than a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) <cap-smallcap>Defined benefit plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;accumulated contributions&rdquo; means the total of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) all mandatory contributions made by the employee,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) interest on the sum of the amounts determined under clauses (i) and (ii) compounded annually&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of a plan year for the period beginning with the 1st plan year to which subsection (a)(2) of this section applies by reason of the applicable effective date) and ending with the date on which the determination is being made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) at the interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date) for the period beginning with the determination date and ending on the date on which the employee attains normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;mandatory contributions&rdquo; means amounts contributed to the plan by the employee which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plans, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to adjust by regulation the conversion factor described in subparagraph (B) from time to time as he may deem necessary. No such adjustment shall be effective for a plan year beginning before the expiration of 1 year after such adjustment is determined and published.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, in the case of any defined benefit plan, if an employee's accrued benefit is to be determined as an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee's accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:362 --><p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee's accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Employee service which may be disregarded in determining employee's accrued benefits under plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1053(b)(1) of this title, for purposes of determining the employee's accrued benefit under the plan, the plan may disregard service performed by the employee with respect to which he has received&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a distribution of the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than the dollar limit under section 1053(e)(1) of this title) permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a distribution of the present value of his nonforfeitable benefit attributable to such service which he elected to receive.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Paragraph (1) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee's participation in the plan. Paragraph (2) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee's participation in the plan or under such other circumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the employee's accrued benefit, the plan shall not disregard service as provided in subsection (d) of this section unless the plan provides an opportunity for the participant to repay the full amount of a distribution described in subsection (d) of this section with, in the case of a defined benefit plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section and provides that upon such repayment the employee's accrued benefit shall be recomputed by taking into account service so disregarded. This subsection shall apply only in the case of a participant who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) received such a distribution in any plan year to which this section applies which distribution was less than the present value of his accrued benefit,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such participant does not elect the payment of benefits in the form of a life annuity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) with respect to such participant, such plan is not a direct or indirect transferee (in a transfer after December 31, 1984) of a plan which is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) or to which this clause applied with respect to the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Clause (iii) of subparagraph (C) shall apply only with respect to the transferred assets (and income therefrom) if the plan separately accounts for such assets and any income therefrom.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1055_2_target" name="1055_2">2</a></sup> This section shall not apply to a plan which the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate has determined is a plan described in section 404(c) of title 26 (or a continuation thereof) in which participation is substantially limited to individuals who, before January 1, 1976, ceased employment covered by the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1055_2_target" name="1055_2">2</a></sup> A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(C) or (2) merely because the plan provides that benefits will not be payable to the surviving spouse of the participant unless the participant and such spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of the participant's annuity starting date or the date of the participant's death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Plans meeting requirements of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A plan meets the requirements of this section only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or a form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within a reasonable period of time before the annuity starting date (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe) a written explanation of&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within the applicable period with respect to such participant (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe), a written explanation with respect to the qualified preretirement survivor annuity comparable to that required under subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) A reasonable period after the individual becomes a participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) A reasonable period ending after paragraph (5) ceases to apply to the participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) A reasonable period ending after this section applies to the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who separates from service before attaining age 35, the applicable period shall be a reasonable period after separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each plan shall provide that, if this section applies to a participant when part or all of the participant's accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant's accrued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requirements comparable to the requirements of paragraph (2) are met with respect to such consent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply with respect to the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit, as the case may be, if such benefit may not be waived (or another beneficiary selected) and if the plan fully subsidizes the costs of such benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) relying on a consent or revocation referred to in paragraph (1)(A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) making a determination under paragraph (2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such consent, revocation, or determination shall be treated as valid for purposes of discharging the plan from liability to the extent of payments made pursuant to such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who is separated from service, the applicable election period under subparagraph (B) with respect to benefits accrued before the date of such separation from service shall not begin later than such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) A plan may provide the written explanation described in paragraph (3)(A) after the annuity starting date. In any case to which this subparagraph applies, the applicable election period under paragraph (7) shall not end before the 30th day after the date on which such explanation is provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations limit the application of clause (i), except that such regulations may not limit the period of time by which the annuity starting date precedes the provision of the written explanation other than by providing that the annuity starting date may not be earlier than termination of employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A plan may permit a participant to elect (with any applicable spousal consent) to waive any requirement that the written explanation be provided at least 30 days before the annuity starting date (or to waive the 30-day requirement under subparagraph (A)) if the distribution commences more than 7 days after such explanation is provided.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement date for payment of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall provide that unless the participant otherwise elects, the payment of benefits under the plan to the participant shall begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) occurs the date on which the participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) occurs the 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant commenced participation in the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the participant terminates his service with the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, such plan shall provide that a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Decrease in plan benefits by reason of increases in benefit levels under Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act of 1937</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a participant or beneficiary is receiving benefits under a pension plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a participant is separated from the service and has non-forfeitable rights to benefits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">a plan may not decrease benefits of such a participant by reason of any increase in the benefit levels payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] or any increase in the wage base under such title II, if such increase takes place after September 2, 1974, or (if later) the earlier of the date of first entitlement of such benefits or the date of such separation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forfeiture of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No pension plan may provide that any part of a participant's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from contributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply (1) to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit, or (2) to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 1053(a)(3)(D)(iii) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment or alienation of plan benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall not be taken into account any voluntary and revocable assignment of not to exceed 10 percent of any benefit payment, or of any irrevocable assignment or alienation of benefits executed before September 2, 1974. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any assignment or alienation made for the purposes of defraying plan administration costs. For purposes of this paragraph a loan made to a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated as an assignment or alienation if such loan is secured by the participant's accrued non-forfeitable benefit and is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4975 of title 26 (relating to tax on prohibited transactions) by reason of section 4975(d)(1) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. Each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;qualified domestic relations order&rdquo; means a domestic relations order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the term &ldquo;domestic relations order&rdquo; means any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:376 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) each plan to which such order applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subclause (II), the interest rate assumption used in determining the present value shall be the interest rate specified in the plan or, if no rate is specified, 5 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;earliest retirement age&rdquo; means the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the date on which the participant is entitled to a distribution under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the later of the date of the participant attains age 50 or the earliest date on which the participant could begin receiving benefits under the plan if the participant separated from service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F) To the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of section 1055 of this title (and any spouse of the participant shall not be treated as a spouse of the participant for such purposes), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if married for at least 1 year, the surviving former spouse shall be treated as meeting the requirements of section 1055(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan's procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Each plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) shall be in writing,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) shall provide for the notification of each person specified in a domestic relations order as entitled to payment of benefits under the plan (at the address included in the domestic relations order) of such procedures promptly upon receipt by the plan of the domestic relations order, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) shall permit an alternate payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the alternate payee with respect to a domestic relations order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;segregated amounts&rdquo;) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month period described in this clause is the 18-month period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under the domestic relations order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) taking action under subparagraph (H),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan's obligation to the participant and each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any payment made pursuant to such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(J) A person who is an alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order shall be considered for purposes of any provision of this chapter a beneficiary under the plan. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall permit a requirement under section 1301 of this title of the payment of more than 1 premium with respect to a participant for any period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(K) The term &ldquo;alternate payee&rdquo; means any spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant who is recognized by a domestic relations order as having a right to receive all, or a portion of, the benefits payable under a plan with respect to such participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(L) This paragraph shall not apply to any plan to which paragraph (1) does not apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(M) Payment of benefits by a pension plan in accordance with the applicable requirements of a qualified domestic relations order shall not be treated as garnishment for purposes of section 1673(a) of title 15.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any offset of a participant's benefits provided under an employee pension benefit plan against an amount that the participant is ordered or required to pay to the plan if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the order or requirement to pay arises&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) under a judgment of conviction for a crime involving such plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) under a civil judgment (including a consent order or decree) entered by a court in an action brought in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of this subtitle, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) pursuant to a settlement agreement between the Secretary and the participant, or a settlement agreement between the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and the participant, in connection with a violation (or alleged violation) of part 4 of this subtitle by a fiduciary or any other person,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the judgment, order, decree, or settlement agreement expressly provides for the offset of all or part of the amount ordered or required to be paid to the plan against the participant's benefits provided under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in a case in which the survivor annuity requirements of section 1055 of this title apply with respect to distributions from the plan to the participant, if the participant has a spouse at the time at which the offset is to be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) such spouse has consented in writing to such offset and such consent is witnessed by a notary public or representative of the plan (or it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that such consent may not be obtained by reason of circumstances described in section 1055(c)(2)(B) of this title), or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such spouse is ordered or required in such judgment, order, decree, or settlement to pay an amount to the plan in connection with a violation of part 4 of this subtitle, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in such judgment, order, decree, or settlement, such spouse retains the right to receive the survivor annuity under a qualified joint and survivor annuity provided pursuant to section 1055(a)(1) of this title and under a qualified preretirement survivor annuity provided pursuant to section 1055(a)(2) of this title, determined in accordance with paragraph (5).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of section 1055 of this title solely by reason of an offset under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the participant terminated employment on the date of the offset,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) there was no offset,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the plan permitted commencement of benefits only on or after normal retirement age,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the plan provided only the minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) the amount of the qualified preretirement survivor annuity under the plan is equal to the amount of the survivor annuity payable under the minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;minimum-required qualified joint and survivor annuity&rdquo; means the qualified joint and survivor annuity which is the actuarial equivalent of the participant's accrued benefit (within the meaning of section 1002(23) of this title) and under which the survivor annuity is 50 percent of the amount of the annuity which is payable during the joint lives of the participant and the spouse.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 1052 of this title shall be applied as if all employees of each of the employers were employed by a single employer.</p>
