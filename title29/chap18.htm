<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Benefit plans as affecting interstate commerce and the Federal taxing power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans in recent years has been rapid and substantial; that the operational scope and economic impact of such plans is increasingly interstate; that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans; that they are affected with a national public interest; that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of industrial relations; that they have become an important factor in commerce because of the interstate character of their activities, and of the activities of their participants, and the employers, employee organizations, and other entities by which they are established or maintained; that a large volume of the activities of such plans are carried on by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; that owing to the lack of employee information and adequate safeguards concerning their operation, it is desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, and to provide for the general welfare and the free flow of commerce, that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of such plans; that they substantially affect the revenues of the United States because they are afforded preferential Federal tax treatment; that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards, the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered; that owing to the termination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated, employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits; and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, for the protection of the revenue of the United States, and to provide for the free flow of commerce, that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby further declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries by improving the equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued benefits of employees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum standards of funding, and by requiring plan termination insurance.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">Today I am submitting to the Congress my fourth Reorganization Plan for 1978. This proposal is designed to simplify and improve the unnecessarily complex administrative requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) [see Short Title note set out under this section]. The new plan will eliminate overlap and duplication in the administration of ERISA and help us achieve our goal of well regulated private pension plans.</p>
<p class="note-body">ERISA was an essential step in the protection of worker pension rights. Its administrative provisions, however, have resulted in bureaucratic confusion and have been justifiably criticized by employers and unions alike. The biggest problem has been overlapping jurisdictional authority. Under current ERISA provisions, the Departments of Treasury and Labor both have authority to issue regulations and decisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">This dual jurisdiction has delayed a good many important rulings and, more importantly, produced bureaucratic runarounds and burdensome reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new plan will significantly reduce these problems. In addition, both Departments are trying to cut red tape and paperwork, to eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements, and to streamline forms wherever possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both Departments have already made considerable progress, and both will continue the effort to simplify their rules and their forms.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Reorganization Plan is the most significant result of their joint effort to modify and simplify ERISA. It will eliminate most of the jurisdictional overlap between Treasury and Labor by making the following changes:</p>
<p class="note-body">1) Treasury will have statutory authority for minimum standards. The new plan puts all responsibility for funding, participation, and vesting of benefit rights in the Department of Treasury. These standards are necessary to ensure that employee benefit plans are adequately funded and that all beneficiary rights are protected. Treasury is the most appropriate Department to administer these provisions; however, Labor will continue to have veto power over Treasury decisions that significantly affect collectively bargained plans.</p>
<p class="note-body">2) Labor will have statutory authority for fiduciary obligations. ERISA prohibits transactions in which self-interest or conflict of interest could occur, but allows certain exemptions from these prohibitions. Labor will be responsible for overseeing fiduciary conduct under these provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">3) Both Departments will retain enforcement powers. The Reorganization Plan will continue Treasury's authority to audit plans and levy tax penalties for any deviation from standards. The plan will also continue Labor's authority to bring civil action against plans and fiduciaries. These provisions are retained in order to keep the special expertise of each Department available. New coordination between the Departments will eliminate duplicative investigations of alleged violations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization will make an immediate improvement in ERISA's administration. It will eliminate almost all of the dual and overlapping authority in the two departments and dramatically cut the time required to process applications for exemptions from prohibited transactions.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan is an interim arrangement. After the Departments have had a chance to administer ERISA under this new plan, the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments will jointly evaluate that experience. Based on that evaluation, early in 1980, the Administration will make appropriate legislative proposals to establish a long-term administrative structure for ERISA.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each provision in this reorganization will accomplish one or more of the purposes in Title 5 of U.S.C. 901(a). There will be no change in expenditure or personnel levels, although a small number of people will be transferred from the Department of Treasury to the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="note-body">We all recognize that the administration of ERISA has been unduly burdensome. I am confident that this reorganization will significantly relieve much of that burden.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan is the culmination of our effort to streamline ERISA. It provides an administrative arrangement that will work.</p>
<p class="note-body">ERISA has been a symbol of unnecessarily complex government regulation. I hope this new step will become equally symbolic of my Administration's commitment to making government more effective and less intrusive in the lives of our people.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) multiemployer pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) multiemployer pension plans have accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in private pension plan coverage over the past three decades;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the continued well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by multiemployer pension plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in subparagraph (A) are exacerbated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.</p>

Such examination shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and shall involve such tests of the books and records of the plan as are considered necessary by the independent qualified public accountant.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Filing of annual report with Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrator of any employee benefit plan subject to this part shall file with the Secretary the annual report for a plan year within 210 days after the close of such year (or within such time as may be required by regulations promulgated by the Secretary in order to reduce duplicative filing). The Secretary shall make copies of such annual reports available for inspection in the public document room of the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to annual reports required to be filed with the Secretary under this part, he may by regulation prescribe simplified annual reports for any pension plan which covers less than 100 participants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Nothing contained in this paragraph shall preclude the Secretary from requiring any information or data from any such plan to which this part applies where he finds such data or information is necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter nor shall the Secretary be precluded from revoking provisions for simplified reports for any such plan if he finds it necessary to do so in order to carry out the objectives of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may by regulation exempt any welfare benefit plan from all or part of the reporting and disclosure requirements of this subchapter, or may provide for simplified reporting and disclosure if he finds that such requirements are inappropriate as applied to welfare benefit plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may reject any filing under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if he determines that such filing is incomplete for purposes of this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if he determines that there is any material qualification by an accountant or actuary contained in an opinion submitted pursuant to section 1023(a)(3)(A) or section 1023(a)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Secretary rejects a filing of a report under paragraph (4) and if a revised filing satisfactory to the Secretary is not submitted within 45 days after the Secretary makes his determination under paragraph (4) to reject the filing, and if the Secretary deems it in the best interest of the participants, he may take any one or more of the following actions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) retain an independent qualified public accountant (as defined in section 1023(a)(3)(D) of this title) on behalf of the participants to perform an audit,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) retain an enrolled actuary (as defined in section 1023(a)(4)(C) of this title) on behalf of the plan participants, to prepare an actuarial statement,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) bring a civil action for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to enforce the provisions of this part, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) take any other action authorized by this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The administrator shall permit such accountant or actuary to inspect whatever books and records of the plan are necessary for such audit. The plan shall be liable to the Secretary for the expenses for such audit or report, and the Secretary may bring an action against the plan in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover such expenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The administrator of any employee benefit plan subject to this part shall furnish to the Secretary, upon request, any documents relating to the employee benefit plan, including but not limited to, the latest summary plan description (including any summaries of plan changes not contained in the summary plan description), and the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instrument under which the plan is established or operated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Publication of summary plan description and annual report to participants and beneficiaries of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Publication of the summary plan descriptions and annual reports shall be made to participants and beneficiaries of the particular plan as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrator shall furnish to each participant, and each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan, a copy of the summary plan description, and all modifications and changes referred to in section 1022(a) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within 90 days after he becomes a participant, or (in the case of a beneficiary) within 90 days after he first receives benefits, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:342 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if later, within 120 days after the plan becomes subject to this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The administrator shall furnish to each participant, and each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan, every fifth year after the plan becomes subject to this part an updated summary plan description described in section 1022 of this title which integrates all plan amendments made within such five-year period, except that in a case where no amendments have been made to a plan during such five-year period this sentence shall not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator shall furnish to each participant, and to each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan, the summary plan description described in section 1022 of this title every tenth year after the plan becomes subject to this part. If there is a modification or change described in section 1022(a) of this title (other than a material reduction in covered services or benefits provided in the case of a group health plan (as defined in section 1191b(a)(1) of this title)), a summary description of such modification or change shall be furnished not later than 210 days after the end of the plan year in which the change is adopted to each participant, and to each beneficiary who is receiving benefits under the plan. If there is a modification or change described in section 1022(a) of this title that is a material reduction in covered services or benefits provided under a group health plan (as defined in section 1191b(a)(1) of this title), a summary description of such modification or change shall be furnished to participants and beneficiaries not later than 60 days after the date of the adoption of the modification or change. In the alternative, the plan sponsors may provide such description at regular intervals of not more than 90 days. The Secretary shall issue regulations within 180 days after August 21, 1996, providing alternative mechanisms to delivery by mail through which group health plans (as so defined) may notify participants and beneficiaries of material reductions in covered services or benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The administrator shall make copies of the latest updated summary plan description and the latest annual report and the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan was established or is operated available for examination by any plan participant or beneficiary in the principal office of the administrator and in such other places as may be necessary to make available all pertinent information to all participants (including such places as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 210 days after the close of the fiscal year of the plan, the administrator (other than an administrator of a defined benefit plan to which the requirements of section 1021(f) of this title applies)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1024_1_target" name="1024_1">1</a></sup> shall furnish to each participant, and to each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan, a copy of the statements and schedules, for such fiscal year, described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1023(b)(3) of this title and such other material (including the percentage determined under section 1023(d)(11) of this title) as is necessary to fairly summarize the latest annual report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The administrator shall, upon written request of any participant or beneficiary, furnish a copy of the latest updated summary,<sup><a href="#1024_2_target" name="1024_2">2</a></sup> plan description, and the latest annual report, any terminal report, the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated. The administrator may make a reasonable charge to cover the cost of furnishing such complete copies. The Secretary may by regulation prescribe the maximum amount which will constitute a reasonable charge under the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Identification and basic plan information and actuarial information included in the annual report for any plan year shall be filed with the Secretary in an electronic format which accommodates display on the Internet, in accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the Secretary. The Secretary shall provide for display of such information included in the annual report, within 90 days after the date of the filing of the annual report, on an Internet website maintained by the Secretary and other appropriate media. Such information shall also be displayed on any Intranet website maintained by the plan sponsor (or by the plan administrator on behalf of the plan sponsor) for the purpose of communicating with employees and not the public, in accordance with regulations which shall be prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Statement of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may by regulation require that the administrator of any employee benefit plan furnish to each participant and to each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan a statement of the rights of participants and beneficiaries under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Furnishing summary plan information to employers and employee representatives of multiemployer plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to a multiemployer plan subject to this section, within 30 days after the due date under subsection (a)(1) for the filing of the annual report for the fiscal year of the plan, the administrators shall furnish to each employee organization and to each employer with an obligation to contribute to the plan a report that contains&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) whether the plan was in critical or endangered status under section 1085 of this title for such plan year and, if so, include&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:343 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a list of the actions taken by the plan to improve its funding status; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a statement describing how a person may obtain a copy of the plan's funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, as applicable, adopted under section 1085 of this title and the actuarial and financial data that demonstrate any action taken by the plan toward fiscal improvement;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the number of employers that withdrew from the plan during the preceding plan year and the aggregate amount of withdrawal liability assessed, or estimated to be assessed, against such withdrawn employers, as reported on the annual report for the plan year to which the report under this subsection relates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) in the case of a multiemployer plan that has merged with another plan or to which assets and liabilities have been transferred, the actuarial valuation of the assets and liabilities of each affected plan during the year preceding the effective date of the merger or transfer, based upon the most recent data available as of the day before the first day of the plan year, or other valuation method performed under standards and procedures as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) a description as to whether the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) sought or received an amortization extension under section 1084(d) of this title or section 431(d) of title 26 for such plan year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) used the shortfall funding method (as such term is used in section 1085 of this title) for such plan year; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) notification of the right under this section of the recipient to a copy of the annual report filed with the Secretary under subsection (a), summary plan description, summary of any material modification of the plan, upon written request, but that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in no case shall a recipient be entitled to receive more than one copy of any such document described during any one 12-month period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the administrator may make a reasonable charge to cover copying, mailing, and other costs of furnishing copies of information pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of subsection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection waives any other provision under this subchapter requiring plan administrators to provide, upon request, information to employers that have an obligation to contribute under the plan.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Satisfaction of requirements by pension plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a defined benefit plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a defined contribution plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enumeration of plan requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which each participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 3 percent of the normal retirement benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age if he commenced participation at the earliest possible entry age under the plan and served continuously until the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the number of years (not in excess of 331/3) of his participation in the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on compensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 1331/3 percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remain<!-- PDFPage:358 -->ing constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to September 2, 1974, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;year of service&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 1052(a)(3)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 1081(b) of this title (relating to certain insurance contract plans),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but only if an employee's accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 1081(b) of this title were satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant's accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] which benefits under the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) do not exceed social security benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) terminate when such social security benefits commence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee's benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with section 1056(a)(3) of this title, and the payment of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee is not suspended during such plan year pursuant to section 1053(a)(3)(B) of this title, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of any adjustment in the benefit payable under the plan during such plan year attributable to the delay in the distribution of benefits after the attainment of normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any employee who is a highly compensated employee (within the meaning of section 414(q) of title 26) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of precluding discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees within the meaning of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to clause (v) of section 411(b)(1)(H) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this subparagraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(1)(H).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee's account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee's account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 411(b)(2) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of <!-- PDFPage:359 -->this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 1052(b) of this title, determined without regard to section 1052(b)(5) of this title) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) For purposes of this subsection in the case of any maritime industry, 125 days of service shall be treated as a year of participation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H)(i) if a participant's accrued benefit, as determined as of any date under the terms of the plan, would be equal to or greater than that of any similarly situated, younger individual who is or could be a participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Similarly situated</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, a participant is similarly situated to any other individual if such participant is identical to such other individual in every respect (including period of service, compensation, position, date of hire, work history, and any other respect) except for age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Disregard of subsidized early retirement benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In determining the accrued benefit as of any date for purposes of this subparagraph, the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit or retirement-type subsidy shall be disregarded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Accrued benefit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph, the accrued benefit may, under the terms of the plan, be expressed as an annuity payable at normal retirement age, the balance of a hypothetical account, or the current value of the accumulated percentage of the employee's final average compensation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Applicable defined benefit plans.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Interest credits.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the terms of the plan provide that any interest credit (or an equivalent amount) for any plan year shall be at a rate which is not greater than a market rate of return. A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subclause merely because the plan provides for a reasonable minimum guaranteed rate of return or for a rate of return that is equal to the greater of a fixed or variable rate of return.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) <cap-smallcap>Preservation of capital</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;An applicable defined benefit plan shall be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(H) unless the plan provides that an interest credit (or equivalent amount) of less than zero shall in no event result in the account balance or similar amount being less than the aggregate amount of contributions credited to the account.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Required contents for applicable plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan to which this section applies shall provide that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applicable plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) This section shall apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any defined benefit plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any individual account plan which is subject to the funding standards of section 1082 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any participant under any other individual account plan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such plan provides that the participant's nonforfeitable accrued benefit (reduced by any security interest held by the plan by reason of a loan outstanding to such participant) is payable in full, on the death of the participant, to the participant's surviving spouse (or, if there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse consents in the manner required under subsection (c)(2) of this section, to a designated beneficiary),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such participant does not elect the payment of benefits in the form of a life annuity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) with respect to such participant, such plan is not a direct or indirect transferee (in a transfer after December 31, 1984) of a plan which is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) or to which this clause applied with respect to the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Clause (iii) of subparagraph (C) shall apply only with respect to the transferred assets (and income therefrom) if the plan separately accounts for such assets and any income therefrom.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1055_2_target" name="1055_2">2</a></sup> A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(C) or (2) merely because the plan provides that benefits will not be payable to the surviving spouse of the participant unless the participant and such <!-- PDFPage:369 -->spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of the participant's annuity starting date or the date of the participant's death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Plans meeting requirements of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A plan meets the requirements of this section only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under the plan, each participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) may elect at any time during the applicable election period to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit (or both),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the participant elects a waiver under clause (i), may elect the qualified optional survivor annuity at any time during the applicable election period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) may revoke any such election at any time during the applicable election period, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan meets the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each plan shall provide that an election under paragraph (1)(A)(i) shall not take effect unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or a form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within a reasonable period of time before the annuity starting date (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe) a written explanation of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the terms and conditions of the qualified joint and survivor annuity and of the qualified optional survivor annuity,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the participant's right to make, and the effect of, an election under paragraph (1) to waive the joint and survivor annuity form of benefit,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the rights of the participant's spouse under paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an election under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within the applicable period with respect to such participant (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe), a written explanation with respect to the qualified preretirement survivor annuity comparable to that required under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;applicable period&rdquo; means, with respect to a participant, whichever of the following periods ends last:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) The period beginning with the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the participant attains age 35.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) A reasonable period after the individual becomes a participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) A reasonable period ending after paragraph (5) ceases to apply to the participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) A reasonable period ending after this section applies to the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who separates from service before attaining age 35, the applicable period shall be a reasonable period after separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each plan shall provide that, if this section applies to a participant when part or all of the participant's accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant's accrued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requirements comparable to the requirements of paragraph (2) are met with respect to such consent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply with respect to the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit, as the case may be, if such benefit may not be waived (or another beneficiary selected) and if the plan fully subsidizes the costs of such benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) relying on a consent or revocation referred to in paragraph (1)(A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) making a determination under paragraph (2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such consent, revocation, or determination shall be treated as valid for purposes of discharging the plan from liability to the extent of payments made pursuant to such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;applicable election period&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an election to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit, the 180-day period ending on the annuity starting date, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an election to waive the qualified preretirement survivor annuity, the period which begins on the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains age 35 and ends on the date of the participant's death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who is separated from service, the applicable election period <!-- PDFPage:370 -->under subparagraph (B) with respect to benefits accrued before the date of such separation from service shall not begin later than such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) A plan may provide the written explanation described in paragraph (3)(A) after the annuity starting date. In any case to which this subparagraph applies, the applicable election period under paragraph (7) shall not end before the 30th day after the date on which such explanation is provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations limit the application of clause (i), except that such regulations may not limit the period of time by which the annuity starting date precedes the provision of the written explanation other than by providing that the annuity starting date may not be earlier than termination of employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A plan may permit a participant to elect (with any applicable spousal consent) to waive any requirement that the written explanation be provided at least 30 days before the annuity starting date (or to waive the 30-day requirement under subparagraph (A)) if the distribution commences more than 7 days after such explanation is provided.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement date for payment of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall provide that unless the participant otherwise elects, the payment of benefits under the plan to the participant shall begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) occurs the date on which the participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) occurs the 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant commenced participation in the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the participant terminates his service with the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, such plan shall provide that a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Decrease in plan benefits by reason of increases in benefit levels under Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act of 1937</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a participant or beneficiary is receiving benefits under a pension plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a participant is separated from the service and has non-forfeitable rights to benefits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">a plan may not decrease benefits of such a participant by reason of any increase in the benefit levels payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] or any increase in the wage base under such title II, if such increase takes place after September 2, 1974, or (if later) the earlier of the date of first entitlement of such benefits or the date of such separation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forfeiture of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No pension plan may provide that any part of a participant's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from con<!-- PDFPage:375 -->tributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply (1) to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit, or (2) to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 1053(a)(3)(D)(iii) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment or alienation of plan benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall not be taken into account any voluntary and revocable assignment of not to exceed 10 percent of any benefit payment, or of any irrevocable assignment or alienation of benefits executed before September 2, 1974. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any assignment or alienation made for the purposes of defraying plan administration costs. For purposes of this paragraph a loan made to a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated as an assignment or alienation if such loan is secured by the participant's accrued non-forfeitable benefit and is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4975 of title 26 (relating to tax on prohibited transactions) by reason of section 4975(d)(1) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. Each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;qualified domestic relations order&rdquo; means a domestic relations order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the term &ldquo;domestic relations order&rdquo; means any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) each plan to which such order applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subclause (II), the interest rate assumption used in determining the present value shall be the interest rate specified in the plan or, if no rate is specified, 5 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;earliest retirement age&rdquo; means the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the date on which the participant is entitled to a distribution under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the later of the date of the participant attains age 50 or the earliest date on which the participant could begin receiving benefits under the plan if the participant separated from service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F) To the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of section 1055 of this title (and any spouse of the participant shall not be treated as a spouse of the participant for such purposes), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if married for at least 1 year, the surviving former spouse shall be treated as meeting the requirements of section 1055(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:376 --><p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan's procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Each plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) shall be in writing,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) shall provide for the notification of each person specified in a domestic relations order as entitled to payment of benefits under the plan (at the address included in the domestic relations order) of such procedures promptly upon receipt by the plan of the domestic relations order, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) shall permit an alternate payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the alternate payee with respect to a domestic relations order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;segregated amounts&rdquo;) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month period described in this clause is the 18-month period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under the domestic relations order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) treating a domestic relations order as being (or not being) a qualified domestic relations order, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) taking action under subparagraph (H),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan's obligation to the participant and each alternate payee shall be discharged to the extent of any payment made pursuant to such Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Section 1052 of this title shall be applied as if all employees of each of the employers were employed by a single employer.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:384 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Sections 1053 and 1054 of this title shall be applied as if all such employers constituted a single employer, except that the application of any rules with respect to breaks in service shall be made under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in any case in which the employer maintains a plan of a predecessor employer, service for such predecessor shall be treated as service for the employer, and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Plan maintained by controlled group of corporations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of sections 1052, 1053, and 1054 of this title, all employees of all corporations which are members of a controlled group of corporations (within the meaning of section 1563(a) of title 26, determined without regard to section 1563(a)(4) and (e)(3)(C) of title 26) shall be treated as employed by a single employer. With respect to a plan adopted by more than one such corporation, the minimum funding standard of section 1082 of this title shall be determined as if all such employers were a single employer, and allocated to each employer in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Plan of trades or businesses under common control</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of sections 1052, 1053, and 1054 of this title, under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, all employees of trades or businesses (whether or not incorporated) which are under common control shall be treated as employed by a single employer. The regulations prescribed under this subsection shall be based on principles similar to the principles which apply in the case of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rules for eligible combined defined benefit plans and qualified cash or deferred arrangements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in this subsection, this chapter shall be applied to any defined benefit plan or applicable individual account plan which are&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1060_1_target" name="1060_1">1</a></sup> part of an eligible combined plan in the same manner as if each such plan were not a part of the eligible combined plan. In the case of a termination of the defined benefit plan and the applicable defined contribution plan forming part of an eligible combined plan, the plan administrator shall terminate each such plan separately.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible combined plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;eligible combined plan&rdquo; means a plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) which is maintained by an employer which, at the time the plan is established, is a small employer,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) which consists of a defined benefit plan and an applicable individual account plan each of which qualifies under section 401(a) of title 26,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the assets of which are held in a single trust forming part of the plan and are clearly identified and allocated to the defined benefit plan and the applicable individual account plan to the extent necessary for the separate application of this chapter under paragraph (1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) with respect to which the benefit, contribution, vesting, and nondiscrimination requirements of subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), and (F) are met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;small employer&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 4980D(d)(2) of title 26, except that such section shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;500&rdquo; for &ldquo;50&rdquo; each place it appears.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Benefit requirements</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The benefit requirements of this subparagraph are met with respect to the defined benefit plan forming part of the eligible combined plan if the accrued benefit of each participant derived from employer contributions, when expressed as an annual retirement benefit, is not less than the applicable percentage of the participant's final average pay. For purposes of this clause, final average pay shall be determined using the period of consecutive years (not exceeding 5) during which the participant had the greatest aggregate compensation from the employer.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Special rule for applicable defined benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the defined benefit plan under clause (i) is an applicable defined benefit plan as defined in section 1053(f)(3)(B) of this title which meets the interest credit requirements of section 1054(b)(5)(B)(i) of this title, the plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of clause (i) with respect to any plan year if each participant receives pay credit for the year which is not less than the percentage of compensation determined in accordance with the following table:</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Years of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, years of service shall be determined under the rules of paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of section 1053(b) of this title, except that the plan may not disregard any year of service because of a participant making, or failing to make, any elective deferral with respect to the qualified cash or deferred arrangement to which subparagraph (C) applies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the employer is required to make matching contributions on behalf of each employee eligible to participate in the arrangement in an amount equal to 50 percent of the elective contributions of the employee to the extent such elective contributions do not exceed 4 percent of compensation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Rules similar to the rules of clauses (ii) and (iii) of section 401(k)(12)(B) of title 26 shall apply for purposes of this clause.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Nonelective contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">An applicable individual account plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) because the employer makes nonelective contributions under the plan but such contributions shall not be taken into account in determining whether the requirements of clause (i)(II) are met.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Vesting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The vesting requirements of this subparagraph are met if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a defined benefit plan forming part of an eligible combined plan an employee who has completed at least 3 years of service has a nonforfeitable right to 100 percent of the employee's accrued benefit under the plan derived from employer contributions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of an applicable individual account plan forming part of eligible combined plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) an employee has a nonforfeitable right to any matching contribution made under the qualified cash or deferred arrangement included in such plan by an employer with respect to any elective contribution, including matching contributions in excess of the contributions required under subparagraph (C)(i)(II), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan to which this part applies shall satisfy the minimum funding standard applicable to the plan for any plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum funding standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan shall be treated as satisfying the minimum funding standard for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan which is a single-employer plan, the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which, in the aggregate, are not less than the minimum required contribution determined under section 1083 of this title for the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a money purchase plan which is a single-employer plan, the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which are required under the terms of the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the employers make contributions to or under the plan for any plan year which, in the aggregate, are sufficient to ensure that the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency under section 1084 of this title as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liability for contributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amount of any contribution required by this section (including any required installments under paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 1083(j) of this title) shall be paid by the employer responsible for making contributions to or under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Joint and several liability where employer member of controlled group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the employer referred to in paragraph (1) is a member of a controlled group, each member of such group shall be jointly and severally liable for payment of such contributions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Multiemployer plans in critical status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a multiemployer plan for any plan year in which the plan is in critical status pursuant to section 1085 of this title. This paragraph shall only apply if the plan sponsor adopts a rehabilitation plan in accordance with section 1085(e) of this title and complies with the terms of such rehabilitation plan (and any updates or modifications of the plan).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Variance from minimum funding standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Waiver in case of business hardship</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an employer is (or in the case of a multiemployer plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan are) unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year <!-- PDFPage:390 -->without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the Secretary of the Treasury may, subject to subparagraph (C), waive the requirements of subsection (a) for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effects of waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a waiver is granted under subparagraph (A) for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a single-employer plan, the minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for the plan year shall be reduced by the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1083(e) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the funding standard account shall be credited under section 1084(b)(3)(C) of this title with the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1084(b)(2)(C) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver of amortized portion not allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may not waive under subparagraph (A) any portion of the minimum funding standard under subsection (a) for a plan year which is attributable to any waived funding deficiency for any preceding plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of business hardship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the factors taken into account in determining temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) shall include (but shall not be limited to) whether or not&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if such Secretary determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this paragraph.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Restriction on plan amendments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No amendment of a plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan shall be adopted if a waiver under this subsection or an extension of time under section 1084(d) of this title is in effect with respect to the plan, or if a plan amendment described in subsection (d)(2) which reduces the accrued benefit of any participant has been made at any time in the preceding 12 months (24 months in the case of a multiemployer plan). If a plan is amended in violation of the preceding sentence, any such waiver, or extension of time, shall not apply to any plan year ending on or after the date on which such amendment is adopted.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any plan amendment which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Secretary of the Treasury determines to be reasonable and which provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) only repeals an amendment described in subsection (d)(2), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, any amendment applying to a plan year which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is adopted after the close of such plan year but no later than 2&frac12; months after the close of the plan year (or, in the case of a multiemployer plan, no later than 2 years after the close of such plan year),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the beginning of the first plan year to which the amendment applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) does not reduce the accrued benefit of any participant determined as of the time of <!-- PDFPage:392 -->adoption except to the extent required by the circumstances,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall, at the election of the plan administrator, be deemed to have been made on the first day of such plan year. No amendment described in this paragraph which reduces the accrued benefits of any participant shall take effect unless the plan administrator files a notice with the Secretary of the Treasury notifying him of such amendment and such Secretary has approved such amendment, or within 90 days after the date on which such notice was filed, failed to disapprove such amendment. No amendment described in this subsection shall be approved by the Secretary of the Treasury unless such Secretary determines that such amendment is necessary because of a temporary substantial business hardship (as determined under subsection (c)(2)) or a substantial business hardship (as so determined) in the case of a multiemployer plan and that a waiver under subsection (c) (or, in the case of a multiemployer plan, any extension of the amortization period under section 1084(d) of this title) is unavailable or inadequate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Controlled group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (<em>o</em>) of section 414 of title 26.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 1082 of this title, the accumulated funding deficiency of a multiemployer plan for any plan year is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in paragraph (2), the amount, determined as of the end of the plan year, equal to the excess (if any) of the total charges to the funding standard account of the plan for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year for which this part applies to the plan) over the total credits to such account for such years, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the multiemployer plan is in reorganization for any plan year, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan determined under section 1423 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding standard account</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Account required</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Charges to account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a plan which comes into existence on or after January 1, 2008, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this section applies, over a period of 15 plan years,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:409 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 15 plan years,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1082(c)(3) of this title) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 15 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under section 1082(b)(3)(D) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 20 years the contributions which would be required to be made under the plan but for the provisions of section 1082(c)(7)(A)(i)(I) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credits to account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 15 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 15 plan years, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 15 plan years,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1082(c)(3) of this title) for the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standard under section 1085 of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006), the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for amounts first amortized in plan years before 2008</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any amount amortized under section 1082(b) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006) over any period beginning with a plan year beginning before 2008, in lieu of the amortization described in paragraphs (2)(B) and (3)(B), such amount shall continue to be amortized under such section as so in effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Combining and offsetting amounts to be amortized</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Withdrawal liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustments when a multiemployer plan leaves reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a multiemployer plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but</p>
<!-- PDFPage:410 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 1423(a) of this title as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Election for deferral of charge for portion of net experience loss</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an election is in effect under section 1082(b)(7)(F) of this title (as in effect on the day before August 17, 2006) for any plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged in the plan year to which the portion of the net experience loss deferred by such election was deferred with the amount so deferred (and paragraph (2)(B)(iii) shall not apply to the amount so charged).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount of any financial assistance from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation to any plan, and any repayment of such amount, shall be taken into account under this section and section 1082 of this title in such manner as is determined by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Short-term benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that any plan amendment increases the unfunded past service liability under the plan by reason of an increase in benefits which are not payable as a life annuity but are payable under the terms of the plan for a period that does not exceed 14 years from the effective date of the amendment, paragraph (2)(B)(ii) shall be applied separately with respect to such increase in unfunded past service liability by substituting the number of years of the period during which such benefits are payable for &ldquo;15&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Special relief rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Amortization of net investment losses</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A multiemployer plan with respect to which the solvency test under subparagraph (C) is met may treat the portion of any experience loss or gain attributable to net investment losses incurred in either or both of the first two plan years ending after August 31, 2008, as an item separate from other experience losses, to be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over the period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) beginning with the plan year in which such portion is first recognized in the actuarial value of assets, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) ending with the last plan year in the 30-plan year period beginning with the plan year in which such net investment loss was incurred.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Coordination with extensions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If this subparagraph applies for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) no extension of the amortization period under clause (i) shall be allowed under subsection (d), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) if an extension was granted under subsection (d) for any plan year before the election to have this subparagraph apply to the plan year, such extension shall not result in such amortization period exceeding 30 years.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Net investment losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Net investment losses shall be determined in the manner prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the difference between actual and expected returns (including any difference attributable to any criminally fraudulent investment arrangement).</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Criminally fraudulent investment arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The determination as to whether an arrangement is a criminally fraudulent investment arrangement shall be made under rules substantially similar to the rules prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of section 165 of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Expanded smoothing period</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A multiemployer plan with respect to which the solvency test under subparagraph (C) is met may change its asset valuation method in a manner which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) provides that for either or both of the first 2 plan years beginning after August 31, 2008, the value of plan assets at any time shall not be less than 80 percent or greater than 130 percent of the fair market value of such assets at such time, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) makes both changes described in subclauses (I) and (II) to such method.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Asset valuation methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If this subparagraph applies for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:411 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the Secretary of the Treasury shall not treat the asset valuation method of the plan as unreasonable solely because of the changes in such method described in clause (i), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such changes shall be deemed approved by such Secretary under section 1082(d)(1) of this title and section 412(d)(1) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Amortization of reduction in unfunded accrued liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If this subparagraph and subparagraph (A) both apply for any plan year, the plan shall treat any reduction in unfunded accrued liability resulting from the application of this subparagraph as a separate experience amortization base, to be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 30 plan years rather than the period such liability would otherwise be amortized over.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Solvency test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The solvency test under this paragraph is met only if the plan actuary certifies that the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay expected benefits and anticipated expenditures over the amortization period, taking into account the changes in the funding standard account under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Restriction on benefit increases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If subparagraph (A) or (B) apply to a multiemployer plan for any plan year, then, in addition to any other applicable restrictions on benefit increases, a plan amendment increasing benefits may not go into effect during either of the 2 plan years immediately following such plan year unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the plan actuary certifies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any such increase is paid for out of additional contributions not allocated to the plan immediately before the application of this paragraph to the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the plan's funded percentage and projected credit balances for such 2 plan years are reasonably expected to be at least as high as such percentage and balances would have been if the benefit increase had not been adopted, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amendment is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 or to comply with other applicable law.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan sponsor of a plan to which this paragraph applies shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) give notice of such application to participants and beneficiaries of the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) inform the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation of such application in such form and manner as the Director of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determinations to be made under funding method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Valuation of assets</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this part, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulation prescribe for plan years beginning after December 31, 1999, mortality tables to be used in determining current liability under this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of disabilities occurring in plan years beginning after December 31, 1994, the tables under subclause (I) shall apply only with respect to individuals described in such subclause who are disabled within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] and the regulations thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall periodically (at least every 5 years) review any tables in effect under this subparagraph and shall, to the extent such Secretary determines necessary, by regulation update the tables to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, such Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under such subclause.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding paragraph (3)(A), the interest rate used under the plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Annual valuation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, a determination of experience gains and losses and a valuation of the plan's liability shall be made not less frequently than once every year, except that such determination shall be made more frequently to the extent required in particular cases under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Information under clause (ii) shall, in accordance with regulations, be actuarially adjusted to reflect significant differences in participants.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Limitation</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the Secretary of the Treasury shall extend the amortization period for the period of time (not in excess of 5 years) specified in the application. Such extension shall be in addition to any extension under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A certification with respect to a multiemployer plan is described in this subparagraph if the plan's actuary certifies that, based on reasonable assumptions&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the plan sponsor has adopted a plan to improve the plan's funding status,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay expected benefits and anticipated expenditures over the amortization period as extended, and</p>

Such extension shall be in addition to any extension under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may grant an extension under subparagraph (A) if such Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such extension would carry out the purposes of this chapter and would provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the failure to permit such extension would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) result in a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Action by Secretary of the Treasury</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">This part shall apply to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003(a) of this title (and not exempted under section 1003(b) of this title), other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any agreement described in section 736 of title 26, which provides payments to a retired partner or deceased partner or a deceased partner's successor in interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Securities or policies deemed to be included in plan assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of a plan which invests in any security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 et seq.], the assets of such plan shall be deemed to include such security but shall not, solely by reason of such investment, be deemed to include any assets of such investment company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a plan to which a guaranteed benefit policy is issued by an insurer, the assets of such plan shall be deemed to include such policy, but shall not, solely by reason of the issuance of such policy, be deemed to include any assets of such insurer. For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; means an insurance company, insurance service, or insurance organization, qualified to do business in a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The term &ldquo;guaranteed benefit policy&rdquo; means an insurance policy or contract to the extent that such policy or contract provides for benefits the amount of which is guaranteed by the insurer. Such term includes any surplus in a separate account, but excludes any other portion of a separate account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Clarification of application of ERISA to insurance company general accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Not later than June 30, 1997, the Secretary shall issue proposed regulations to provide guidance for the purpose of determining, in cases where an insurer issues 1 or more policies to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan (and such policies are supported by assets of such insurer's general account), which assets held by the insurer (other than plan assets held in its separate accounts) constitute assets of the plan for purposes of this part and section 4975 of title 26 and to provide guidance with respect to the application of this subchapter to the general account assets of insurers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The proposed regulations under subparagraph (A) shall be subject to public notice and comment until September 30, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall issue final regulations providing the guidance described in subparagraph (A) not later than December 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Such regulations shall only apply with respect to policies which are issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998, to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan which is supported by assets of such insurer's general account. With respect to policies issued on or before December 31, 1998, such regulations shall take effect at the end of the 18-month period following the date on which such regulations become final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall ensure that the regulations issued under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are administratively feasible, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) protect the interests and rights of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries (including meeting the requirements of paragraph (3)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The regulations prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) shall require, in connection with any policy issued by an insurer to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan to the extent that the policy is not a guaranteed benefit policy (as defined in subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that a plan fiduciary totally independent of the insurer authorize the purchase of such policy (unless such purchase is a transaction exempt under section 1108(b)(5) of this title),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the insurer describe (in such form and manner as shall be prescribed in such regulations), in annual reports and in policies issued to the policyholder after the date on which such regulations are issued in final form pursuant to paragraph (1)(C)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a description of the method by which any income and expenses of the insurer's general account are allocated to the policy during the term of the policy and upon the termination of the policy, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for each report, the actual return to the plan under the policy and such other financial information as the Secretary may deem appropriate for the period covered by each such annual report,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that the insurer disclose to the plan fiduciary the extent to which alternative arrangements supported by assets of separate accounts of the insurer (which generally hold plan assets) are available, whether there is a right under the policy to transfer funds to a separate account and the terms governing any such right, and the extent to which support by assets of the insurer's general account and support by assets of separate accounts of the insurer might pose differing risks to the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that the insurer manage those assets of the insurer which are assets of such insurer's general account (irrespective of whether any such assets are plan assets) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, taking into account all obligations supported by such enterprise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:426 --><p class="statutory-body">(4) Compliance by the insurer with all requirements of the regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deemed compliance by such insurer with sections 1104, 1106, and 1107 of this title with respect to those assets of the insurer's general account which support a policy described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), any regulations issued under paragraph (1) shall not take effect before the date on which such regulations become final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No person shall be subject to liability under this part or section 4975 of title 26 for conduct which occurred before the date which is 18 months following the date described in subparagraph (A) on the basis of a claim that the assets of an insurer (other than plan assets held in a separate account) constitute assets of the plan, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as otherwise provided by the Secretary in regulations intended to prevent avoidance of the regulations issued under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) as provided in an action brought by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2) or (5) of section 1132(a) of this title for a breach of fiduciary responsibilities which would also constitute a violation of Federal or State criminal law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall bring a cause of action described in clause (ii) if a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a breach described in clause (ii) has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the application of any Federal criminal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;policy&rdquo; includes a contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prudent man standard of care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to sections 1103(c) and (d), 1342, and 1344 of this title, a fiduciary shall discharge his duties with respect to a plan solely in the interest of the participants and beneficiaries and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for the exclusive purpose of:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) providing benefits to participants and their beneficiaries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) defraying reasonable expenses of administering the plan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with the care, skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) by diversifying the investments of the plan so as to minimize the risk of large losses, unless under the circumstances it is clearly prudent not to do so; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in accordance with the documents and instruments governing the plan insofar as such documents and instruments are consistent with the provisions of this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an eligible individual account plan (as defined in section 1107(d)(3) of this title), the diversification requirement of paragraph (1)(C) and the prudence requirement (only to the extent that it requires diversification) of paragraph (1)(B) is not violated by acquisition or holding of qualifying employer real property or qualifying employer securities (as defined in section 1107(d)(4) and (5) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Indicia of ownership of assets outside jurisdiction of district courts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as authorized by the Secretary by regulations, no fiduciary may maintain the indicia of ownership of any assets of a plan outside the jurisdiction of the district courts of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Control over assets by participant or beneficiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In the case of a pension plan which provides for individual accounts and permits a participant or beneficiary to exercise control over the assets in his account, if a participant or beneficiary exercises control over the assets in his account (as determined under regulations of the Secretary)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such participant or beneficiary shall not be deemed to be a fiduciary by reason of such exercise, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) no person who is otherwise a fiduciary shall be liable under this part for any loss, or by reason of any breach, which results from such participant's or beneficiary's exercise of control, except that this clause shall not apply in connection with such participant or beneficiary for any blackout period during which the ability of such participant or beneficiary to direct the investment of the assets in his or her account is suspended by a plan sponsor or fiduciary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a person referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) meets the requirements of this subchapter in connection with authorizing and implementing the blackout period, any person who is otherwise a fiduciary shall not be liable under this subchapter for any loss occurring during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;blackout period&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 1021(i)(7) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a simple retirement account established pursuant to a qualified salary reduction arrangement under section 408(p) of title 26, a participant or beneficiary shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be treated as exercising control over the assets in the account upon the earliest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an affirmative election among investment options with respect to the initial investment of any contribution,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a rollover to any other simple retirement account or individual retirement plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) one year after the simple retirement account is established.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No reports, other than those required under section 1021(g) of this title, shall be required with respect to a simple retirement account established pursuant to such a qualified salary reduction arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a pension plan which makes a transfer to an individual retirement account or annuity of a designated trustee or issuer under section 401(a)(31)(B) of title 26, the participant or beneficiary shall, for purposes of paragraph (1), be treated as exercising control over the assets in the account or annuity upon&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a rollover of all or a portion of the amount to another individual retirement account or annuity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) one year after the transfer is made; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a transfer that is made in a manner consistent with guidance provided by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In any case in which a qualified change in investment options occurs in connection with an individual account plan, a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated for purposes of paragraph (1) as not exercising control over the assets in his account in connection with such change if the requirements of subparagraph (C) are met in connection with such change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;qualified change in investment options&rdquo; means, in connection with an individual account plan, a change in the investment options offered to the participant or beneficiary under the terms of the plan, under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the account of the participant or beneficiary is reallocated among one or more remaining or new investment options which are offered in lieu of one or more investment options offered immediately prior to the effective date of the change, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the stated characteristics of the remaining or new investment options provided under clause (i), including characteristics relating to <!-- PDFPage:430 -->risk and rate of return, are, as of immediately after the change, reasonably similar to those of the existing investment options as of immediately before the change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The requirements of this subparagraph are met in connection with a qualified change in investment options if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) at least 30 days and no more than 60 days prior to the effective date of the change, the plan administrator furnishes written notice of the change to the participants and beneficiaries, including information comparing the existing and new investment options and an explanation that, in the absence of affirmative investment instructions from the participant or beneficiary to the contrary, the account of the participant or beneficiary will be invested in the manner described in subparagraph (B),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the participant or beneficiary has not provided to the plan administrator, in advance of the effective date of the change, affirmative investment instructions contrary to the change, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the investments under the plan of the participant or beneficiary as in effect immediately prior to the effective date of the change were the product of the exercise by such participant or beneficiary of control over the assets of the account within the meaning of paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Default investment arrangements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of paragraph (1), a participant or beneficiary in an individual account plan meeting the notice requirements of subparagraph (B) shall be treated as exercising control over the assets in the account with respect to the amount of contributions and earnings which, in the absence of an investment election by the participant or beneficiary, are invested by the plan in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary. The regulations under this subparagraph shall provide guidance on the appropriateness of designating default investments that include a mix of asset classes consistent with capital preservation or long-term capital appreciation, or a blend of both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Notice requirements.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirements of this subparagraph are met if each participant or beneficiary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) receives, within a reasonable period of time before each plan year, a notice explaining the employee's right under the plan to designate how contributions and earnings will be invested and explaining how, in the absence of any investment election by the participant or beneficiary, such contributions and earnings will be invested, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) has a reasonable period of time after receipt of such notice and before the beginning of the plan year to make such designation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Form of notice</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The requirements of clauses (i) and (ii) of section 401(k)(12)(D) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the notices described in this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Plan terminations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, in connection with the termination of a pension plan which is a single-employer plan, there is an election to establish or maintain a qualified replacement plan, or to increase benefits, as provided under section 4980(d) of title 26, a fiduciary shall discharge the fiduciary's duties under this subchapter and subchapter III of this chapter in accordance with the following requirements:</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Circumstances giving rise to liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to any liability which he may have under any other provisions of this part, a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall be liable for a breach of fiduciary responsibility of another fiduciary with respect to the same plan in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if he participates knowingly in, or knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if, by his failure to comply with section 1104(a)(1) of this title in the administration of his specific responsibilities which give rise to his status as a fiduciary, he has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a breach; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if he has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable <!-- PDFPage:432 -->efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assets held by two or more trustees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section and in section 1103(a)(1) and (2) of this title, if the assets of a plan are held by two or more trustees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each shall use reasonable care to prevent a co-trustee from committing a breach; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) they shall jointly manage and control the assets of the plan, except that nothing in this subparagraph (B) shall preclude any agreement, authorized by the trust instrument, allocating specific responsibilities, obligations, or duties among trustees, in which event a trustee to whom certain responsibilities, obligations, or duties have not been allocated shall not be liable by reason of this subparagraph (B) either individually or as a trustee for any loss resulting to the plan arising from the acts or omissions on the part of another trustee to whom such responsibilities, obligations, or duties have been allocated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall limit any liability that a fiduciary may have under subsection (a) of this section or any other provision of this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a plan the assets of which are held in more than one trust, a trustee shall not be liable under paragraph (1) except with respect to an act or omission of a trustee of a trust of which he is a trustee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No trustee shall be liable under this subsection for following instructions referred to in section 1103(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of fiduciary responsibility; designated persons to carry out fiduciary responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The instrument under which a plan is maintained may expressly provide for procedures (A) for allocating fiduciary responsibilities (other than trustee responsibilities) among named fiduciaries, and (B) for named fiduciaries to designate persons other than named fiduciaries to carry out fiduciary responsibilities (other than trustee responsibilities) under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a plan expressly provides for a procedure described in paragraph (1), and pursuant to such procedure any fiduciary responsibility of a named fiduciary is allocated to any person, or a person is designated to carry out any such responsibility, then such named fiduciary shall not be liable for an act or omission of such person in carrying out such responsibility except to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the named fiduciary violated section 1104(a)(1) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) with respect to such allocation or designation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) with respect to the establishment or implementation of the procedure under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in continuing the allocation or designation; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the named fiduciary would otherwise be liable in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;trustee responsibility&rdquo; means any responsibility provided in the plan's trust instrument (if any) to manage or control the assets of the plan, other than a power under the trust instrument of a named fiduciary to appoint an investment manager in accordance with section 1102(c)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investment managers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an investment manager or managers have been appointed under section 1102(c)(3) of this title, then, notwithstanding subsections (a)(2) and (3) and subsection (b) of this section, no trustee shall be liable for the acts or omissions of such investment manager or managers, or be under an obligation to invest or otherwise manage any asset of the plan which is subject to the management of such investment manager.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall relieve any trustee of any liability under this part for any act of such trustee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grant of exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish an exemption procedure for purposes of this subsection. Pursuant to such procedure, he may grant a conditional or unconditional exemption of any fiduciary or transaction, or class of fiduciaries or transactions, from all or part of the restrictions imposed by sections 1106 and 1107(a) of this title. Action under this subsection may be taken only after consultation and coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury. An exemption granted under this section shall not relieve a fiduciary from any other applicable provision of this chapter. The Secretary may not grant an exemption under this subsection unless he finds that such exemption is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) administratively feasible,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before granting an exemption under this subsection from section 1106(a) or 1107(a) of this title, the Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the exemption, shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and shall afford interested persons opportunity to present views.

A loan made by a plan shall not fail to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence by reason of a loan repayment suspension described under section 414(u)(4) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Contracting or making reasonable arrangements with a party in interest for office space, or legal, accounting, or other services necessary for the establishment or operation of the plan, if no more than reasonable compensation is paid therefor.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:437 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A loan to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 1107(d)(6) of this title), if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the plan gives collateral to a party in interest for such loan, such collateral may consist only of qualifying employer securities (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The investment of all or part of a plan's assets in deposits which bear a reasonable interest rate in a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan covers only employees of such bank or other institution and employees of affiliates of such bank or other institution, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such investment is expressly authorized by a provision of the plan or by a fiduciary (other than such bank or institution or affiliate thereof) who is expressly empowered by the plan to so instruct the trustee with respect to such investment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a party in interest which is wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the employer maintaining the plan, or by any person which is a party in interest with respect to the plan, but only if the total premiums and annuity considerations written by such insurers for life insurance, health insurance, or annuities for all plans (and their employers) with respect to which such insurers are parties in interest (not including premiums or annuity considerations written by the employer maintaining the plan) do not exceed 5 percent of the total premiums and annuity considerations written for all lines of insurance in that year by such insurers (not including premiums or annuity considerations written by the employer maintaining the plan).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The providing of any ancillary service by a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan, and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such bank or similar financial institution has adopted adequate internal safeguards which assure that the providing of such ancillary service is consistent with sound banking and financial practice, as determined by Federal or State supervisory authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which such ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by such bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Secretary after consultation with Federal and State supervisory authority), and adherence to such guidelines would reasonably preclude such bank or similar financial institution from providing such ancillary service (i) in an excessive or unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such ancillary services shall not be provided at more than reasonable compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The exercise of a privilege to convert securities, to the extent provided in regulations of the Secretary, but only if the plan receives no less than adequate consideration pursuant to such conversion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (e) of this section are met with respect to such stock,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the later of the date on which the stock was acquired by the plan, or January 1, 1975, such stock constituted a qualifying employer security (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title as then in effect), and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1112. Bonding</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requisite bonding of plan officials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every fiduciary of an employee benefit plan and every person who handles funds or other property of such a plan (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;plan official&rdquo;) shall be bonded as provided in this section; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) where such plan is one under which the only assets from which benefits are paid are the general assets of a union or of an employer, the administrator, officers, and employees of such plan shall be exempt from the bonding requirements of this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) no bond shall be required of any entity which is registered as a broker or a dealer under section 78<em>o</em>(b) of title 15 if the broker or dealer is subject to the fidelity bond requirements of a self-regulatory organization (within the meaning of section 78c(a)(26) of title 15).<sup><a href="#1112_1_target" name="1112_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) no bond shall be required of a fiduciary (or of any director, officer, or employee of such fiduciary) if such fiduciary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is authorized under such laws to exercise trust powers or to conduct an insurance business;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:448 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) has at all times a combined capital and surplus in excess of such a minimum amount as may be established by regulations issued by the Secretary, which amount shall be at least $1,000,000. Paragraph (2) shall apply to a bank or other financial institution which is authorized to exercise trust powers and the deposits of which are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, only if such bank or institution meets bonding or similar requirements under State law which the Secretary determines are at least equivalent to those imposed on banks by Federal law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of such bond shall be fixed at the beginning of each fiscal year of the plan. Such amount shall be not less than 10 per centum of the amount of funds handled. In no case shall such bond be less than $1,000 nor more than $500,000, except that the Secretary, after due notice and opportunity for hearing to all interested parties, and after consideration of the record, may prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000, subject to the 10 per centum limitation of the preceding sentence. For purposes of fixing the amount of such bond, the amount of funds handled shall be determined by the funds handled by the person, group, or class to be covered by such bond and by their predecessor or predecessors, if any, during the preceding reporting year, or if the plan has no preceding reporting year, the amount of funds to be handled during the current reporting year by such person, group, or class, estimated as provided in regulations of the Secretary. Such bond shall provide protection to the plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the plan official, directly or through connivance with others. Any bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to sections 9304&ndash;9308 of title 31. Any bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary, including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class. In the case of a plan that holds employer securities (within the meaning of section 1107(d)(1) of this title), this subsection shall be applied by substituting &ldquo;$1,000,000&rdquo; for &ldquo;$500,000&rdquo; each place it appears.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unlawful acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any plan official to whom subsection (a) of this section applies, to receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control of any of the funds or other property of any employee benefit plan, without being bonded as required by subsection (a) of this section and it shall be unlawful for any plan official of such plan, or any other person having authority to direct the performance of such functions, to permit such functions, or any of them, to be performed by any plan official, with respect to whom the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have not been met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conflict of interest prohibited in procuring bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any person to procure any bond required by subsection (a) of this section from any surety or other company or through any agent or broker in whose business operations such plan or any party in interest in such plan has any control or significant financial interest, direct or indirect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusiveness of statutory basis for bonding requirement for persons handling funds or other property of employee benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in any other provision of law shall require any person, required to be bonded as provided in subsection (a) of this section because he handles funds or other property of an employee benefit plan, to be bonded insofar as the handling by such person of the funds or other property of such plan is concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section including exempting a plan from the requirements of this section where he finds that (1) other bonding arrangements or (2) the overall financial condition of the plan would be adequate to protect the interests of the beneficiaries and participants. When, in the opinion of the Secretary, the administrator of a plan offers adequate evidence of the financial responsibility of the plan, or that other bonding arrangements would provide adequate protection of the beneficiaries and participants, he may exempt such plan from the requirements of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Automatic contribution arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, this subchapter shall supersede any law of a State which would directly or indirectly prohibit or restrict the inclusion in any plan of an automatic contribution arrangement. The Secretary may prescribe regulations which would establish minimum standards that such an arrangement would be required to satisfy in order for this subsection to apply in the case of such arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;automatic contribution arrangement&rdquo; means an arrangement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under which a participant may elect to have the plan sponsor make payments as contributions under the plan on behalf of the participant, or to the participant directly in cash,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) under which a participant is treated as having elected to have the plan sponsor make such contributions in an amount equal to a uniform percentage of compensation provided under the plan until the participant specifically elects not to have such contributions made (or specifically elects to have such contributions made at a different percentage), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) under which such contributions are invested in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary under section 1104(c)(5) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The plan administrator of an automatic contribution arrangement shall, within a reasonable period before such plan year, provide to each participant to whom the arrangement applies for such plan year notice of the participant's rights and obligations under the arrangement which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is sufficiently accurate and comprehensive to apprise the participant of such rights and obligations, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A notice shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of subparagraph (A) with respect to a participant unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the notice includes an explanation of the participant's right under the arrangement not to have elective contributions made on the participant's behalf (or to elect to have such contributions made at a different percentage),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the participant has a reasonable period of time, after receipt of the notice described in clause (i) and before the first elective contribution is made, to make such election, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the notice explains how contributions made under the arrangement will be invested in the absence of any investment election by the participant.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1144a. Clarification of church welfare plan status under State insurance law</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the status of a church plan that is a welfare plan under provisions of a State insurance law described in subsection (b) of this section, such a church plan (and any trust under such plan) shall be deemed to be a plan sponsored by a single employer that reimburses costs from general church assets, or purchases insurance coverage with general church assets, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State insurance law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State insurance law described in this subsection is a law that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) requires a church plan, or an organization described in section 414(e)(3)(A) of title 26 and section 1002(33)(C)(i) of this title to the extent that it is administering or funding such a plan, to be licensed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) relates solely to the solvency or insolvency of a church plan (including participation in State guaranty funds and associations).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Church plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;church plan&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 414(e) of title 26 and section 1002(33) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reimburses costs from general church assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;reimburses costs from general church assets&rdquo; means engaging in an activity that is not the spreading of risk solely for the purposes of the provisions of State insurance laws described in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Welfare plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;welfare plan&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) means any church plan to the extent that such plan provides medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprenticeship or other training programs, or day care centers, scholarship funds, or prepaid legal services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not include any entity, such as a health insurance issuer described in section 9832(b)(2) of title 26 or a health maintenance organization described in section 9832(b)(3) of title 26, or any other organization that does business with the church plan or organization sponsoring or maintaining such a plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for purposes of enforcing provisions of State insurance laws that apply to a church plan that is a welfare plan, the church plan shall be subject to State enforcement as if the church plan were an insurer licensed by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the application of this section is limited to determining the status of a church plan that is a welfare plan under the provisions of State insurance laws described in subsection (b) of this section. This section shall not otherwise be construed to recharacterize the status, or modify or affect the rights, of any plan participant or beneficiary, including participants or beneficiaries who make plan contributions.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Qualified medical child support order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified medical child support order&rdquo; means a medical child support order&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Restriction on new types or forms of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A medical child support order meets the requirements of this paragraph only if such order does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan, except to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of a law relating to medical child support described in section 1908 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396g&ndash;1] (as added by section 13822&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1169_1_target" name="1169_1">1</a></sup> of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Procedural requirements</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Establishment of procedures for determining qualified status of orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each group health plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine whether medical child support orders are qualified medical child support orders and to administer the provision of benefits under such qualified orders. Such procedures&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Enrollment of child in plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which an appropriately completed National Medical Support Notice is issued in the case of a child of a participant under a group health plan who is a noncustodial parent of the child, and the Notice is deemed under clause (i) to be a qualified medical child support order, the plan administrator, within 40 business days after the date of the Notice, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) notify the State agency issuing the Notice with respect to such child whether coverage of the child is available <!-- PDFPage:481 -->under the terms of the plan and, if so, whether such child is covered under the plan and either the effective date of the coverage or, if necessary, any steps to be taken by the custodial parent (or by the official of a State or political subdivision thereof substituted for the name of such child pursuant to paragraph (3)(A)) to effectuate the coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) provide to the custodial parent (or such substituted official) a description of the coverage available and any forms or documents necessary to effectuate such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as requiring a group health plan, upon receipt of a National Medical Support Notice, to provide benefits under the plan (or eligibility for such benefits) in addition to benefits (or eligibility for benefits) provided under the terms of the plan as of immediately before receipt of such Notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Actions taken by fiduciaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in treating a medical child support order as being (or not being) a qualified medical child support order, then the plan's obligation to the participant and each alternate recipient shall be discharged to the extent of any payment made pursuant to such act of the fiduciary.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Treatment as beneficiary generally</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any payment for benefits made by a group health plan pursuant to a medical child support order in reimbursement for expenses paid by an alternate recipient or an alternate recipient's custodial parent or legal guardian shall be made to the alternate recipient or the alternate recipient's custodial parent or legal guardian.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Payment to State official treated as satisfaction of plan's obligation to make payment to alternate recipient</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payment of benefits by a group health plan to an official of a State or a political subdivision thereof whose name and address have been substituted for the address of an alternate recipient in a qualified medical child support order, pursuant to paragraph (3)(A), shall be treated, for purposes of this subchapter, as payment of benefits to the alternate recipient.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Compliance by plans with assignment of rights</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Enrollment and provision of benefits without regard to medicaid eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan shall provide that, in enrolling an individual as a participant or beneficiary or in determining or making any payments for benefits of an individual as a participant or beneficiary, the fact that the individual is eligible for or is provided medical assistance under a State plan for medical assistance approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] will not be taken into account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan shall provide that, to the extent that payment has been made under a State plan for medical assistance approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] in any case in which a group health plan has a legal liability to make payment for items or services constituting such assistance, payment for benefits under the plan will be made in accordance with any State law which provides that the State has acquired the rights with respect to a participant to such payment for such items or services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Group health plan coverage of dependent children in cases of adoption</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Coverage effective upon placement for adoption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which a group health plan provides coverage for dependent children of participants or beneficiaries, such plan shall provide benefits to dependent children placed with participants or beneficiaries for adoption under the same terms and conditions as apply in the case of dependent children who are natural children of participants or beneficiaries under the plan, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Restrictions based on preexisting conditions at time of placement for adoption prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan may not restrict coverage under the plan of any dependent child adopted by a participant or beneficiary, or placed with a participant or beneficiary for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of such child at the time that such child would otherwise become eligible for cov<!-- PDFPage:482 -->erage under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the participant or beneficiary is eligible for coverage under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) apply the applicable lifetime limit both to the medical and surgical benefits to which it otherwise would apply and to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and not distinguish in the application of such limit between such medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not include any aggregate lifetime limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is less than the applicable lifetime limit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan or coverage that is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and that includes no or different aggregate lifetime limits on different categories of medical and surgical benefits, the Secretary shall establish rules under which subparagraph (B) is applied to such plan or coverage with respect to mental health and substance use disorder benefits by substituting for the applicable lifetime limit an average aggregate lifetime limit that is computed taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime limits applicable to such categories.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the financial requirements applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage), and there are no separate cost sharing requirements that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether such employer is a small employer shall be based on the average number of employees that it is reasonably expected such employer will employ on business days in the current calendar year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Predecessors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any reference in this paragraph to an employer shall include a reference to any predecessor of such employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;medically necessary leave of absence&rdquo; means, with respect to a dependent child described in subsection (b)(2) in connection with a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such plan, a leave of absence of such child from a postsecondary educational institution (including an institution of higher education as defined in section 1002 of title 20), or any other change in enrollment of such child at such an institution, that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date that is 1 year after the first day of the medically necessary leave of absence; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was enrolled in the plan or coverage, on the basis of being a student at a postsecondary educational institution (as described in subsection (a)), immediately before the first day of the medically necessary leave of absence involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certification by physician</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall apply to a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered by an issuer in connection with such plan only if the plan or issuer of the coverage has received written certification by a treating physician of the dependent child which states that the child is suffering from a serious illness or injury and that the leave of absence (or other change of enrollment) described in subsection (a) is medically necessary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a dependent child of a participant or beneficiary is in a period of coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan, pursuant to a medically necessary leave of absence of the child described in subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the manner in which the participant or beneficiary is covered under the plan changes, whether through a change in health insurance coverage or health insurance issuer, a change between health insurance coverage and self-insured coverage, or otherwise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the coverage as so changed continues to provide coverage of beneficiaries as dependent children,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">this section shall apply to coverage of the child under the changed coverage for the remainder of the period of the medically necessary leave of absence of the dependent child under the plan in the same manner as it would have applied if the changed coverage had been the previous coverage.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notification by Secretary of the Treasury to Secretary of Labor of issuance of a preliminary notice of intent to disqualify or of commencement of proceedings to determine satisfaction of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the provisions of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 with respect to whether a plan or a trust meets the requirements of section 410(a) or 411 of title 26 (relating to minimum participation standards and minimum vesting standards, respectively), the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the Secretary of Labor when the Secretary of the Treasury issues a preliminary notice of intent to disqualify related to the plan or trust or, if earlier, at the time of commencing any proceeding to determine whether the plan or trust satisfies such requirements. Unless the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the collection of a tax imposed under title 26 is in jeopardy, the Secretary of the Treasury shall not issue a determination that the plan or trust does not satisfy the requirements of such section until the expiration of a period of 60 days after the date on which he notifies the Secretary of Labor of such review. The Secretary of the Treasury, in his discretion, may extend the 60-day period referred to in the preceding sentence if he determines that such an extension would enable the Secretary of Labor to obtain compliance with such requirements by the plan within the extension period. Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, the Secretary of Labor shall not generally apply part 2 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter to any plan or trust subject to sections 410(a) and 411 of title 26, but shall refer alleged general violations of the vesting or participation standards to the Secretary of the Treasury. (The preceding sentence shall not apply to matters relating to individuals benefits.)</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification to Secretary of Labor before Secretary of the Treasury sends notice of deficiency under section 4971 of title 26; waiver of imposition of tax; requests for investigation; consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the collection of a tax is in jeopardy, in carrying out the provisions of section 4971 of title 26 (relating to taxes on the failure to meet minimum funding standards), the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the Secretary of Labor before sending a notice of deficiency with respect to any tax imposed under that section on an employer, and, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of that section, afford the Secretary of Labor an opportunity to comment on the imposition of the tax in the case. The Secretary of the Treasury may waive the imposition of the tax imposed under section 4971(b) of title 26 in appropriate cases. Upon receiving a written request from the Secretary of Labor or from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the Secretary of the Treasury shall cause an investigation to be commenced expeditiously with respect to whether the tax imposed under section 4971 of title 26 should be applied with respect to any employer to which the request relates. The Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Labor shall consult with each other from time to time with respect to the provisions of section 412 of title 26 (relating to minimum funding standards) and with respect to the funding standards applicable under subchapter I of this chapter in order to coordinate the rules applicable under such standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extended application of regulations prescribed by Secretary of the Treasury relating to minimum participation standards, minimum vesting standards, and minimum funding standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under sections 410(a), 411, and 412 of title 26 (relating to minimum participation standards, minimum vesting standards, and minimum funding standards, respectively) shall also apply to the minimum participation, vesting, and funding standards set forth in parts 2 and 3 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this chapter, the Secretary of Labor shall not prescribe other regulations under such parts, or apply the regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury under sections 410(a), 411, 412 of title 26 and applicable to the minimum participation, vesting, and funding standards under such parts in a manner inconsistent with the way such regulations apply under sections 410(a), 411, and 412 of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Opportunity afforded Secretary of the Treasury to intervene in cases involving construction or application of minimum standards; review of briefs filed by Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or Secretary of Labor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Labor and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, before filing briefs in <!-- PDFPage:506 -->any case involving the construction or application of minimum participation standards, minimum vesting standards, or minimum funding standards under subchapter I of this chapter shall afford the Secretary of the Treasury a reasonable opportunity to review any such brief. The Secretary of the Treasury shall have the right to intervene in any such case.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consultative requirements respecting promulgation of proposed or final regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall consult with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with respect to any proposed or final regulation authorized by subpart C of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26, or by sections 1421 through 1426 of this title, before publishing any such proposed or final regulation.</p>

The Secretary of Labor is authorized, to the extent provided by law, to obtain the services of private research institutions and such other persons by contract or other arrangement as he determines necessary in carrying out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the course of conducting the study and investigation described in subsection (a) of this <!-- PDFPage:509 -->section, and in developing the regulations referred to in subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary of Labor shall consult&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with appropriate professional societies, business organizations, and labor organizations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with the heads of interested Federal departments and agencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after the date on which he submits his report to the Congress under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary of Labor shall, if he determines it to be feasible, develop regulations, which will provide the protection of pension and retirement rights and benefits referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Congressional review of regulations; resolution of disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any regulations developed pursuant to subsection (c) of this section shall take effect if, and only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) before the close of the 120&ndash;day period which begins on the day on which the copies of such regulations are delivered to the House of Representatives and to the Senate, neither the House of Representatives nor the Senate adopts, by an affirmative vote of a majority of those present and voting in that House, a resolution of disapproval.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;resolution of disapproval&rdquo; means only a resolution of either House of Congress, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &ldquo;That the &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; does not favor the taking effect of the regulations transmitted to the Congress by the Secretary of Labor on &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&rdquo;, the first blank space therein being filled with the name of the resolving House and the second blank space therein being filled with the day and year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A motion to discharge may be made only by an individual favoring the resolution, is highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution of disapproval), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed, nor may another motion to discharge the committee be made with respect to any other resolution of disapproval.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) When the committee has reported, or has been discharged from further consideration of, a resolution of disapproval, it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Debate on the resolution of disapproval shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Motions to postpone, made with respect to the discharge from committee or the consideration of a resolution of disapproval, and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business, shall be decided without debate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the House of Representatives or the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to any resolution of disapproval shall be decided without debate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Whenever the Secretary of Labor transmits copies of the regulations to the Congress, a copy of such regulations shall be delivered to each House of Congress on the same day and shall be delivered to the Clerk of the House of Representatives if the House is not in session and to the Secretary of the Senate if the Senate is not in session.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The 120 day period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed by excluding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the days on which either House is not in session because of an adjournment of more than 3 days to a day certain or an adjournment of the Congress sine die, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any Saturday and Sunday, not excluded under subparagraph (A), when either House is not in session.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(9) This subsection is enacted by the Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of resolutions of disapproval described in paragraph (2); and they supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedures of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of that House.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Schedules for premium rates and bases for application; establishment, coverage, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation shall prescribe such schedules of premium rates and bases for the application of those rates as may be necessary to provide sufficient revenue to the fund for the corporation to carry out its functions under this subchapter. The premium rates charged by the corporation for any period shall be uniform for all plans, other than multiemployer plans, insured by the corporation with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322 of this title, and shall be uniform for all multiemployer plans with respect to basic benefits guaranteed by it under section 1322a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation shall maintain separate schedules of premium rates, and bases for the application of those rates, for&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:522 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The corporation may prescribe by regulation the extent to which the rate described in subparagraph (A)(i) applies more than once for any plan year to an individual participating in more than one plan maintained by the same employer, and the corporation may prescribe regulations under which the rate described in clause (iii) or (iv) of subparagraph (A) will not apply to the same participant in any multiemployer plan more than once for any plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the board of directors of the corporation determines that an increase in the premium rates under subparagraph (A) is necessary to provide assistance to plans which are receiving assistance under section 1431 of this title and to plans the board finds are reasonably likely to require such assistance, the board may order such increase in the premium rates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The maximum annual premium rate which may be established under this subparagraph is $2.60 for each participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply if the annual premium rate is increased to a level in excess of $2.60 per participant under any other provisions of this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The board of directors shall review the hearing record established under clause (i) and shall, not later than 30 days before the date on which the increase is to become effective, determine (after consideration of the comments received) whether the amount of the increase should be changed and shall publish its determination in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For purposes of clause (ii), the term &ldquo;unfunded vested benefits&rdquo; means, for a plan year, the excess (if any) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the funding target of the plan as determined under section 1083(d) of this title for the plan year by only taking into account vested benefits and by using the interest rate described in clause (iv), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the fair market value of plan assets for the plan year which are held by the plan on the valuation date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The interest rate used in valuing benefits for purposes of subclause (I) of clause (iii) shall be equal to the first, second, or third segment rate for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins, which would be determined under section 1083(h)(2)(C) of this title if section 1083(h)(2)(D) of this title were applied by using the monthly yields for the month preceding the month in which the plan year begins on investment grade corporate bonds with varying maturities and in the top 3 quality levels rather than the average of such yields for a 24-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) For each plan year beginning in a calendar year after 2006, there shall be substituted for the premium rate specified in clause (i) of subparagraph (A) an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), whether an employer has 25 or fewer employees on the first day of the plan year is determined by taking into consideration all of the employees of all members of the contributing sponsor's controlled group.

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to place a revised schedule (other than a schedule described in subsection (a)(2)(C), (D), or (E) of this section) in effect, the corporation shall transmit the proposed schedule, its proposed effective date, and the reasons for its proposal to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives, and to the Committee on Finance and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The succeeding paragraphs of this subsection are enacted by Congress as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and the House of Representatives, respectively, and as such they shall be deemed a part of the rules of each House, respectively, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in that House in the case of resolutions described in paragraph (3). They shall supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith. They are enacted with full recognition of the constitutional right of either House to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any rule of that House.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of the succeeding paragraphs of this subsection, &ldquo;resolution&rdquo; means only a joint resolution, the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: &ldquo;The proposed revised schedule transmitted to Congress by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation on &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; is hereby approved.&rdquo;, the blank space therein being filled with the date on which the corporation's message proposing the rate was delivered.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) If a committee to which has been referred a resolution has not reported it before the expiration of 10 calendar days after its introduction, it shall then (but not before) be in order to move to discharge the committee from further consideration of that resolution, or to discharge the committee from further consideration of any other resolution with respect to the proposed adjustment which has been referred to the committee. The motion to discharge may be made only by a person favoring the resolution, shall be highly privileged (except that it may not be made after the committee has reported a resolution with respect to the same proposed rate), and debate thereon shall be limited to not more than 1 hour, to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. If the motion to discharge is agreed to or disagreed to, the motion may not be renewed, nor may another motion to discharge the committee be made with respect to any other resolution with respect to the same proposed rate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) When a committee has reported, or has been discharged from further consideration of a resolution, it is at any time thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration of the resolution. The motion is highly privileged and is not debatable. An amendment to the motion is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to. Debate on the resolution shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the resolution. A motion further to limit debate is not debatable. An amendment to, or motion to recommit, the resolution is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the resolution is agreed to or disagreed to.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Motions to postpone, made with respect to the discharge from committee, or the consideration of, a resolution and motions to proceed to the consideration of other business shall be decided without debate. Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a resolution shall be decided without debate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1307. Payment of premiums</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Premiums payable when due; accrual; waiver or reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The designated payor of each plan shall pay the premiums imposed by the corporation under this subchapter with respect to that plan when they are due. Premiums under this subchapter are payable at the time, and on an estimated, <!-- PDFPage:528 -->advance, or other basis, as determined by the corporation. Premiums imposed by this subchapter on September 2, 1974 (applicable to that portion of any plan year during which such date occurs) are due within 30 days after such date. Premiums imposed by this subchapter on the first plan year commencing after September 2, 1974, are due within 30 days after such plan year commences. Premiums shall continue to accrue until a plan's assets are distributed pursuant to a termination procedure, or until a trustee is appointed pursuant to section 1342 of this title, whichever is earlier. The corporation may waive or reduce premiums for a multiemployer plan for any plan year during which such plan receives financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title, except that any amount so waived or reduced shall be treated as financial assistance under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Late payment charge; waiver; interest on overpayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If any basic benefit premium is not paid when it is due the corporation is authorized to assess a late payment charge of not more than 100 percent of the premium payment which was not timely paid. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any payment of premium made within 60 days after the date on which payment is due, if before such date, the designated payor obtains a waiver from the corporation based upon a showing of substantial hardship arising from the timely payment of the premium. The corporation is authorized to grant a waiver under this subsection upon application made by the designated payor, but the corporation may not grant a waiver if it appears that the designated payor will be unable to pay the premium within 60 days after the date on which it is due. If any premium is not paid by the last date prescribed for a payment, interest on the amount of such premium at the rate imposed under section 6601(a) of title 26 (relating to interest on underpayment, nonpayment, or extensions of time for payment of tax) shall be paid for the period from such last date to the date paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation is authorized to pay, subject to regulations prescribed by the corporation, interest on the amount of any overpayment of premium refunded to a designated payor. Interest under this paragraph shall be calculated at the same rate and in the same manner as interest is calculated for underpayments under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Civil action to recover premium penalty and interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any designated payor fails to pay a premium when due, the corporation is authorized to bring a civil action in any district court of the United States within the jurisdiction of which the plan assets are located, the plan is administered, or in which a defendant resides or is found for the recovery of the amount of the premium penalty, and interest, and process may be served in any other district. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction over actions brought under this subsection by the corporation without regard to the amount in controversy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Basic benefits guarantee not stopped by designated payor's failure to pay premiums when due</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation shall not cease to guarantee basic benefits on account of the failure of a designated payor to pay any premium when due.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Designated payor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;designated payor&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the contributing sponsor or plan administrator in the case of a single-employer plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan administrator in the case of a multiemployer plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the contributing sponsor of any single-employer plan is a member of a controlled group, each member of such group shall be jointly and severally liable for any premiums required to be paid by such contributing sponsor. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (<em>o</em>) of section 414 of title 26.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nonforfeitable benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the limitations contained in subsection (b) of this section, the corporation shall guarantee, in accordance with this section, the payment of all nonforfeitable benefits (other than benefits becoming nonforfeitable solely on account of the termination of a plan) under a single-employer plan which terminates at a time when this subchapter applies to it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except to the extent provided in paragraph (7)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) no benefits provided by a plan which has been in effect for less than 60 months at the time the plan terminates shall be guaranteed under this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any increase in the amount of benefits under a plan resulting from a plan amendment which was made, or became effective, whichever is later, within 60 months before the date on which the plan terminates shall be disregarded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the time a successor plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) has been in effect includes the time a previously established plan (within the meaning of section 1321(a) of this title) was in effect. For purposes of determining what benefits are guaranteed under this section in the case of a plan to which section 1321 of this title does not apply on September 3, 1974, the 60-month period referred to in paragraph (1) shall be computed beginning on the first date on which such section does apply to the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of monthly benefits described in subsection (a) of this section provided by a plan, which are guaranteed under this section with respect to a participant, shall not have an actuarial value which exceeds the actuarial value of a monthly benefit in the form of a life annuity commencing at age 65 equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) his average monthly gross income from his employer during the 5 consecutive calendar year period (or, if less, during the number of calendar years in such period in which he actively participates in the plan) during which his gross income from that employer was greater than during any other such period with that employer determined by dividing 1/12 of the sum of all such gross income by the <!-- PDFPage:533 -->number of such calendar years in which he had such gross income, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $750 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the contribution and benefit base (determined under section 230 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 430]) in effect at the time the plan terminates and the denominator of which is such contribution and benefit base in effect in calendar year 1974.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The provisions of this paragraph do not apply to non-basic benefits. The maximum guaranteed monthly benefit shall not be reduced solely on account of the age of a participant in the case of a benefit payable by reason of disability that occurred on or before the termination date, if the participant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that the Social Security Administration has determined that the participant satisfies the definition of disability under title II or XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.; 1381 et seq.], and the regulations thereunder. If a benefit payable by reason of disability is converted to an early or normal retirement benefit for reasons other than a change in the health of the participant, such early or normal retirement benefit shall be treated as a continuation of the benefit payable by reason of disability and this subparagraph shall continue to apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The actuarial value of a benefit, for purposes of this subsection, shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of paragraph (3)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; means &ldquo;earned income&rdquo; within the meaning of section 911(b) of title 26 (determined without regard to any community property laws),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a participant in a plan under which contributions are made by more than one employer, amounts received as gross income from any employer under that plan shall be aggregated with amounts received from any other employer under that plan during the same period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) any non-basic benefit shall be disregarded.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;majority owner&rdquo; means an individual who, at any time during the 60-month period ending on the date the determination is being made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) owns the entire interest in an unincorporated trade or business,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a partnership, is a partner who owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more of either the capital interest or the profits interest in such partnership, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) in the case of a corporation, owns, directly or indirectly, 50 percent or more in value of either the voting stock of that corporation or all the stock of that corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of clause (iii), the constructive ownership rules of section 1563(e) of title 26 (other than paragraph (3)(C) thereof) shall apply, including the application of such rules under section 414(c) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a participant who is a majority owner, the amount of benefits guaranteed under this section shall equal the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a fraction (not to exceed 1) the numerator of which is the number of years from the later of the effective date or the adoption date of the plan to the termination date, and the denominator of which is 10, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount of benefits that would be guaranteed under this section if the participant were not a majority owner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rules governing single-employer plan terminations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exclusive means of plan termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of a termination for which proceedings are otherwise instituted by the corporation as provided in section 1342 of this title, a single-employer plan may be terminated only in a standard termination under subsection (b) of this section or a distress termination under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 60-day notice of intent to terminate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not less than 60 days before the proposed termination date of a standard termination under subsection (b) of this section or a distress termination under subsection (c) of this section, the plan administrator shall provide to each affected party (other than the corporation in the case of a standard termination) a written notice of intent to terminate stating that such termination is intended and the proposed termination date. The written notice shall include any related additional information required in regulations of the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adherence to collective bargaining agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The corporation shall not proceed with a termination of a plan under this section if the termination would violate the terms and conditions of an existing collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the authority of the corporation to institute proceedings to involuntarily terminate a plan under section 1342 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standard termination of single-employer plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General requirements</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:541 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice from the corporation of noncompliance</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Within 60 days after receipt of the notice under subparagraph (A), the corporation shall issue a notice of noncompliance to the plan administrator if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it determines, based on the notice sent under paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (b) of this section, that there is reason to believe that the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) it determines that any other requirement of subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph or of subsection (a)(2) of this section has not been met, unless it further determines that the issuance of such notice would be inconsistent with the interests of participants and beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The corporation and the plan administrator may agree to extend the 60-day period referred to in clause (i) by a written agreement signed by the corporation and the plan administrator before the expiration of the 60-day period. The 60-day period shall be extended as provided in the agreement and may be further extended by subsequent written agreements signed by the corporation and the plan administrator made before the expiration of a previously agreed upon extension of the 60-day period. Any extension may be made upon such terms and conditions (including the payment of benefits) as are agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Final distribution of assets in absence of notice of noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The plan administrator shall commence the final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan as soon as practicable after the expiration of the 60-day (or extended) period referred to in subparagraph (C), but such final distribution may occur only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the plan administrator has not received during such period a notice of noncompliance from the corporation under subparagraph (C), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) when such final distribution occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Methods of final distribution of assets</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In connection with any final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall distribute the assets in accordance with section 1344 of this title.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) purchase irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan. A transfer of assets to the corporation in accordance with section 1350 of this title on behalf of a missing participant shall satisfy this subparagraph with respect to such participant.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification to the corporation of final distribution of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 30 days after the final distribution of assets is completed pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation certifying that the assets of the plan have been distributed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) so as to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Continuing authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the continued exercise by the corporation, after the termination date of a plan terminated in a standard termination under this subsection, of its authority under section 1303 of this title with respect to matters relating to the termination. A certification under paragraph (3)(B) shall not affect the corporation's obligations under section 1322 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to any transaction or series of transactions unless&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Termination of a multiemployer plan under this section occurs as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the adoption after September 26, 1980, of a plan amendment which provides that participants will receive no credit for any purpose under the plan for service with any employer after the date specified by such amendment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, within the meaning of section 1383 of this title, or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the adoption of an amendment to the plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Date of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section is the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the amendment is adopted, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the amendment takes effect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section is the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the last employer withdraws, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day of the first plan year for which no employer contributions were required under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duties of plan sponsor of amended plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (f)(1) of this section, the plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) limit the payment of benefits to benefits which are nonforfeitable under the plan as of the date of the termination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity, unless the plan assets are distributed in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Duties of plan sponsor of nonoperative plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall reduce benefits and suspend benefit payments in accordance with section 1441 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of contribution of employer under amended plan for each plan year subsequent to plan termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a plan which terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section, the rate of an employer's contributions under the plan for each plan year beginning on or after the plan termination date shall equal or exceed the highest rate of employer contributions at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan in the 5 preceding plan years ending on or before the plan termination date, unless the corporation approves a reduction in the rate based on a finding that the plan is or soon will be fully funded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of benefits; reporting requirements for terminated plans and rules and standards for administration of such plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a terminated plan may authorize the payment other than in the form of an annuity of a participant's entire nonforfeitable benefit attributable to employer contributions, other than a death benefit, if the value of the entire nonforfeitable benefit does not exceed $1,750. The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation's risk of loss with respect to the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to prevent unreasonable loss to the corporation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under section 412 of title 26, or has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that a notice of deficiency under section 6212 of title 26 has been mailed with respect to the tax imposed under section 4971(a) of title 26,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the reportable event described in section 1343(c)(7) of this title has occurred, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and bene<!-- PDFPage:550 -->ficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c) of this section). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointment of trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) of this section to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) of this section ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which section 1341a(d) of this title applies, unless such appointment would be adverse to the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries in the aggregate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjudication that plan must be terminated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Order of priority of participants and beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of the termination of a single-employer plan, the plan administrator shall allocate the assets of the plan (available to provide benefits) among the participants and beneficiaries of the plan in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) First, to that portion of each individual's accrued benefit which is derived from the participant's contributions to the plan which were not mandatory contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Second, to that portion of each individual's accrued benefit which is derived from the participant's mandatory contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Third, in the case of benefits payable as an annuity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of the benefit of a participant or beneficiary which was in pay status as of the beginning of the 3-year period ending on the termination date of the plan, to each such benefit, based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a participant's or beneficiary's benefit (other than a benefit described in subparagraph (A)) which would have been in pay status as of the beginning of such 3-year period if the participant had retired prior to the beginning of the 3-year period and if his benefits had commenced (in the normal form of annuity under the plan) as of the beginning of such period, to each such benefit based on the provisions of the plan (as in effect during the 5-year period ending on such date) under which such benefit would be the least.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the lowest benefit in pay status during a 3-year period shall be considered the benefit in pay status for such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Fourth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to all other benefits (if any) of individuals under the plan guaranteed under this subchapter (determined without regard to section 1322b(a) of this title), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to the additional benefits (if any) which would be determined under subparagraph (A) if section 1322(b)(5)(B) of this title did not apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, section 1321 of this title shall be applied without regard to subsection (c) thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Fifth, to all other nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Sixth, to all other benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment of allocations; reallocations; mandatory contributions; establishment of subclasses and categories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The amount allocated under any paragraph of subsection (a) of this section with respect to any benefit shall be properly adjusted for any allocation of assets with respect to that benefit under a prior paragraph of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the assets available for allocation under any paragraph of subsection (a) of this section (other than paragraphs (4), (5), and (6)) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals which are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among such individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If assets available for allocation under paragraph (4) of subsection (a) are insufficient <!-- PDFPage:556 -->to satisfy in full the benefits of all individuals who are described in that paragraph, the assets shall be allocated first to benefits described in subparagraph (A) of that paragraph. Any remaining assets shall then be allocated to benefits described in subparagraph (B) of that paragraph. If assets allocated to such subparagraph (B) are insufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in that subparagraph, the assets shall be allocated pro rata among individuals on the basis of the present value (as of the termination date) of their respective benefits described in that subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) If this paragraph applies, except as provided in subparagraph (B), the assets shall be allocated to the benefits of individuals described in such paragraph (5) on the basis of the benefits of individuals which would have been described in such paragraph (5) under the plan as in effect at the beginning of the 5-year period ending on the date of plan termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allocated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the allocation made pursuant to this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) of title 26 then, if required to prevent the disqualification of the plan (or any trust under the plan) under section 401(a) or 403(a) of title 26, the assets allocated under subsections (a)(4)(B), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section shall be reallocated to the extent necessary to avoid such discrimination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The term &ldquo;mandatory contributions&rdquo; means amounts contributed to the plan by a participant which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions. For this purpose, the total amount of mandatory contributions of a participant is the amount of such contributions reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts paid or distributed to him under the plan before its termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) A plan may establish subclasses and categories within the classes described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (a) of this section in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increase or decrease in value of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring during the period beginning on the later of (1) the date a trustee is appointed under section 1342(b) of this title or (2) the date on which the plan is terminated is to be allocated between the plan and the corporation in the manner determined by the court (in the case of a court-appointed trustee) or as agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator in any other case. Any increase or decrease in the value of the assets of a single-employer plan occurring after the date on which the plan is terminated shall be credited to, or suffered by, the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Distribution of residual assets; restrictions on reversions pursuant to recently amended plans; assets attributable to employee contributions; calculation of remaining assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (3), any residual assets of a single-employer plan may be distributed to the employer if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all liabilities of the plan to participants and their beneficiaries have been satisfied,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the plan provides for such a distribution in these circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In determining the extent to which a plan provides for the distribution of plan assets to the employer for purposes of paragraph (1)(C), any such provision, and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer, shall not be treated as effective before the end of the fifth calendar year following the date of the adoption of such provision or amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction described in section 1058 of this title occurs, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply separately with respect to the amount of any assets transferred in such transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;employer&rdquo; includes any member of the controlled group of which the employer is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m) or (<em>o</em>) of section 414 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before any distribution from a plan pursuant to paragraph (1), if any assets of the plan attributable to employee contributions remain after satisfaction of all liabilities described in subsection (a) of this section, such remaining assets shall be equitably distributed to the participants who made such contributions or their beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the portion of the remaining assets which are attrib<!-- PDFPage:557 -->utable to employee contributions shall be an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the market value of the total remaining assets, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the present value of all portions of the accrued benefits with respect to participants which are derived from participants&rsquo; mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2) of this section), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the present value of all benefits with respect to which assets are allocated under paragraphs (2) through (6) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, each person who is, as of the termination date&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a participant under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an individual who has received, during the 3-year period ending with the termination date, a distribution from the plan of such individual's entire nonforfeitable benefit in the form of a single sum distribution in accordance with section 1053(e) of this title or in the form of irrevocable commitments purchased by the plan from an insurer to provide such nonforfeitable benefit,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be treated as a participant with respect to the termination, if all or part of the nonforfeitable benefit with respect to such person is or was attributable to participants&rsquo; mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the requirements of section 4980(d) of title 26 (as in effect immediately after the enactment of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) or section 1104(d) of this title with respect to any distribution of residual assets of a single-employer plan to the employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Bankruptcy filing substituted for termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a contributing sponsor of a plan has filed or has had filed against such person a petition seeking liquidation or reorganization in a case under title 11 or under any similar Federal law or law of a State or political subdivision, and the case has not been dismissed as of the termination date of the plan, then subsection (a)(3) shall be applied by treating the date such petition was filed as the termination date of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Valuation of section 1362(c) liability for determining amounts payable by corporation to participants and beneficiaries</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a terminated plan, the value of the recovery of liability under section 1362(c) of this title allocable as a plan asset under this section for purposes of determining the amount of benefits payable by the corporation shall be determined by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of liability under section 1362(c) of this title as of the termination date of the plan, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the applicable section 1362(c) recovery ratio.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Section 1362(c) recovery ratio</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the term &ldquo;section 1362(c) recovery ratio&rdquo; means the ratio which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sum of all the amounts of liability under section 1362(c) of this title with respect to such plans as of the termination date in connection with any such prior termination.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Prior terminations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A plan termination described in this subparagraph is a termination with respect to which&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Single-employer plans with two or more contributing sponsors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the plan administrator of a single-employer plan which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall notify the corporation of the withdrawal during a plan year of a substantial employer for such plan year from the plan, within 60 days after such withdrawal, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) request that the corporation determine the liability of all persons with respect to the withdrawal of the substantial employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall, as soon as practicable thereafter, determine whether there is liability resulting from the withdrawal of the substantial employer and notify the liable persons of such liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, any one or more contributing sponsors who withdraw, during a plan year for which they constitute a substantial employer, from a single-employer plan which has two or more contributing sponsors at least two of whom are not under common control, shall, upon notification of such contributing sponsors by the corporation as provided by subsection (a) of this section, be liable, together with the members of their controlled groups, to the corporation in accordance with the provisions of section 1362 of this title and this section. The amount of liability shall be computed on the basis of an amount determined by the corporation to be the amount described in section 1362 of this title for the entire plan, as if the plan had been terminated by the corporation on the date of the withdrawal referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section multiplied by a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the numerator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by such contributing sponsors for the last 5 years ending prior to the withdrawal, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the denominator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by all contributing sponsors for such last 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition to and in lieu of the manner prescribed in the preceding sentence, the corporation may also determine such liability on any other equitable basis prescribed by the corporation in regulations. Any amount collected by the corporation under this subsection shall be held in escrow subject to disposition in accord<!-- PDFPage:566 -->ance with the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Bond in lieu of payment of liability; 5-year termination period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In lieu of payment of a contributing sponsor's liability under this section, the contributing sponsor may be required to furnish a bond to the corporation in an amount not exceeding 150 percent of his liability to insure payment of his liability under this section. The bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury under sections 9304&ndash;9308 of title 31. Any such bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the plan is not terminated under section 1341(c) or 1342 of this title within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the liability is abated and any payment held in escrow shall be refunded without interest (or the bond cancelled) in accordance with bylaws or rules prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the plan terminates under section 1341(c) or 1342 of this title within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the corporation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) demand payment or realize on the bond and hold such amount in escrow for the benefit of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) treat any escrowed payments under this section as if they were plan assets and apply them in a manner consistent with this subtitle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) refund any amount to the contributing sponsor which is not required to meet any obligation of the corporation with respect to the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternate appropriate procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this subsection apply in the case of a withdrawal described in subsection (a) of this section, and the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply, if the corporation determines that the procedure provided for under this subsection is consistent with the purposes of this section and section 1364 of this title and is more appropriate in the particular case. Upon a showing by the plan administrator of the plan that the withdrawal from the plan by one or more contributing sponsors has resulted, or will result, in a significant reduction in the amount of aggregate contributions to or under the plan, the corporation may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require the plan fund to be equitably allocated between those participants no longer working in covered service under the plan as a result of the withdrawal, and those participants who remain in covered service under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) treat that portion of the plan funds allocable under paragraph (1) to participants no longer in covered service as a plan terminated under section 1342 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) treat that portion of the plan fund allocable to participants remaining in covered service as a separate plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Indemnity agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation is authorized to waive the application of the provisions of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section whenever it determines that there is an indemnity agreement in effect among contributing sponsors under the plan which is adequate to satisfy the purposes of this section and of section 1364 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Term of lien</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided under this section, the priority of a lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section shall be determined in the same manner as under section 6323 of title 26 (as in effect on April 7, 1986).

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a case under title 11 or in insolvency proceedings, the lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated in the same manner as a tax due and owing to the United States for purposes of title 11 or section 3713 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of applying section 6323(a) of title 26 to determine the priority between the lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section and a Federal tax lien, each lien shall be treated as a judgment lien arising as of the time notice of such lien is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, notice of the lien imposed by subsection (a) of this section shall be filed in the same manner as under section 6323(f) and (g) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil action; limitation period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, the corporation may bring civil action in a district court of the United States to enforce the lien of the corporation under this section with respect to such liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of the liable person, or in which he has any right, title, or interest to the payment of such liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The liability imposed by section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title may be collected by a proceeding in court if the proceeding is commenced within 6 years after the date upon which the plan was terminated or prior to the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the corporation and the liable person before the expiration of such 6-year period.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Release or subordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation determines that release of the lien or subordination of the lien to any other creditor of the liable person would not adversely affect the collection of the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, or that the amount realizable by the corporation from the property to which the lien attaches will ultimately be increased by such release or subordination, and that the ultimate collection of the liability will be facilitated by such release or subordination, the corporation may issue a certificate of release or subordination of the lien with respect to such property, or any part thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Complete or partial withdrawal not occurring as a result of sale and subsequent cessation of covered operations or cessation of obligation to contribute to covered operations; continuation of liability of seller</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;seller&rdquo;) under this section does not occur solely because, as a result of a bona fide, arm's-length sale of assets to an unrelated party (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;purchaser&rdquo;), the seller ceases covered operations or ceases to have an obligation to contribute for such operations, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the purchaser has an obligation to contribute to the plan with respect to the operations for substantially the same number of contribution base units for which the seller had an obligation to contribute to the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the purchaser provides to the plan for a period of 5 plan years commencing with the first plan year beginning after the sale of assets, a bond issued by a corporate surety company that is an acceptable surety for purposes of section 1112 of this title, or an amount held in escrow by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the plan, in an amount equal to the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the average annual contribution required to be made by the seller with respect to the operations under the plan for the 3 plan years preceding the plan year in which the sale of the employer's assets occurs, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the annual contribution that the seller was required to make with respect to the operations under the plan for the last plan year before the plan year in which the sale of the assets occurs,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">which bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if the purchaser withdraws from the plan, or fails to make a contribution to the plan when due, at any time during the first 5 plan years beginning after the sale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the contract for sale provides that, if the purchaser withdraws in a complete withdrawal, or a partial withdrawal with respect to operations, during such first 5 plan years, the seller is secondarily liable for any withdrawal liability it would have had to the plan with respect to the operations (but for this section) if the liability of the purchaser with respect to the plan is not paid.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the purchaser&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) withdraws before the last day of the fifth plan year beginning after the sale, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) fails to make any withdrawal liability payment when due,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the seller shall pay to the plan an amount equal to the payment that would have been due from the seller but for this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If all, or substantially all, of the seller's assets are distributed, or if the seller is liquidated before the end of the 5 plan year period described in paragraph (1)(C), then the seller shall provide a bond or amount in escrow equal to the present value of the withdrawal liability the seller would have had but for this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If only a portion of the seller's assets are distributed during such period, then a bond or escrow shall be required, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The liability of the party furnishing a bond or escrow under this subsection shall be reduced, upon payment of the bond or escrow to the plan, by the amount thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liability of purchaser</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purposes of this part, the liability of the purchaser shall be determined as if the purchaser had been required to contribute to the plan in the year of the sale and the 4 plan years preceding the sale the amount the seller was required to contribute for such operations for such 5 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the plan is in reorganization in the plan year in which the sale of assets occurs, the purchaser shall furnish a bond or escrow in an amount equal to 200 percent of the amount described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Variances or exemptions from continuation of liability of seller; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may by regulation vary the standards in subparagraphs (B) and (C) of subsection (a)(1) of this section if the variance would more effectively or equitably carry out the purposes of this subchapter. Before it promulgates such regulations, the corporation may grant individual or class variances or exemptions from the requirements of such subparagraphs if the particular case warrants it. Before <!-- PDFPage:576 -->granting such an individual or class variance or exemption, the corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the variance or exemption,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall afford interested persons an opportunity to present their views.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Unrelated party&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;unrelated party&rdquo; means a purchaser or seller who does not bear a relationship to the seller or purchaser, as the case may be, that is described in section 267(b) of title 26, or that is described in regulations prescribed by the corporation applying principles similar to the principles of such section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, there is a partial withdrawal by an employer from a plan on the last day of a plan year if for such plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is a 70-percent contribution decline, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) There is a 70-percent contribution decline for any plan year if during each plan year in the 3-year testing period the employer's contribution base units do not exceed 30 percent of the employer's contribution base units for the high base year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The term &ldquo;3-year testing period&rdquo; means the period consisting of the plan year and the immediately preceding 2 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The number of contribution base units for the high base year is the average number of such units for the 2 plan years for which the employer's contribution base units were the highest within the 5 plan years immediately preceding the beginning of the 3-year testing period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) There is a partial cessation of the employer's contribution obligation for the plan year if, during such year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under one or more but fewer than all collective bargaining agreements under which the employer has been obligated to contribute under the plan but continues to perform work in the jurisdiction of the collective bargaining agreement of the type for which contributions were previously required or transfers such work to another location or to an entity or entities owned or controlled by the employer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an employer permanently ceases to have an obligation to contribute under the plan with respect to work performed at one or more but fewer than all of its facilities, but continues to perform work at the facility of the type for which the obligation to contribute ceased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a cessation of obligations under a collective bargaining agreement shall not be considered to have occurred solely because, with respect to the same plan, one agreement that requires contributions to the plan has been substituted for another agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Retail food industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of a plan in which a majority of the covered employees are employed in the retail food industry, the plan may be amended to provide that this section shall be applied with respect to such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) by substituting &ldquo;35 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;70 percent&rdquo; in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) by substituting &ldquo;65 percent&rdquo; for &ldquo;30 percent&rdquo; in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For any plan year for which the number of contribution base units with respect to which an employer who has partially withdrawn under section 1385(a)(1) of this title has an obligation to contribute under the plan equals or exceeds the number of units for the highest year determined under paragraph (1) without regard to &ldquo;90 percent of&rdquo;, the employer may furnish (in lieu of payment of the partial withdrawal liability determined under section 1386 of this title) a bond to the plan in the amount determined by the plan sponsor (not exceeding 50 percent of the annual payment otherwise required).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the plan sponsor determines under paragraph (1) that the employer has no further liability to the plan for the partial withdrawal, then the bond shall be cancelled.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any conditions; criteria; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The corporation may prescribe regulations providing for the reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any conditions with respect to which the corporation determines that reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Under such regulations, reduction of withdrawal liability shall be provided only with respect to subsequent changes in the employer's contributions for the same operations, or under the same collective bargaining agreement, that gave rise to the partial withdrawal, and changes in the employer's contribution base units with respect to other facilities or other collective bargaining agreements shall not be taken into account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation shall prescribe by regulation a procedure by which a plan may by amendment adopt rules for the reduction or elimination of partial withdrawal liability under any other conditions, subject to the approval of the corporation based on its determination that adoption of such rules by the plan is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amendment of multiemployer plan for determination respecting amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to employer withdrawn from plan; factors determining computation of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A multiemployer plan, other than a plan which primarily covers employees in the build<!-- PDFPage:582 -->ing and construction industry, may be amended to provide that the amount of unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer that withdraws from the plan is an amount determined under paragraph (2), (3), (4), or (5) of this subsection, rather than under subsection (b) or (d) of this section. A plan described in section 1383(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title (relating to the building and construction industry) may be amended, to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the corporation, to provide that the amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to an employer not described in section 1383(b)(1)(A) of this title shall be determined in a manner different from that provided in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to any employer under this paragraph is the sum of the amounts determined under subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount determined under this subparagraph is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the plan's unfunded vested benefits as of the end of the last plan year ending before September 26, 1980, reduced as if those obligations were being fully amortized in level annual installments over 15 years beginning with the first plan year ending on or after such date; multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The method of calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits set forth in subsection (c)(3) of this section shall be the method for calculating an employer's allocable share of unfunded vested benefits under a plan to which section 404(c) of title 26, or a continuation of such a plan, applies, unless the plan is amended to adopt another method authorized under subsection (b) or (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Sections 1384, 1389, 1399(c)(1)(B), and 1405 of this title shall not apply with respect to the withdrawal of an employer from a plan described in paragraph (1) unless the plan is amended to provide that any of such sections apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (D) of this paragraph and in paragraphs (4) and (5), an employer shall pay the amount determined under section 1391 of this title, adjusted if appropriate first under section 1389 of this title and then under section 1386 of this title over the period of years necessary to amortize the amount in level annual payments determined under subparagraph (C), calculated as if the first payment were made on the first day of the plan year following the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs and as if each subsequent payment were made on the first day of each subsequent plan year. Actual payment shall commence in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The determination of the amortization period described in clause (i) shall be based on the assumptions used for the most recent actuarial valuation for the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case in which the amortization period described in subparagraph (A) exceeds 20 years, the employer's liability shall be limited to the first 20 annual payments determined under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Except as provided in subparagraph (E), the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the average annual number of contribution base units for the period of 3 consecutive plan years, during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending before the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs, in which the number of contribution base units for which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan is the highest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the highest contribution rate at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan during the 10 plan years ending with the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of the preceding sentence, a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a)(1) of this title shall be deemed to occur on the last day of the first year of the 3-year testing period described in section 1385(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) A plan may be amended to provide that for any plan year ending before 1986 the amount of each annual payment shall be (in lieu of the amount determined under clause (i)) the average of the required employer contributions under the plan for the period of 3 consecutive plan years (during the period of 10 consecutive plan years ending with the plan year preceding the plan year in which the withdrawal occurs) for which such required contributions were the highest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) Subparagraph (B) shall not apply to any plan year to which this clause applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) This clause shall not apply in the case of any withdrawal described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) If under a plan this clause applies to any plan year but does not apply to the next plan year, this clause shall not apply to any plan year after such next plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(V) For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;required contributions&rdquo; means, for any period, the amounts which the employer was obligated to contribute for such period (not taking into account any delinquent contribution for any other period).</p>

If the plan is so amended, the number &ldquo;5&rdquo; shall be increased by one for each succeeding plan year until the number &ldquo;10&rdquo; is reached.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the liability of each such employer who has withdrawn shall be determined (or redetermined) under this paragraph without regard to subparagraph (B), and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:588 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the total unfunded vested benefits of the plan shall be fully allocated among all such employers in a manner not inconsistent with regulations which shall be prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Withdrawal by an employer from a plan, during a period of 3 consecutive plan years within which substantially all the employers who have an obligation to contribute under the plan withdraw, shall be presumed to be a withdrawal pursuant to an agreement or arrangement, unless the employer proves otherwise by a preponderance of the evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) In the case of a partial withdrawal described in section 1385(a) of this title, the amount of each annual payment shall be the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the amount determined under subparagraph (C) (determined without regard to this subparagraph), multiplied by</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Withdrawal liability shall be payable in accordance with the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor under subsection (b)(1) of this section beginning no later than 60 days after the date of the demand notwithstanding any request for review or appeal of determinations of the amount of such liability or of the schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each annual payment determined under paragraph (1)(C) shall be payable in 4 equal installments due quarterly, or at other intervals specified by plan rules. If a payment is not made when due, interest on the payment shall accrue from the due date until the date on which the payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The employer shall be entitled to prepay the outstanding amount of the unpaid annual withdrawal liability payments determined under paragraph (1)(C), plus accrued interest, if any, in whole or in part, without penalty. If the prepayment is made pursuant to a withdrawal which is later determined to be part of a withdrawal described in paragraph (1)(D), the withdrawal liability of the employer shall not be limited to the amount of the prepayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the event of a default, a plan sponsor may require immediate payment of the outstanding amount of an employer's withdrawal liability, plus accrued interest on the total outstanding liability from the due date of the first payment which was not timely made. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;default&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the failure of an employer to make, when due, any payment under this section, if the failure is not cured within 60 days after the employer receives written notification from the plan sponsor of such failure, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any other event defined in rules adopted by the plan which indicates a substantial likelihood that an employer will be unable to pay its withdrawal liability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Except as provided in paragraph (1)(A)(ii), interest under this subsection shall be charged at rates based on prevailing market rates for comparable obligations, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A multiemployer plan may adopt rules for other terms and conditions for the satisfaction of an employer's withdrawal liability if such rules&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are consistent with this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are not inconsistent with regulations of the corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) In the case of a terminated multiemployer plan, an employer's obligation to make payments under this section ceases at the end of the plan year in which the assets of the plan (exclusive of withdrawal liability claims) are sufficient to meet all obligations of the plan, as determined by the corporation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Arbitration proceedings; matters subject to arbitration, procedures applicable, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any dispute between an employer and the plan sponsor of a multiemployer plan concerning a determination made under sections 1381 through 1399 of this title shall be resolved through arbitration. Either party may initiate the arbitration proceeding within a 60-day period after the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date of notification to the employer under section 1399(b)(2)(B) of this title, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The parties may jointly initiate arbitration within the 180-day period after the date of the plan sponsor's demand under section 1399(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An arbitration proceeding under this section shall be conducted in accordance with fair and equitable procedures to be promulgated by the corporation. The plan sponsor may purchase insurance to cover potential liability of the arbitrator. If the parties have not provided for the costs of the arbitration, including arbitrator's fees, by agreement, the arbitrator shall assess such fees. The arbitrator may also award reasonable attorney's fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For purposes of any proceeding under this section, any determination made by a plan sponsor under sections 1381 through 1399 of this title and section 1405 of this title is presumed correct unless the party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance of the evidence that the determination was unreasonable or clearly erroneous.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of the determination of a plan's unfunded vested benefits for a plan year, the determination is presumed correct unless a party contesting the determination shows by a preponderance of evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the actuarial assumptions and methods used in the determination were, in the aggregate, unreasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the plan's actuary made a significant error in applying the actuarial assumptions or methods.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Alternative collection proceedings; civil action subsequent to arbitration award; conduct of arbitration proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If no arbitration proceeding has been initiated pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the amounts demanded by the plan sponsor under section 1399(b)(1) of this title shall be due and owing on the schedule set forth by the plan sponsor. The plan sponsor may bring an action in a State or Federal court of competent jurisdiction for collection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon completion of the arbitration proceedings in favor of one of the parties, any party thereto may bring an action, no later than 30 days after the issuance of an arbitrator's award, in an appropriate United States district court in accordance with section 1451 of this title to enforce, vacate, or modify the arbitrator's award.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any arbitration proceedings under this section shall, to the extent consistent with this subchapter, be conducted in the same manner, subject to the same limitations, carried out with the same powers (including subpena power), and enforced in United States courts as an arbitration proceeding carried out under title 9.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Presumption respecting finding of fact by arbitrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any proceeding under subsection (b) of this section, there shall be a presumption, rebuttable only by a clear preponderance of the evidence, that the findings of fact made by the arbitrator were correct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments by employer prior and subsequent to determination by arbitrator; adjustments; failure of employer to make payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments shall be made by an employer in accordance with the determinations made under this part until the arbitrator issues a final decision with respect to the determination submitted for arbitration, with any necessary adjustments in subsequent payments for overpayments or underpayments arising out of the decision of the arbitrator with respect to the determination. If the employer fails to make timely payment in accordance with such final decision, the employer shall be treated as being delinquent in the making of a contribution required under the plan (within the meaning of section 1145 of this title).</p>

Such bond or escrow shall remain in effect until there is a final decision in the arbitration proceeding, or in court, of the withdrawal liability dispute, at which time such bond or escrow shall be paid to the plan if such final decision upholds the plan sponsor's determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Definition of small employer</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The term &ldquo;small employer&rdquo; means any employer which, for the calendar year in which the transaction referred to in paragraph (1)(B) occurred and for each of the 3 preceding years, on average&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), a multiemployer plan which transfers liabilities to a single-employer plan shall be liable to the corporation if the single-employer plan terminates within 60 months after the effective date of the transfer.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If, after the receipt of such application, the corporation requests from the plan sponsor additional information necessary for the determination, the running of the 180-day period shall be suspended from the date of such request until the receipt by the corporation of the additional information requested.

This paragraph shall not apply to any application submitted less than 180 days after September 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A multiemployer plan shall not be liable to the corporation as provided in paragraph (1) in the case of a transfer from the multiemployer plan to a single-employer plan of liabilities which accrued under a single-employer plan which merged with the multiemployer plan, if, the value of liabilities transferred to the single-employer plan does not exceed the value of the liabilities for benefits which accrued before the merger, and the value of the assets transferred to the single-employer plan is substantially equal to the value of the assets which would have been in the single-employer plan if the employer had maintained and funded it as a separate plan under which no benefits accrued after the date of the merger.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The corporation may make equitable arrangements with multiemployer plans which are liable under this subsection for satisfaction of their liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantee of benefits under single-employer plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as otherwise determined by the corporation, a transfer of assets or liabilities to a single-employer plan from a plan in reorganization under section 1421 of this title is not effective unless the corporation approves such transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No transfer to which this section applies, in connection with a termination described in section 1341a(a)(2) of this title shall be effective unless the transfer meets such requirements as may be established by the corporation to prevent an increase in the risk of loss to the corporation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to transfer from old plan to new plan pursuant to employee participation in another multiemployer plan after certified change of representative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which an employer has completely or partially withdrawn from a multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;old plan&rdquo;) as a result of a certified change of collective bargaining representative occurring after September 25, 1980, if participants of the old plan who are employed by the employer will, as a result of that change, participate in another multiemployer plan (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;new plan&rdquo;), the old plan shall transfer assets and liabilities to the new plan in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification by employer of plan sponsor of old plan; notification by plan sponsor of old plan of employer and plan sponsor of new plan; appeal by new plan to prevent transfer; further proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The employer shall notify the plan sponsor of the old plan of a change in multiemployer plan participation described in subsection (a) of this section no later than 30 days after the employer determines that the change will occur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan sponsor of the old plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the employer of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the withdrawal,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the old plan's intent to transfer to the new plan the nonforfeitable benefits of the employees who are no longer working in covered service under the old plan as a result of the change of bargaining representative, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the amount of assets and liabilities which are to be transferred to the new plan, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notify the plan sponsor of the new plan of the benefits, assets, and liabilities which will be transferred to the new plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(B), the new plan may file an appeal with the corporation to prevent the transfer. The transfer shall not be made if the corporation determines that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer. Upon notification described in paragraph (2), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer fails to object to the transfer within 60 days after receipt of the notice described in paragraph (2)(A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the new plan either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) fails to file such an appeal, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the corporation, pursuant to such an appeal, fails to find that the new plan would suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer described in the notice under paragraph (2)(B) within 180 days after the date on which the appeal is filed,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities to the new plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduction of amount of withdrawal liability of employer upon transfer of appropriate amount of assets and liabilities by plan sponsor of old plan to new plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the plan sponsor of the old plan transfers the appropriate amount of assets and liabilities under this section to the new plan, then the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability (as determined under section 1381(b) of this title without regard to such transfer and this section) with respect to the old plan shall be reduced by the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:597 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the value of the unfunded vested benefits allocable to the employer which were transferred by the plan sponsor of the old plan to the new plan, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the value of the assets transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Escrow payments by employer upon complete or partial withdrawal and prior to transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which there is a complete or partial withdrawal described in subsection (a) of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the new plan files an appeal with the corporation under subsection (b)(3) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the employer is required by section 1399 of this title to begin making payments of withdrawal liability before the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the date on which the corporation finds that the new plan would not suffer substantial financial harm as a result of the transfer, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the employer shall make such payments into an escrow held by a bank or similar financial institution satisfactory to the old plan. If the transfer is made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be returned to the employer. If the transfer is not made, the amounts paid into the escrow shall be paid to the old plan and credited against the employer's withdrawal liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition on transfer of assets to new plan by plan sponsor of old plan; exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (b) of this section, the plan sponsor shall not transfer any assets to the new plan if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the old plan is in reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the transfer of assets would cause the old plan to go into reorganization (within the meaning of section 1421(a) of this title).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which a transfer of assets from the old plan to the new plan is prohibited by paragraph (1), the plan sponsor of the old plan shall transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all nonforfeitable benefits described in subsection (b)(2) of this section, if the value of such benefits does not exceed the withdrawal liability of the employer with respect to such withdrawal, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such nonforfeitable benefits having a value equal to the withdrawal liability of the employer, if the value of such benefits exceeds the withdrawal liability of the employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agreement between plan sponsors of old plan and new plan to transfer in compliance with other statutory provisions; reduction of withdrawal liability of employer from old plan; amount of withdrawal liability of employer to new plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (b) and (e) of this section, the plan sponsors of the old plan and the new plan may agree to a transfer of assets and liabilities that complies with sections 1411 and 1414 of this title, rather than this section, except that the employer's liability with respect to the withdrawal from the old plan shall be reduced under subsection (c) of this section as if assets and liabilities had been transferred in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the employer withdraws from the new plan within 240 months after the effective date of a transfer of assets and liabilities described in this section, the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the new plan shall be the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employer's withdrawal liability determined under part 1 of this subtitle with respect to the new plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount by which the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan was reduced under subsection (c) of this section, reduced by 5 percent for each 12-month period following the effective date of the transfer and ending before the date of the withdrawal from the new plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;appropriate amount of assets&rdquo; means the amount by which the value of the nonforfeitable benefits to be transferred exceeds the amount of the employer's withdrawal liability to the old plan (determined under part 1 of this subtitle without regard to section 1391(e) of this title), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the increase in normal cost for a plan year determined under the entry age normal funding method due to increases in benefits described in section 1421(b)(4)(A)(ii) of this title (determined without regard to section 1421(b)(4)(B)(i) of this title), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments the increase in the value of vested benefits under the plan due to increases in benefits described in clause (i) over&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) 10 years, to the extent such increase in value is attributable to persons in pay status, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:601 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) 25 years, to the extent such increase in value is attributable to other participants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the funding standard requirement for any plan year is an amount equal to the net charge to the funding standard account for such plan year (as defined in section 1421(b)(2) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a plan described in section 1396(b) of this title, if a plan amendment which increases benefits is adopted after January 1, 1980&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) paragraph (1) shall apply only if the plan is a plan described in subparagraph (B), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount under paragraph (1) shall be determined without regard to paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan is described in this subparagraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the rate of employer contributions under the plan for the first plan year beginning on or after the date on which an amendment increasing benefits is adopted, multiplied by the valuation contribution base for that plan year, equals or exceeds the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the amount that would be necessary to amortize fully, in equal annual installments, by July 1, 1986, the unfunded vested benefits attributable to plan provisions in effect on July 1, 1977 (determined as of the last day of the base plan year); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the amount that would be necessary to amortize fully, in equal annual installments, over the period described in subparagraph (C), beginning with the first day of the first plan year beginning on or after the date on which the amendment is adopted, the unfunded vested benefits (determined as of the last day of the base plan year) attributable to each plan amendment after July 1, 1977; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the rate for the plan year immediately preceding such subsequent plan year, plus 5 percent of such rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Adjustment of vested benefits charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the minimum contribution requirement with respect to a plan for a plan year under subsection (b) of this section, the vested benefits charge may be adjusted to reflect a plan amendment reducing benefits under section 412(c)(8)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1423_1_target" name="1423_1">1</a></sup> of title 26.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1424. Overburden credit against minimum contribution requirement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of overburden credit to determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the minimum contribution requirement under section 1423 of this title (before the application of section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title) the plan sponsor of a plan which is overburdened for the plan year shall apply an overburden credit against the plan's minimum contribution requirement for the plan year (determined without regard to section 1423(b)(2) or (d) of this title and without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of overburden status of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan is overburdened for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants under the plan in the base plan year exceeds the average of the number of active participants in the base plan year and the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rate of employer contributions under the plan equals or exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such rate for the preceding plan year, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such rate for the plan year preceding the first year in which the plan is in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of overburden credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year is the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) one-half of the average guaranteed benefit paid for the base plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the overburden factor for the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of the overburden credit for a plan year shall not exceed the amount of the minimum contribution requirement for such year (determined without regard to this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of overburden factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the overburden factor of a plan for the plan year is an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the average number of pay status participants for the base plan year, reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the average of the number of active participants for the base plan year and for each of the 2 plan years preceding the base plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions; determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;pay status participant&rdquo; means, with respect to a plan, a participant receiving retirement benefits under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The number of active participants for a plan year shall be the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number of active employees who are participants in the plan and on whose behalf contributions are required to be made during the plan year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of active employees who are not participants in the plan but who are in an employment unit covered by a collective bargaining agreement which requires the employees&rsquo; employer to contribute to the plan, unless service in such employment unit was never covered under the plan or a predecessor thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the total number of active employees attributed to employers who made payments to the plan for the plan year of withdrawal liability pursuant to part 1 of this subtitle, determined by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total amount of such payments, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount equal to the total contributions received by the plan during the plan year divided by the average number of active employees who were participants in the plan during the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulation provide alternative methods of determining active participants where (by reason of irregular employment, contributions on a unit basis, or otherwise) this paragraph does not yield a representative basis for determining the credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;average number&rdquo; means, with respect to pay status participants for a plan year, a number equal to one-half the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the number with respect to the plan as of the beginning of the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number with respect to the plan as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The average guaranteed benefit paid is 12 times the average monthly pension payment guaranteed under section 1322a(c)(1) of this title determined under the provisions of the plan in effect at the beginning of the first plan year in which the plan is in reorganization and without regard to section 1322a(c)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1424_1_target" name="1424_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The first year in which the plan is in reorganization is the first of a period of 1 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan has been in reorganization not taking into account any plan years the plan was in reorganization prior to any period of 3 or more consecutive plan years in which the plan was not in reorganization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Eligibility of plan for overburden credit for plan year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a plan is not eligible for an overburden credit for a plan year if the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the plan's current contribution base for the plan year was reduced, without a corresponding reduction in the plan's unfunded vested benefits attributable to pay status participants, as a result of a change in an agreement providing for employer contributions under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a complete or partial withdrawal of an employer (within the meaning of part 1 of this subtitle) does not impair a plan's eligibility for an overburden credit, unless the Secretary of the Treasury finds that a contribution base reduction described in paragraph (1) resulted from a transfer of liabilities to another plan in connection with the withdrawal.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:603 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Overburden credit where 2 or more multiemployer plans merge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if 2 or more multiemployer plans merge, the amount of the overburden credit which may be applied under this section with respect to the plan resulting from the merger for any of the 3 plan years ending after the effective date of the merger shall not exceed the sum of the used overburden credit for each of the merging plans for its last plan year ending before the effective date of the merger. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the used overburden credit is that portion of the credit which does not exceed the excess of the minimum contribution requirement (determined without regard to any overburden requirement under this section) over the employer contributions required under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, a multiemployer plan in reorganization may be amended in accordance with this section, to reduce or eliminate accrued benefits attributable to employer contributions which, under section 1322a(b) of this title, are not eligible for the corporation's guarantee. The preceding sentence shall only apply to accrued benefits under plan amendments (or plans) adopted after March 26, 1980, or under collective bargaining agreements entered into after March 26, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the minimum contribution requirement with respect to a plan for a plan year under section 1423(b) of this title, the vested benefits charge may be adjusted to reflect a plan amendment reducing benefits under this section or section 412(c)(8)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1425_1_target" name="1425_1">1</a></sup> of title 26, but only if the amendment is adopted and effective no later than 2&frac12; months after the end of the plan year, or within such extended period as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation under section 412(c)(10)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1425_1_target" name="1425_1">1</a></sup> of title 26.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) any category of accrued benefits is not reduced with respect to inactive participants to a greater extent proportionally than such category of accrued benefits is reduced with respect to active participants,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) benefits attributable to employer contributions other than accrued benefits and the rate of future benefit accruals are reduced at least to an extent equal to the reduction in accrued benefits of inactive participants, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in any case in which the accrued benefit of a participant or beneficiary is reduced by changing the benefit form or the requirements which the participant or beneficiary must satisfy to be entitled to the benefit, such reduction is not applicable to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) any participant or beneficiary in pay status on the effective date of the amendment, or the beneficiary of such a participant, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) any participant who has attained normal retirement age, or who is within 5 years of attaining normal retirement age, on the effective date of the amendment, or the beneficiary of any such participant; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the rate of employer contributions, calculated without regard to the amendment, for the plan year in which the amendment becomes effective, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the rate of employer contributions for the plan year preceding the plan year in which the amendment becomes effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan sponsors shall include in any notice required to be sent to plan participants and beneficiaries under paragraph (1) information as to the rights and remedies of plan participants and beneficiaries as well as how to contact the Department of Labor for further information and assistance where appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recoupment by plan of excess benefit payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A plan may not recoup a benefit payment which is in excess of the amount payable under the plan because of an amendment retroactively reducing accrued benefits under this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:604 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amendment of plan to increase or restore accrued benefits previously reduced or rate of future benefit accruals; conditions, applicable factors, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A plan which has been amended to reduce accrued benefits under this section may be amended to increase or restore accrued benefits, or the rate of future benefit accruals, only if the plan is amended to restore levels of previously reduced accrued benefits of inactive participants and of participants who are within 5 years of attaining normal retirement age to at least the same extent as any such increase in accrued benefits or in the rate of future benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection, in the case of a plan which has been amended under this section to reduce accrued benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit increase to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an increase in a benefit, or in the rate of future benefit accruals, shall be considered a benefit restoration to the extent that the benefit, or the accrual rate, is not thereby increased above the highest benefit level, or accrual rate, which was in effect under the terms of the plan immediately before the effective date of the amendment reducing accrued benefits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a plan is amended to partially restore previously reduced accrued benefit levels, or the rate of future benefit accruals, the benefits of inactive participants shall be restored in at least the same proportions as other accrued benefits which are restored.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No benefit increase under a plan may take effect in a plan year in which an amendment reducing accrued benefits under the plan, in accordance with this section, is adopted or first becomes effective.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, &ldquo;inactive participant&rdquo; means a person not in covered service under the plan who is in pay status under the plan or who has a nonforfeitable benefit under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Promulgation of rules; contents, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules under which, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, accrued benefit reductions or benefit increases for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in contribution rates and other relevant factors reflecting differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding sections 1053 and 1054 of this title, in any case in which benefit payments under an insolvent multiemployer plan exceed the resource benefit level, any such payments of benefits which are not basic benefits shall be suspended, in accordance with this section, to the extent necessary to reduce the sum of such payments and the payments of such basic benefits to the greater of the resource benefit level or the level of basic benefits, unless an alternative procedure is prescribed by the corporation under section 1322a(g)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of insolvency status for plan year; definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, for a plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a multiemployer plan is insolvent if the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the plan year, or if the plan is determined to be insolvent under subsection (d) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;resource benefit level&rdquo; means the level of monthly benefits determined under subsections (c)(1) and (3) and (d)(3) of this section to be the highest level which can be paid out of the plan's available resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) &ldquo;available resources&rdquo; means the plan's cash, marketable assets, contributions, withdrawal liability payments, and earnings, less reasonable administrative expenses and amounts owed for such plan year to the corporation under section 1431(b)(2) of this title; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination by plan sponsor of plan in reorganization of resource benefit level of plan for each insolvency year; uniform application of suspension of benefits; adjustments of benefit payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing the plan's resource benefit level for each insolvency year, based on the plan sponsor's reasonable projection of the plan's available resources and the benefits payable under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The suspension of benefit payments under this section shall, in accordance with regula<!-- PDFPage:605 -->tions prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, apply in substantially uniform proportions to the benefits of all persons in pay status (within the meaning of section 1421(b)(6) of this title) under the plan, except that the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe rules under which benefit suspensions for different participant groups may be varied equitably to reflect variations in contribution rates and other relevant factors including differences in negotiated levels of financial support for plan benefit obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if a plan sponsor determines in writing a resource benefit level for a plan year which is below the level of basic benefits, the payment of all benefits other than basic benefits must be suspended for that plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) If, by the end of an insolvency year, the plan sponsor determines in writing that the plan's available resources in that insolvency year could have supported benefit payments above the resource benefit level for that insolvency year, the plan sponsor shall distribute the excess resources to the participants and beneficiaries who received benefit payments from the plan in that insolvency year, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;excess resources&rdquo; means available resources above the amount necessary to support the resource benefit level, but no greater than the amount necessary to pay benefits for the plan year at the benefit levels under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, by the end of an insolvency year, any benefit has not been paid at the resource benefit level, amounts up to the resource benefit level which were unpaid shall be distributed to the participants and beneficiaries, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, to the extent possible taking into account the plan's total available resources in that insolvency year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Except as provided in paragraph (4) or (5), a plan is not required to make retroactive benefit payments with respect to that portion of a benefit which was suspended under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applicability and determinations respecting plan assets; time for determinations of resource benefit level and level of basic benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As of the end of the first plan year in which a plan is in reorganization, and at least every 3 plan years thereafter (unless the plan is no longer in reorganization), the plan sponsor shall compare the value of plan assets (determined in accordance with section 1423(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title) for that plan year with the total amount of benefit payments made under the plan for that plan year. Unless the plan sponsor determines that the value of plan assets exceeds 3 times the total amount of benefit payments, the plan sponsor shall determine whether the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years. If the plan sponsor makes such a determination that the plan will be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years, the plan sponsor shall make the comparison under this paragraph at least annually until the plan sponsor makes a determination that the plan will not be insolvent in any of the next 5 plan years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, at any time, the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization reasonably determines, taking into account the plan's recent and anticipated financial experience, that the plan's available resources are not sufficient to pay benefits under the plan when due for the next plan year, the plan sponsor shall make such determination available to interested parties.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall determine in writing for each insolvency year the resource benefit level and the level of basic benefits no later than 3 months before the insolvency year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice, etc., requirements of plan sponsor of plan in reorganization regarding insolvency and resource benefit levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization determines under subsection (d)(1) or (2) of this section that the plan may become insolvent (within the meaning of subsection (b)(1) of this section), the plan sponsor shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the corporation, the parties described in section 1422(a)(2) of this title, and the plan participants and beneficiaries of that determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inform the parties described in section 1422(a)(2) of this title and the plan participants and beneficiaries that if insolvency occurs certain benefit payments will be suspended, but that basic benefits will continue to be paid.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No later than 2 months before the first day of each insolvency year, the plan sponsor of a plan in reorganization shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the corporation, and the parties described in paragraph (1)(B) of the resource benefit level determined in writing for that insolvency year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any case in which the plan sponsor anticipates that the resource benefit level for an insolvency year may not exceed the level of basic benefits, the plan sponsor shall notify the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notice required by this subsection shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation, except that notice to the Secretary of the Treasury shall be given in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The corporation may prescribe a time other than the time prescribed by this section for the making of a determination or the filing of a notice under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Financial assistance from corporation; conditions and criteria applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the plan sponsor of an insolvent plan, for which the resource benefit level is above the level of basic benefits, anticipates that, for any month in an insolvency year, the plan will not have funds sufficient to pay basic benefits, the plan sponsor may apply for financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A plan sponsor who has determined a resource benefit level for an insolvency year which is below the level of basic benefits shall apply for financial assistance from the corporation under section 1431 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which is not a multiemployer plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which terminates after June 30, 1974, and before September 2, 1974,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to which section 1321 of this title would apply if that section were effective beginning on July 1, 1974, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) with respect to which a notice is filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than 10 days after September 2, 1974, except that, for reasonable cause shown, such notice may be filed with the Secretary of Labor and received by him not later than October 31, 1974, stating that the plan is a plan described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a plan described in the preceding sentence unless the corporation finds substantial evidence that the plan was terminated for a reasonable business purpose and not for the purpose of obtaining the payment of benefits by the corporation under this subchapter or for the purpose of avoiding the liability which might be imposed under subtitle D of this subchapter if the plan terminated on or after September 2, 1974. The provisions of subtitle D of this subchapter do not apply in the case of such a plan which terminates before September 2, 1974. For purposes of determining whether a plan is a plan described in paragraph (2), the provisions of section 1348 of this title shall not apply, but the corporation shall make the determination on the basis of the date on which benefits ceased to accrue or on any other reasonable basis consistent with the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the corporation shall not pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan was maintained during the 60 months immediately preceding the date on which the plan terminates, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the corporation determines that the payment by the corporation of benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to that plan will not jeopardize the payments the corporation anticipates it may be required to make in connection with benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to multiemployer plans which terminate after July 31, 1980.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any provision of section 1321 or 1322 of this title which would prevent such payments, the corporation, in carrying out its authority under paragraph (2), may pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan described in paragraph (2) in any case in which those benefits would otherwise not be payable if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan has been in effect for at least 5 years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan has been in substantial compliance with the funding requirements for a qualified plan with respect to the employees and former employees in those employment units on the basis of which the participating employers have contributed to the plan for the preceding 5 years, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the participating employers and employee organization or organizations had no reasonable recourse other than termination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the corporation determines, under paragraph (2) or (3), that it will pay benefits guaranteed under this subchapter with respect to a multiemployer plan which terminates before August 1, 1980, the corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may establish requirements for the continuation of payments which commenced before January 2, 1974, with respect to retired participants under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may not, notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, make payments with respect to any participant under such a plan who, on January 1, 1974, was receiving payment of retirement benefits, in excess of the amounts and rates payable with respect to such participant on that date,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) may not make any payments with respect to benefits guaranteed under this subchapter in connection with such a plan which are derived, directly or indirectly, from amounts borrowed under section 1305(c) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall review from time to time payments made under the authority granted to it by paragraphs (2) and (3), and reduce or terminate such payments to the extent necessary to avoid jeopardizing the ability of the corporation to make payments of benefits guaranteed under this subchapter in connection with multiemployer plans which terminate after July 31, 1980, without increasing premium rates for such plans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, guaranteed benefits payable by the corporation pursuant to its discretionary authority under this section shall continue to be paid at the level guaranteed under section 1322 of this title, without regard to any limitation on payment under subparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection (c)(4) of this section.</p>
