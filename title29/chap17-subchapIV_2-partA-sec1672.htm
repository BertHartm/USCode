<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Monitoring of programs for migrant and seasonal employment</h4>

In awarding any grant or contract for services under this section, the Secretary shall use procedures consistent with standard competitive Government procurement policies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The competition for grants under this section shall be conducted every 2 years, except that if a recipient of such a grant has performed satisfactorily under the terms of the existing grant agreement, the Secretary may waive the requirement for such competition upon receipt from the recipient of a satisfactory 2-year program plan for the succeeding 2-year grant period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Programs and activities supported under this section, including those carried out under other provisions of this chapter, shall enable farmworkers and their dependents to obtain or retain employment, to participate in other program activities leading to their eventual placement in unsubsidized agricultural or nonagricultural employment, and to participate in activities leading to stabilization in agricultural employment, and shall include related assistance and supportive services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Recipients of funds under this section shall establish performance goals, which shall, to the extent required by the Secretary, comply with performance standards established by the Secretary pursuant to section 1516 of this title.</p>
