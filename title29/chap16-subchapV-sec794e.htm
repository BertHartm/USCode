<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) are ineligible for protection and advocacy programs under subtitle C of the Developmental Disabilities Assistance and Bill of Rights Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 15041 et seq.] because the individuals do not have a developmental disability, as defined in section 102 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 15002]; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Construction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from such remainder for each such fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make an allotment to the eligible system within a State of an amount bearing the same ratio to such remainder as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this section, and except as provided in paragraph (4), the allotment to any system under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $100,000 or 1/3 of 1 percent of the remainder for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment to any system under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $100,000 or 1/3 of 1 percent of such remainder shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.</p>
