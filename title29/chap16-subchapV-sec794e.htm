<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to support a system in each State to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with disabilities who&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appropriations less than $5,500,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry out this section is less than $5,500,000, the Commissioner may make grants from such amount to eligible systems within States to plan for, develop outreach strategies for, and carry out protection and advocacy programs authorized under this section for individuals with disabilities who meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appropriations of $5,500,000 or more</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Technical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year in which the amount appropriated to carry out this section equals or exceeds $5,500,000, the Commissioner shall set aside not less than 1.8 percent and not more than 2.2 percent of the amount to provide training and technical assistance to the systems established under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any such fiscal year, after the reservation required by paragraph (1) has been made, the Commissioner shall make allotments from the remainder of such amount in accordance with paragraph (3) to eligible systems within States to enable such systems to carry out protection and advocacy programs authorized under this section for such individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Systems within States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Population basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from such remainder for each such fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make an allotment to the eligible system within a State of an amount bearing the same ratio to such remainder as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this section, and except as provided in paragraph (4), the allotment to any system under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $100,000 or one-third of one percent of the remainder for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment to any system under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $100,000 or one-third of one percent of such remainder shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Adjustment for inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1994, in which the total amount appropriated to carry out this section exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this section for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Commissioner shall increase the minimum allotment under paragraphs (3)(B) and (4)(B) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.</p>
