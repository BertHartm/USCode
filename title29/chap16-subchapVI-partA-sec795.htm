<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to promote useful opportunities in community service activities for individuals with disabilities who have poor employment prospects, the Secretary of Labor (hereinafter in this part referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) is authorized to establish a community service employment pilot program for individuals with disabilities. For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;eligible individuals&rdquo; means persons who are individuals with disabilities (as defined in section 706(8)(A) of this title) and who are referred to programs under this part by designated State units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreements; factors determining eligibility for cost payments; rate of pay; certificate of exemption by Department of Labor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may enter into agreements with public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations, including national organizations, agencies of a State government or a political subdivision of a State (having elected or duly appointed governing officials), or a combination of such political subdivisions, or tribal organizations in order to carry out the pilot program referred to in subsection (a) of this section. Such agreements may include provisions consistent with subsection (c) of this section for the payment of the costs of projects developed by such organizations and agencies in cooperation with the Secretary. No payment shall be made by the Secretary toward the cost of any such project unless the Secretary determines that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Such project will provide employment only for eligible individuals, except that if eligible individuals are not available to serve as technical, administrative, or supervisory personnel for a project then such personnel may be recruited from among other individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such project will provide employment for eligible individuals in the community in which such individuals reside, or in nearby communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Such project will employ eligible individuals in services related to publicly owned and operated facilities and projects, or projects sponsored by organizations, other than political parties, exempt from taxation under section 501(c)(3) of title 26, except for projects involving the construction, operation, or maintenance of any facility used or to be used as a place for sectarian religious instruction or worship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Such project will contribute to the general welfare of the community in which eligible individuals are employed under such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Such project (i) will result in an increase in employment opportunities over those opportunities which would otherwise be available, (ii) will not result in any displacement of currently employed workers (including partial displacement, such as a reduction in the hours of nonovertime work or wages or employment benefits), and (iii) will not impair existing contracts or result in the substitution of Federal funds for other funds in connection with work that would otherwise be performed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Such project will not employ any eligible individual to perform work which is the same or substantially the same as that performed by any other person who is on layoff from employment with the agency or organization sponsoring such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Such project will utilize methods of recruitment and selection (including the listing of job vacancies with the State agency units designated under section 721(a)(2)(A) of this title to administer vocational rehabilitation services under this chapter) which will assure that the maximum number of eligible individuals will have an opportunity to participate in the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Such project will provide for (i) such training as may be necessary to make the most effective use of the skills and talents of individuals who are participating in the project, and (ii) during the period of such training, a reasonable subsistence allowance for such individuals and the payment of any other reasonable expenses related to such training.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) Such project will provide safe and healthy working conditions for any eligible individual employed under such project and will pay any such individual at a rate of pay not lower than the rate of pay described in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) Such project will be established or administered with the advice of (i) persons competent in the field of service in which employment is being provided, and (ii) persons who are knowledgeable with regard to the needs of individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) Such project will pay any reasonable costs for work-related expenses, transportation, and personal assistance services incurred by eligible individuals employed under <!-- PDFPage:296 -->such project in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(L) Such project will provide appropriate placement services for employees under the project to assist them in locating unsubsidized employment when the Federal assistance for the project terminates.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The rate of pay referred to in subparagraph (I) of paragraph (1) is the highest of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#795_1_target" name="795_1">1</a></sup> prevailing rate of pay for persons employed in similar occupations by the same employer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The minimum wage which would be applicable to the employee under the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [29 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] if such employee were not exempt from such Act under section 13 thereof [29 U.S.C. 213].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The State or local minimum wage for the most nearly comparable covered employment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Department of Labor shall not issue any certificate of exemption under section 14(c) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 [29 U.S.C. 214(c)] with respect to any person employed in a project under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cost payments; non-Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may pay not to exceed 90 percent of the cost of any project which is the subject of an agreement entered into under subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Secretary may pay all of the costs of any such project which is (A) an emergency or disaster project, or (B) a project located in an economically depressed area, as determined by the Secretary in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce and the Director of the Community Services Administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The non-Federal share of any project under this part may be in cash or in kind. In determining the amount of the non-Federal share, the Secretary may attribute fair market value to services and facilities contributed from non-Federal sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Method of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments under this part may be made in advance or by way of reimbursement, and in such installments as the Secretary may determine.</p>
