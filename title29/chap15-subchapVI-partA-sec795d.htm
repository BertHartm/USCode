<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Preference; equitable distribution among States; determination of allotment; underserved States; Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Preference in awarding grants or contracts under this part shall be given to organizations of proven ability in providing employment services to individuals with disabilities under this program and similar programs. The Secretary, in awarding grants and contracts under this section, shall, to the extent feasible, assure an equitable distribution of activities under such grants and contracts among the States, taking into account the needs of underserved States and the needs of Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall allot for projects within each State the sums appropriated for any fiscal year under section 795f of this title so that each State will receive an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of the State bears to the population of all the States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount allotted for projects within any State under subsection (a) of this section for any fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required for such year shall be reallotted, from time to time and on such dates during such year as the Secretary may fix, to projects within other States in proportion to the original allotments to projects within such <!-- PDFPage:293 -->States under subsection (a) of this section for such year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates that projects within such State need and will be able to use for such year. The total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount reallotted to a State under this subsection during a year shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Apportionment among areas within each State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount apportioned for projects within each State under subsection (a) of this section shall be apportioned among areas within each such State in an equitable manner, taking into consideration (1) the proportion which eligible individuals in each such area bears to the total number of such individuals, respectively, in that State, and (2) the relative distribution of such individuals residing in rural and urban areas within the State (including individuals residing on Indian reservations).</p>
