<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Additional material required of applicants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before issuing an advance determination of whether a pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan, a trust which is a part of such a plan, or an annuity or bond purchase plan meets the requirements of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26, the Secretary of the Treasury shall require the person applying for the de<!-- PDFPage:454 -->termination to provide, in addition to any material and information necessary for such determination, such other material and information as may reasonably be made available at the time such application is made as the Secretary of Labor may require under subchapter I of this chapter for the administration of that subchapter. The Secretary of the Treasury shall also require that the applicant provide evidence satisfactory to the Secretary that the applicant has notified each employee who qualifies as an interested party (within the meaning of regulations prescribed under section 7476(b)(1) of title 26 (relating to declaratory judgements in connection with the qualification of certain retirement plans)) of the application for a determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Opportunity to comment on application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever an application is made to the Secretary of the Treasury for a determination of whether a pension, profit-sharing, or stock bonus plan, a trust which is a part of such a plan, or an annuity or bond purchase plan meets the requirements of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26, the Secretary shall upon request afford an opportunity to comment on the application at any time within 45 days after receipt thereof to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any employee or class of employee qualifying as an interested party within the meaning of the regulations referred to in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary of Labor, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Labor may not request an opportunity to comment upon such an application unless he has been requested in writing to do so by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or by the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 10 employees, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 10 percent of the employees</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">who qualify as interested parties within the meaning of the regulations referred to in subsection (a) of this section. Upon receiving such a request, the Secretary of Labor shall furnish a copy of the request to the Secretary of the Treasury within 5 days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays (as set forth in section 6103 of title 5)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon receiving such a request from the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of the Treasury shall furnish to the Secretary of Labor such information held by the Secretary of the Treasury relating to the application as the Secretary of Labor may request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Labor shall, within 30 days after receiving a request from the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or from the necessary number of employees who qualify as interested parties, notify the Secretary of the Treasury, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and such employees with respect to whether he is going to comment on the application to which the request relates and with respect to any matters raised in such request on which he is not going to comment. If the Secretary of Labor indicates in the notice required under the preceding sentence that he is not going to comment on all or part of the matters raised in such request, the Secretary of the Treasury shall afford the corporation, and such employees, an opportunity to comment on the application with respect to any matter on which the Secretary of Labor has declined to comment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Intervention by Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation or Secretary of Labor into declaratory judgment action under section 7476 of title 26, action by Corporation authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and, upon petition of a group of employees referred to in subsection (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary of Labor, may intervene in any action brought for declaratory judgment under section 7476 of title 26 in accordance with the provisions of such section. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation is permitted to bring an action under such section 7476 under such rules as may be prescribed by the United States Tax Court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notification and information by Secretary of the Treasury to Secretary of Labor upon issuance by Secretary of the Treasury of a determination letter to applicant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that a plan or trust to which this section applies meets the applicable requirements of part I of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26 and issues a determination letter to the applicant, the Secretary shall notify the Secretary of Labor of his determination and furnish such information and material relating to the application and determination held by the Secretary of the Treasury as the Secretary of Labor may request for the proper administration of subchapter I of this chapter. The Secretary of Labor shall accept the determination of the Secretary of the Treasury as prima facie evidence of initial compliance by the plan with the standards of parts 2, 3, and 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter. The determination of the Secretary of the Treasury shall not be prima facie evidence on issues relating solely to part 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter. If an application for such a determination is withdrawn, or if the Secretary of the Treasury issues a determination that the plan or trust does not meet the requirements of such part I, the Secretary shall notify the Secretary of Labor of the withdrawal or determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section does not apply with respect to an application for any plan received by the Secretary of the Treasury before the date on which section 410 of title 26 applies to the plan, or on which such section will apply if the plan is determined by the Secretary to be a qualified plan.</p>
