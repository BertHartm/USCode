<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) work&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in the United States;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to secure, retain, regain, or advance in employment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) enforcement of subchapter V of this chapter and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the provision of workforce investment activities and vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, to pursue meaningful ca<!-- PDFPage:202 -->reers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) linkages between the vocational rehabilitation programs established under this subchapter and other components of the statewide workforce investment systems are critical to ensure effective and meaningful participation by individuals with disabilities in workforce investment activities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating statewide comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable programs of vocational rehabilitation, each of which is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most significant disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Individuals who are applicants for such programs or eligible to participate in such programs must be active and full partners in the vocational rehabilitation process, making meaningful and informed choices&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) during assessments for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the selection of employment outcomes for the individuals, services needed to achieve the outcomes, entities providing such services, and the methods used to secure such services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Families and other natural supports can play important roles in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability involved requests, desires, or needs such supports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Vocational rehabilitation counselors that are trained and prepared in accordance with State policies and procedures as described in section 721(a)(7)(B) of this title (referred to individually in this subchapter as a &ldquo;qualified vocational rehabilitation counselor&rdquo;), other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel facilitate the accomplishment of the employment outcomes and objectives of an individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Individuals with disabilities and the individuals&rsquo; representatives are full partners in a vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Accountability measures must facilitate the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most significant disabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">To be eligible to participate in programs under this subchapter, a State shall submit to the Commissioner a State plan for vocational rehabilitation services that meets the requirements of this section, on the same date that the State submits a State plan under section 112 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 2822].</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Nonduplication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State shall not be required to submit, in the State plan for vocational rehabilitation services, policies, procedures, or descriptions required under this subchapter that have been previously submitted to the Commissioner and that demonstrate that such State meets the requirements of this subchapter, including any policies, procedures, or descriptions submitted under this subchapter as in effect on the day before August 7, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Duration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State plan shall remain in effect subject to the submission of such modifications as the State determines to be necessary or as the Commissioner may require based on a change in State policy, a change in Federal law (including regulations), an interpretation of this chapter by a Federal court or the highest court of the State, or a finding by the Commissioner of State noncompliance with the requirements of this chapter, until the State submits and receives approval of a new State plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Commissioner, on the request of a State, may authorize the designated State agency to share funding and administrative responsibility with another agency of the State or with a local agency in order to permit the agencies to carry out a joint program to provide services to individuals with disabilities, and may waive compliance, with respect to vocational rehabilitation services furnished under the joint program, with the requirement of paragraph (4) that the plan be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in the case of American Samoa, the appropriate State agency shall be the Governor of American Samoa.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-Federal share</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State plan shall provide that the plan shall be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of any activity that, in the judgment of the Commissioner, is likely to assist in promoting the vocational rehabilitation of substantially larger numbers of individuals with disabilities or groups of individuals with disabilities, the Commissioner may waive compliance with the requirement that the plan be in effect in all political subdivisions of the State to the extent and for such period as may be provided in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner, but only if the non-Federal share of the cost of the vocational rehabilitation services involved is met from funds made available by a local agency (including funds contributed to such agency by a private agency, organization, or individual); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in a case in which earmarked funds are used toward the non-Federal share and such funds are earmarked for particular geographic areas within the State, the earmarked funds may be used in such areas if the State notifies the Commissioner that the State cannot provide the full non-Federal share without such funds.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Order of selection for vocational rehabilitation services</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Criterion for eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual is eligible for assistance under this subchapter if the individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is an individual with a disability under section 705(20)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) requires vocational rehabilitation services to prepare for, secure, retain, or regain employment.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:214 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Presumption of benefit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Demonstration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, an individual shall be presumed to be an individual that can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services under section 705(20)(A) of this title, unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making the demonstration required under subparagraph (A), the designated State unit shall explore the individual's abilities, capabilities, and capacity to perform in work situations, through the use of trial work experiences, as described in section 705(2)(D) of this title, with appropriate supports provided through the designated State unit, except under limited circumstances when an individual cannot take advantage of such experiences. Such experiences shall be of sufficient variety and over a sufficient period of time to determine the eligibility of the individual or to determine the existence of clear and convincing evidence that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Presumption of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, an individual who has a disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. and 1381 et seq.) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) considered to be an individual with a significant disability under section 705(21)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) presumed to be eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter (provided that the individual intends to achieve an employment outcome consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, capabilities, interests, and informed choice of the individual) unless the designated State unit involved can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services due to the severity of the disability of the individual in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create an entitlement to any vocational rehabilitation service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of existing information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the maximum extent appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part, for purposes of determining the eligibility of an individual for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter and developing the individualized plan for employment described in subsection (b) of this section for the individual, the designated State unit shall use information that is existing and current (as of the date of the determination of eligibility or of the development of the individualized plan for employment), including information available from other programs and providers, particularly information used by education officials and the Social Security Administration, information provided by the individual and the family of the individual, and information obtained under the assessment for determining eligibility and vocational rehabilitation needs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determinations by officials of other agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Determinations made by officials of other agencies, particularly education officials described in section 721(a)(11)(D) of this title, regarding whether an individual satisfies one or more factors relating to whether an individual is an individual with a disability under section 705(20)(A) of this title or an individual with a significant disability under section 705(21)(A) of this title shall be used, to the extent appropriate and consistent with the requirements of this part, in assisting the designated State unit in making such determinations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The determination of eligibility for vocational rehabilitation services shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the review of existing data described in section 705(2)(A)(i) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the extent that such data is unavailable or insufficient for determining eligibility, the provision of assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Determination of ineligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual who applies for services under this subchapter is determined, based on the review of existing data and, to the extent necessary, the assessment activities described in section 705(2)(A)(ii) of this title, not to be eligible for the services, or if an eligible individual receiving services under an individualized plan for employment is determined to be no longer eligible for the services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the ineligibility determination involved shall be made only after providing an opportunity for full consultation with the individual or, as appropriate, the individual's representative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the individual or, as appropriate, the individual's representative, shall be informed in writing (supplemented as necessary by other appropriate modes of communication consistent with the informed choice of the individual) of the ineligibility determination, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the reasons for the determination; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:215 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a description of the means by which the individual may express, and seek a remedy for, any dissatisfaction with the determination, including the procedures for review by an impartial hearing officer under subsection (c) of this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the individual shall be provided with a description of services available from the client assistance program under section 732 of this title and information on how to contact that program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any ineligibility determination that is based on a finding that the individual is incapable of benefiting in terms of an employment outcome shall be reviewed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) within 12 months; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) thereafter, if such a review is requested by the individual or, if appropriate, by the individual's representative.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Timeframe for making an eligibility determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The designated State unit shall determine whether an individual is eligible for vocational rehabilitation services under this subchapter within a reasonable period of time, not to exceed 60 days, after the individual has submitted an application for the services unless&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Computation; additional amount; minimum amount; adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (c) of this section, for each fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment of an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount authorized to be appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section as the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the population of the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the square of its allotment percentage,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment in an amount equal to the amount such State received under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and an additional amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment, from any amount authorized to be appropriated for such fiscal year under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section in excess of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, in an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The sum of the payment to any State (other than Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands) under this subsection for any fiscal year which is less than 1/3 of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title, or $3,000,000, whichever is greater, <!-- PDFPage:228 -->shall be increased to that amount, the total of the increases thereby required being derived by proportionately reducing the allotment to each of the remaining such States under this subsection, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the sum of the allotments made under this subsection to any such remaining State from being thereby reduced to less than that amount.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unused funds; redistribution; increase in amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 45 days prior to the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall determine, after reasonable opportunity for the submission to the Commissioner of comments by the State agency administering or supervising the program established under this subchapter, that any payment of an allotment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year will not be utilized by such State in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable but not later than the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter to one or more other States to the extent the Commissioner determines such other State will be able to use such additional amount during that fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year for carrying out such purposes. The Commissioner shall make such amount available only if such other State will be able to make sufficient payments from non-Federal sources to pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the State plan for the fiscal year for which the amount was appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this part, any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection shall be regarded as an increase of such State's allotment (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funds for American Indian vocational rehabilitation services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For fiscal year 1987 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Commissioner shall reserve from the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section a sum, determined under paragraph (2), to carry out the purposes of part C of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The sum referred to in paragraph (1) shall be, as determined by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not less than three-quarters of 1 percent and not more than 1.5 percent of the amount referred to in paragraph (1), for fiscal year 1999; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not less than 1 percent and not more than 1.5 percent of the amount referred to in paragraph (1), for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2003.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), from each State's allotment under this part for any fiscal year, the Commissioner shall pay to a State an amount equal to the Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for that State approved under section 721 of this title, including expenditures for the administration of the State plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The total of payments under paragraph (1) to a State for a fiscal year may not exceed its allotment under subsection (a) of section 730 of this title for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For fiscal year 1994 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for the previous fiscal year are less than the total of such expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commissioner may waive or modify any requirement or limitation under subparagraph (B) or section 721(a)(17) of this title if the Commissioner determines that a waiver or modification is an equitable response to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of a payment under this section with respect to any construction project in any State shall be equal to the same percentage of the cost of such project as the Federal share that is applicable in the case of rehabilitation facilities (as defined in section 291<em>o</em>(g) of title 42), in such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Federal share with respect to rehabilitation facilities in such State is determined pursuant to section 291<em>o</em>(b)(2) of title 42, the percentage of the cost for purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner designed to achieve as nearly as practicable results comparable to the results obtained under such section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:229 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of computation and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method of computing and paying amounts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Commissioner shall, prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter or other period prescribed by the Commissioner, estimate the amount to be paid to each State under the provisions of such subsection for such period, such estimate to be based on such records of the State and information furnished by it, and such other investigation as the Commissioner may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commissioner shall pay, from the allotment available therefor, the amount so estimated by the Commissioner for such period, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (not previously adjusted under this paragraph) by which the Commissioner finds that the estimate of the amount to be paid the State for any prior period under such subsection was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such prior period under such subsection. Such payment shall be made prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office, shall be made through the disbursing facilities of the Treasury Department, and shall be made in such installments as the Commissioner may determine.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;732. Client assistance program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of grant program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From funds appropriated under subsection (h) of this section, the Secretary shall, in accordance with this section, make grants to States to establish and carry out client assistance programs to provide assistance in informing and advising all clients and client applicants of all available benefits under this chapter, and, upon request of such clients or client applicants, to assist and advocate for such clients or applicants in their relationships with projects, programs, and services provided under this chapter, including assistance and advocacy in pursuing legal, administrative, or other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of the rights of such individuals under this chapter and to facilitate access to the services funded under this chapter through individual and systemic advocacy. The client assistance program shall provide information on the available services and benefits under this chapter and title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) to individuals with disabilities in the State, especially with regard to individuals with disabilities who have traditionally been unserved or underserved by vocational rehabilitation programs. In providing assistance and advocacy under this subsection with respect to services under this subchapter, a client assistance program may provide the assistance and advocacy with respect to services that are directly related to facilitating the employment of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Existence of State program as requisite to receiving payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State may receive payments from its allotment under this chapter in any fiscal year unless the State has in effect not later than October 1, 1984, a client assistance program which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has the authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of rights of individuals with disabilities who are receiving treatments, services, or rehabilitation under this chapter within the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) meets the requirements of designation under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Designation of agency to conduct program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Governor shall designate a public or private agency to conduct the client assistance program under this section. Except as provided in the last sentence of this subparagraph, the Governor shall designate an agency which is independent of any agency which provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals under this chapter. If there is an agency in the State which has, or had, prior to February 22, 1984, served as a client assistance agency under this section and which received Federal financial assistance under this chapter, the Governor may, in the initial designation, designate an agency which provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals with disabilities under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The Governor may not redesignate the agency designated under subparagraph (A) without good cause and unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Governor has given the agency 30 days notice of the intention to make such redesignation, including specification of the good cause for such redesignation and an opportunity to respond to the assertion that good cause has been shown;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) individuals with disabilities or the individuals&rsquo; representatives have timely notice of the redesignation and opportunity for public comment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the agency has the opportunity to appeal to the Commissioner on the basis that the redesignation was not for good cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If, after August 7, 1998&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a designated State agency undergoes any change in the organizational structure of the <!-- PDFPage:230 -->agency that results in the creation of one or more new State agencies or departments or results in the merger of the designated State agency with one or more other State agencies or departments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) an agency (including an office or other unit) within the designated State agency was conducting a client assistance program before the change under the last sentence of subparagraph (A),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Governor shall redesignate the agency conducting the program. In conducting the redesignation, the Governor shall designate to conduct the program an agency that is independent of any agency that provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals with disabilities under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Governor shall consult with the director of the State vocational rehabilitation agency, the head of the developmental disability protection and advocacy agency, and with representatives of professional and consumer organizations serving individuals with disabilities in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The agency designated under this subsection shall be accountable for the proper use of funds made available to the agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Class action by designated agency prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agency designated under subsection (c) of this section may not bring any class action in carrying out its responsibilities under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allotment and reallotment of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall allot the sums appropriated for each fiscal year under this section among the States on the basis of relative population of each State, except that no State shall receive less than $50,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall allot $30,000 each to American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purpose of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not include American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) In any fiscal year that the funds appropriated for such fiscal year exceed $7,500,000, the minimum allotment shall be $100,000 for States and $45,000 for territories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For any fiscal year in which the total amount appropriated under subsection (h) of this section exceeds the total amount appropriated under such subsection for the preceding fiscal year, the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments under clause (i) by a percentage that shall not exceed the percentage increase in the total amount appropriated under such subsection between the preceding fiscal year and the fiscal year involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of an allotment to a State for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required by the State during the period for which it is available for the purpose for which allotted shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary at appropriate times to other States with respect to which such a determination has not been made, in proportion to the original allotments of such States for such fiscal year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use during such period, and the total of such reduction shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any such amount so reallotted to a State for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of its allotment for such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as specifically prohibited by or as otherwise provided in State law, the Secretary shall pay to the agency designated under subsection (c) of this section the amount specified in the application approved under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Application by State for grant funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No grant may be made under this section unless the State submits an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing or accompanied by such information as the Secretary deems necessary to meet the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Regulations; minimum requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations applicable to the client assistance program which shall include the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) No employees of such programs shall, while so employed, serve as staff or consultants of any rehabilitation project, program, or facility receiving assistance under this chapter in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Each program shall be afforded reasonable access to policymaking and administrative personnel in the State and local rehabilitation programs, projects, or facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Each program shall contain provisions designed to assure that to the maximum extent possible alternative means of dispute resolution are available for use at the discretion of an applicant or client of the program prior to resorting to litigation or formal adjudication to resolve a dispute arising under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;alternative means of dispute resolution&rdquo; means any procedure, including good faith negotiation, conciliation, facilitation, mediation, factfinding, and arbitration, and any combination of procedures, that is used in lieu of litigation in a court or formal adjudication in an administrative forum, to resolve a dispute arising under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) For purposes of any periodic audit, report, or evaluation of the performance of a client assistance program under this section, the Secretary shall not require such a program to disclose the identity of, or any other personally identifiable information related to, any individual requesting assistance under such program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1999 through 2003 to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of this part, may make grants to the governing bodies of Indian tribes located on Federal and State reservations (and consortia of such governing bodies) to pay 90 percent of the costs of vocational rehabilitation services for American Indians who are individuals with disabilities residing on or near such reservations. The non-Federal share of such costs may be in cash or in kind, fairly valued, and the Commissioner may waive such non-Federal share requirement in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application; effective period; continuation of programs and services; separate service delivery systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No grant may be made under this part for any fiscal year unless an application therefor has been submitted to and approved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may not approve an application unless the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is made at such time, in such manner, and contains such information as the Commissioner may require;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contains assurances that the rehabilitation services provided under this part to American Indians who are individuals with disabilities residing on or near a reservation in a State shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, comparable to rehabilitation services provided under this subchapter to other individuals with disabilities residing in the State and that, where appropriate, may include services traditionally used by Indian tribes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contains assurances that the application was developed in consultation with the designated State unit of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of sections 450c, 450d, 450e, and 450f(a) of title 25 shall be applicable to any application submitted under this part. For purposes of this paragraph, any reference in any such provision to the Secretary of Education or to the Secretary of the Interior shall be considered to be a reference to the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any application approved under this part shall be effective for not more than 60 months, except as determined otherwise by the Commissioner pursuant to prescribed regulations. The State shall continue to provide vocational rehabilitation services under its State plan to American Indians residing on or near a reservation whenever such State includes any such American Indians in its State population under section 730(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In making grants under this part, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to applications for the continuation of programs which have been funded under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize a separate service delivery system for Indian residents of a State who reside in non-reservation areas.</p>
