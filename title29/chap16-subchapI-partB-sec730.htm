<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, for each fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment of an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount authorized to be appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section as the product of (A) the population of the State, and (B) the square of its allotment percentage, bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment in an amount equal to the amount such State received under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and an additional amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and the square of its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1984, for which any amount is appropriated pursuant to section 720(b)(1)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title, each State shall receive an allocation (from such appropriated amount) in addition to the allotment to which such State is entitled under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any payment attributable to the additional payment to a State under this subsection shall be made only from appropriations specifically made to carry out this subsection, and such additional appropriations are hereby authorized.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than forty-five days prior to the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall determine, after reasonable opportunity for the submission to the Commissioner of comments by the State agency administering or supervising the program established under this subchapter, that any payment of an allotment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year will not be utilized by such State in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable but not later than the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter to one or more other States to the extent the Commissioner determines that such other State will be able to use such additional amount during that fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year for car<!-- PDFPage:227 -->rying out such purposes. The Commissioner shall make such amount available only if such other State will be able to make sufficient payments from non-Federal sources to pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the State plan for the fiscal year for which the amount was appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this part, any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection shall be regarded as an increase of such State's allotment (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) For fiscal year 1987 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Commissioner shall reserve from the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section a sum, determined under paragraph (2), to carry out the purposes of part D of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The sum referred to in paragraph (1) shall be, as determined by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
