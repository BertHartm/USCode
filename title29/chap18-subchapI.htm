<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Benefit plans as affecting interstate commerce and the Federal taxing power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the growth in size, scope, and numbers of employee benefit plans in recent years has been rapid and substantial; that the operational scope and economic impact of such plans is increasingly interstate; that the continued well-being and security of millions of employees and their dependents are directly affected by these plans; that they are affected with a national public interest; that they have become an important factor affecting the stability of employment and the successful development of industrial relations; that they have become an important factor in commerce because of the interstate character of their activities, and of the activities of their participants, and the employers, employee organizations, and other entities by which they are established or maintained; that a large volume of the activities of such plans are carried on by means of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate commerce; that owing to the lack of employee information and adequate safeguards concerning their operation, it is desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, and to provide for the general welfare and the free flow of commerce, that disclosure be made and safeguards be provided with respect to the establishment, operation, and administration of such plans; that they substantially affect the revenues of the United States because they are af<!-- PDFPage:322 -->forded preferential Federal tax treatment; that despite the enormous growth in such plans many employees with long years of employment are losing anticipated retirement benefits owing to the lack of vesting provisions in such plans; that owing to the inadequacy of current minimum standards, the soundness and stability of plans with respect to adequate funds to pay promised benefits may be endangered; that owing to the termination of plans before requisite funds have been accumulated, employees and their beneficiaries have been deprived of anticipated benefits; and that it is therefore desirable in the interests of employees and their beneficiaries, for the protection of the revenue of the United States, and to provide for the free flow of commerce, that minimum standards be provided assuring the equitable character of such plans and their financial soundness.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Protection of interstate commerce and beneficiaries by requiring disclosure and reporting, setting standards of conduct, etc., for fiduciaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce and the interests of participants in employee benefit plans and their beneficiaries, by requiring the disclosure and reporting to participants and beneficiaries of financial and other information with respect thereto, by establishing standards of conduct, responsibility, and obligation for fiduciaries of employee benefit plans, and by providing for appropriate remedies, sanctions, and ready access to the Federal courts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Protection of interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and beneficiaries by vesting of accrued benefits, setting minimum standards of funding, requiring termination insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby further declared to be the policy of this chapter to protect interstate commerce, the Federal taxing power, and the interests of participants in private pension plans and their beneficiaries by improving the equitable character and the soundness of such plans by requiring them to vest the accrued benefits of employees with significant periods of service, to meet minimum standards of funding, and by requiring plan termination insurance.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">Today I am submitting to the Congress my fourth Reorganization Plan for 1978. This proposal is designed to simplify and improve the unnecessarily complex administrative requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) [see Short Title note set out under this section]. The new plan will eliminate overlap and duplication in the administration of ERISA and help us achieve our goal of well regulated private pension plans.</p>
<p class="note-body">ERISA was an essential step in the protection of worker pension rights. Its administrative provisions, however, have resulted in bureaucratic confusion and have been justifiably criticized by employers and unions alike. The biggest problem has been overlapping jurisdictional authority. Under current ERISA provisions, the Departments of Treasury and Labor both have authority to issue regulations and decisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">This dual jurisdiction has delayed a good many important rulings and, more importantly, produced bureaucratic runarounds and burdensome reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">The new plan will significantly reduce these problems. In addition, both Departments are trying to cut red tape and paperwork, to eliminate unnecessary reporting requirements, and to streamline forms wherever possible.</p>
<p class="note-body">Both Departments have already made considerable progress, and both will continue the effort to simplify their rules and their forms.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Reorganization Plan is the most significant result of their joint effort to modify and simplify ERISA. It will eliminate most of the jurisdictional overlap between Treasury and Labor by making the following changes:</p>
<p class="note-body">1) Treasury will have statutory authority for minimum standards. The new plan puts all responsibility for funding, participation, and vesting of benefit rights in the Department of Treasury. These standards are necessary to ensure that employee benefit plans are adequately funded and that all beneficiary rights are protected. Treasury is the most appropriate Department to administer these provisions; however, Labor will continue to have veto power over Treasury decisions that significantly affect collectively bargained plans.</p>
<p class="note-body">2) Labor will have statutory authority for fiduciary obligations. ERISA prohibits transactions in which self-interest or conflict of interest could occur, but allows certain exemptions from these prohibitions. Labor will be responsible for overseeing fiduciary conduct under these provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">3) Both Departments will retain enforcement powers. The Reorganization Plan will continue Treasury's authority to audit plans and levy tax penalties for any deviation from standards. The plan will also continue Labor's authority to bring civil action against plans and fiduciaries. These provisions are retained in order to keep the special expertise of each Department available. New coordination between the Departments will eliminate duplicative investigations of alleged violations.</p>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization will make an immediate improvement in ERISA's administration. It will eliminate almost all of the dual and overlapping authority in the two departments and dramatically cut the time re<!-- PDFPage:327 -->quired to process applications for exemptions from prohibited transactions.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan is an interim arrangement. After the Departments have had a chance to administer ERISA under this new plan, the Office of Management and Budget and the Departments will jointly evaluate that experience. Based on that evaluation, early in 1980, the Administration will make appropriate legislative proposals to establish a long-term administrative structure for ERISA.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each provision in this reorganization will accomplish one or more of the purposes in Title 5 of U.S.C. 901(a). There will be no change in expenditure or personnel levels, although a small number of people will be transferred from the Department of Treasury to the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="note-body">We all recognize that the administration of ERISA has been unduly burdensome. I am confident that this reorganization will significantly relieve much of that burden.</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan is the culmination of our effort to streamline ERISA. It provides an administrative arrangement that will work.</p>
<p class="note-body">ERISA has been a symbol of unnecessarily complex government regulation. I hope this new step will become equally symbolic of my Administration's commitment to making government more effective and less intrusive in the lives of our people.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Effects of multiemployer pension plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) multiemployer pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) multiemployer pension plans have accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in private pension plan coverage over the past three decades;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the continued well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by multiemployer pension plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in subparagraph (A) are exacerbated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to foster and facilitate interstate commerce,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to alleviate certain problems which tend to discourage the maintenance and growth of multiemployer pension plans,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide reasonable protection for the interests of participants and beneficiaries of financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide a financially self-sufficient program for the guarantee of employee benefits under multiemployer plans.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:328 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) single-employer defined benefit pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national interest;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that modification of the current termination insurance system and an increase in the insurance premium for single-employer defined benefit pension plans&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">such carrier, organization, bank, institution, or plan sponsor shall transmit and certify the accuracy of such information to the administrator within 120 days after the end of the plan year (or such other date as may be prescribed under regulations of the Secretary).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the administrator of an employee benefit plan shall engage, on behalf of all plan participants, an independent qualified public accountant, who <!-- PDFPage:341 -->shall conduct such an examination of any financial statements of the plan, and of other books and records of the plan, as the accountant may deem necessary to enable the accountant to form an opinion as to whether the financial statements and schedules required to be included in the annual reports by subsection (b) of this section are presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year. Such examination shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and shall involve such tests of the books and records of the plan as are considered necessary by the independent qualified public accountant. The independent qualified public accountant shall also offer his opinion as to whether the separate schedules specified in subsection (b)(3) of this section and the summary material required under section 1024(b)(3) of this title present fairly, and in all material respects the information contained therein when considered in conjunction with the financial statements taken as a whole. The opinion by the independent qualified public accountant shall be made a part of the annual report.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1024. Filing and furnishing of information</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Filing of annual report with Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrator of any employee benefit plan subject to this part shall file with the Secretary the annual report for a plan year within 210 days after the close of such year (or within such time as may be required by regulations promulgated by the Secretary in order to reduce duplicative filing). The Secretary shall make copies of such annual reports available for inspection in the public document room of the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to annual reports required to be filed with the Secretary under this part, he may by regulation prescribe simplified annual reports for any pension plan which covers less than 100 participants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Nothing contained in this paragraph shall preclude the Secretary from requiring any information or data from any such plan to which this part applies where he finds such data or information is necessary to carry out the purposes of <!-- PDFPage:345 -->this subchapter nor shall the Secretary be precluded from revoking provisions for simplified reports for any such plan if he finds it necessary to do so in order to carry out the objectives of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may by regulation exempt any welfare benefit plan from all or part of the reporting and disclosure requirements of this subchapter, or may provide for simplified reporting and disclosure if he finds that such requirements are inappropriate as applied to welfare benefit plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may reject any filing under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if he determines that such filing is incomplete for purposes of this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if he determines that there is any material qualification by an accountant or actuary contained in an opinion submitted pursuant to section 1023(a)(3)(A) or section 1023(a)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If the Secretary rejects a filing of a report under paragraph (4) and if a revised filing satisfactory to the Secretary is not submitted within 45 days after the Secretary makes his determination under paragraph (4) to reject the filing, and if the Secretary deems it in the best interest of the participants, he may take any one or more of the following actions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) retain an independent qualified public accountant (as defined in section 1023(a)(3)(D) of this title) on behalf of the participants to perform an audit,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) retain an enrolled actuary (as defined in section 1023(a)(4)(C) of this title) on behalf of the plan participants, to prepare an actuarial statement,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) bring a civil action for such legal or equitable relief as may be appropriate to enforce the provisions of this part, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) take any other action authorized by this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The administrator shall permit such accountant or actuary to inspect whatever books and records of the plan are necessary for such audit. The plan shall be liable to the Secretary for the expenses for such audit or report, and the Secretary may bring an action against the plan in any court of competent jurisdiction to recover such expenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The administrator of any employee benefit plan subject to this part shall furnish to the Secretary, upon request, any documents relating to the employee benefit plan, including but not limited to, the latest summary plan description (including any summaries of plan changes not contained in the summary plan description), and the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instrument under which the plan is established or operated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Publication of summary plan description and annual report to participants and beneficiaries of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Publication of the summary plan descriptions and annual reports shall be made to participants and beneficiaries of the particular plan as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrator shall furnish to each participant, and each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan, a copy of the summary plan description, and all modifications and changes referred to in section 1022(a) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within 90 days after he becomes a participant, or (in the case of a beneficiary) within 90 days after he first receives benefits, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if later, within 120 days after the plan becomes subject to this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The administrator shall furnish to each participant, and each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan, every fifth year after the plan becomes subject to this part an updated summary plan description described in section 1022 of this title which integrates all plan amendments made within such five-year period, except that in a case where no amendments have been made to a plan during such five-year period this sentence shall not apply. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the administrator shall furnish to each participant, and to each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan, the summary plan description described in section 1022 of this title every tenth year after the plan becomes subject to this part. If there is a modification or change described in section 1022(a) of this title (other than a material reduction in covered services or benefits provided in the case of a group health plan (as defined in section 1191b(a)(1) of this title)), a summary description of such modification or change shall be furnished not later than 210 days after the end of the plan year in which the change is adopted to each participant, and to each beneficiary who is receiving benefits under the plan. If there is a modification or change described in section 1022(a) of this title that is a material reduction in covered services or benefits provided under a group health plan (as defined in section 1191b(a)(1) of this title), a summary description of such modification or change shall be furnished to participants and beneficiaries not later than 60 days after the date of the adoption of the modification or change. In the alternative, the plan sponsors may provide such description at regular intervals of not more than 90 days. The Secretary shall issue regulations within 180 days after August 21, 1996, providing alternative mechanisms to delivery by mail through which group health plans (as so defined) may notify participants and beneficiaries of material reductions in covered services or benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The administrator shall make copies of the latest updated summary plan description and the latest annual report and the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan was established or is operated available for examination by any plan participant or beneficiary in the principal office of the administrator and in such other places as may be necessary to make available all pertinent information to all participants (including such places as the Secretary may prescribe by regulations).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 210 days after the close of the fiscal year of the plan, the administrator shall furnish to each participant, and to each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan, a copy of the statements and schedules, for such fiscal year, described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of section 1023(b)(3) of this title and such other material (including the percentage determined under sec<!-- PDFPage:346 -->tion 1023(d)(11) of this title) as is necessary to fairly summarize the latest annual report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The administrator shall, upon written request of any participant or beneficiary, furnish a copy of the latest updated summary,<sup><a href="#1024_1_target" name="1024_1">1</a></sup> plan description, and the latest annual report, any terminal report, the bargaining agreement, trust agreement, contract, or other instruments under which the plan is established or operated. The administrator may make a reasonable charge to cover the cost of furnishing such complete copies. The Secretary may by regulation prescribe the maximum amount which will constitute a reasonable charge under the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Statement of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may by regulation require that the administrator of any employee benefit plan furnish to each participant and to each beneficiary receiving benefits under the plan a statement of the rights of participants and beneficiaries under this subchapter.</p>

This clause shall not apply to any plan to which any mandatory contribution is made after September 2, 1974.

(2) generally, substituting provisions covering 5-year vesting, 3- to 7-year vesting, and multiemployer plans, for former provisions which covered 10-year vesting, 5- to 15-year vesting, and the &ldquo;rule of 45&rdquo; under which a plan satisfied the requirements of this paragraph if an employee who had completed at least 5 years of service and with respect to whom the sum of his age and years of service equalled or exceeded 45 had a right to a percentage of his accrued benefits derived from employer contributions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (a)(3)(D)(ii). Pub.

(1) read as follows: &ldquo;If the present value of any accrued benefit exceeds $3,500, such benefit shall not be treated as nonforfeitable if the plan provides that the present value of such benefit could be immediately distributed without the consent of the participant.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (e)(2). Pub. L. 99&ndash;514, &sect;1139(c)(1), amended par. (2) generally. Prior to amendment, par.

<p class="note-body">1984&mdash;Subsec. (b)(1)(A). Pub. L. 98&ndash;397, &sect;102(b), substituted &ldquo;18&rdquo; for &ldquo;22&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsec. (b)(3)(D). Pub. L. 98&ndash;397, &sect;102(d)(2), amended subpar. (D) generally. Prior to amendment, subpar.

Such aggregate number of years of service before such break shall be deemed not to include any years of service not required to be taken into account under this subparagraph by reason of any prior break in service.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Satisfaction of requirements by pension plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section, and&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:358 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a defined benefit plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a defined contribution plan, shall satisfy the requirements of subsection (b)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enumeration of plan requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which each participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 3 percent of the normal retirement benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age if he commenced participation at the earliest possible entry age under the plan and served continuously until the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the number of years (not in excess of 331/3) of his participation in the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan providing retirement benefits based on compensation during any period, the normal retirement benefit to which a participant would be entitled shall be determined as if he continued to earn annually the average rate of compensation which he earned during consecutive years of service, not in excess of 10, for which his compensation was the highest. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph of a particular plan year if under the plan the accrued benefit payable at the normal retirement age is equal to the normal retirement benefit and the annual rate at which any individual who is or could be a participant can accrue the retirement benefits payable at normal retirement age under the plan for any later plan year is not more than 1331/3 percent of the annual rate at which he can accrue benefits for any plan year beginning on or after such particular plan year and before such later plan year. For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any amendment to the plan which is in effect for the current year shall be treated as in effect for all other plan years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any change in an accrual rate which does not apply to any individual who is or could be a participant in the current year shall be disregarded;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the fact that benefits under the plan may be payable to certain employees before normal retirement age shall be disregarded; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after the current year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if the accrued benefit to which any participant is entitled upon his separation from the service is not less than a fraction of the annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age to which he would be entitled under the plan as in effect on the date of his separation if he continued to earn annually until normal retirement age the same rate of compensation upon which his normal retirement benefit would be computed under the plan, determined as if he had attained normal retirement age on the date any such determination is made (but taking into account no more than the 10 years of service immediately preceding his separation from service). Such fraction shall be a fraction, not exceeding 1, the numerator of which is the total number of his years of participation in the plan (as of the date of his separation from the service) and the denominator of which is the total number of years he would have participated in the plan if he separated from the service at the normal retirement age. For purposes of this subparagraph, social security benefits and all other relevant factors used to compute benefits shall be treated as remaining constant as of the current year for all years after such current year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) shall not apply with respect to years of participation before the first plan year to which this section applies but a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this subparagraph with respect to such years of participation only if the accrued benefit of any participant with respect to such years of participation is not less than the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) his accrued benefit determined under the plan, as in effect from time to time prior to September 2, 1974, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an accrued benefit which is not less than one-half of the accrued benefit to which such participant would have been entitled if subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) applied with respect to such years of participation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of this paragraph, a plan shall not be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph solely because the accrual of benefits under the plan does not become effective until the employee has two continuous years of service. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;year of service&rdquo; has the meaning provided by section 1052(a)(3)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C), a defined benefit plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if such plan</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is funded exclusively by the purchase of insurance contracts, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 1081(b) of this title (relating to certain insurance contract plans),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but only if an employee's accrued benefit as of any applicable date is not less than the cash surrender value his insurance contracts would have on such applicable date if the requirements of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) of section 1081(b) of this title were satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if the participant's accrued benefit is reduced on account of any increase in his age or service. The preceding sentence shall not apply to benefits under the plan commencing before benefits payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] which benefits under the plan&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:359 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) do not exceed social security benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) terminate when such social security benefits commence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) Notwithstanding the preceding subparagraphs, a defined benefit plan shall be treated as not satisfying the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, an employee's benefit accrual is ceased, or the rate of an employee's benefit accrual is reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subparagraph solely because the plan imposes (without regard to age) a limitation on the amount of benefits that the plan provides or a limitation on the number of years of service or years of participation which are taken into account for purposes of determining benefit accrual under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In the case of any employee who, as of the end of any plan year under a defined benefit plan, has attained normal retirement age under such plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has commenced as of the end of such plan year, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of in-service distribution of benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if distribution of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee has not commenced as of the end of such year in accordance with section 1056(a)(3) of this title, and the payment of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee is not suspended during such plan year pursuant to section 1053(a)(3)(B) of this title, then any requirement of this subparagraph for continued accrual of benefits under such plan with respect to such employee during such plan year shall be treated as satisfied to the extent of any adjustment in the benefit payable under the plan during such plan year attributable to the delay in the distribution of benefits after the attainment of normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The preceding provisions of this clause shall apply in accordance with regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury. Such regulations may provide for the application of the preceding provisions of this clause, in the case of any such employee, with respect to any period of time within a plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any employee who is a highly compensated employee (within the meaning of section 414(q) of title 26) to the extent provided in regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury for purposes of precluding discrimination in favor of highly compensated employees within the meaning of subchapter D of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to clause (v) of section 411(b)(1)(H) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this subparagraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(1)(H).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A defined contribution plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if, under the plan, allocations to the employee's account are not ceased, and the rate at which amounts are allocated to the employee's account is not reduced, because of the attainment of any age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of subparagraph (A) solely because the subsidized portion of any early retirement benefit is disregarded in determining benefit accruals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to subparagraphs (B) and (C) of section 411(b)(2) of title 26 shall apply with respect to the requirements of this paragraph in the same manner and to the same extent as such regulations apply with respect to the requirements of such section 411(b)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A plan satisfies the requirements of this paragraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for the portion of each employee's accrued benefit derived from any voluntary employee contributions permitted under the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any plan which is not a defined benefit plan, the plan requires separate accounting for each employee's accrued benefit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of determining an employee's accrued benefit, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; means a period of service (beginning at the earliest date on which the employee is a participant in the plan and which is included in a period of service required to be taken into account under section 1052(b) of this title, determined without regard to section 1052(b)(5) of this title) as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary which provide for the calculation of such period on any reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, except as provided in subparagraph (C), in the case of any employee whose customary employment is less than full time, the calculation of such employee's service on any basis which provides less than a ratable portion of the accrued benefit to which he would be entitled under the plan if his customary employment were full time shall not be treated as made on a reasonable and consistent basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, in the case of any employee whose service is less than 1,000 hours during any calendar year, plan year or other 12-consecutive-month period designated by the plan (and not prohibited under regulations prescribed by the Secretary) the calculation of his period of service shall not be treated as not made on a reasonable and consistent basis merely because such service is not taken into account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of any seasonal industry where the customary period of employment is less than 1,000 hours during a calendar year, the term &ldquo;year of participation&rdquo; shall be such period as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:360 --><p class="statutory-body">(E) For purposes of this subsection in the case of any maritime industry, 125 days of service shall be treated as a year of participation. The Secretary may prescribe regulations to carry out the purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Employee's accrued benefits derived from employer and employee contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section and section 1053 of this title an employee's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions as of any applicable date is the excess (if any) of the accrued benefit for such employee as of such applicable date over the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by such employee as of such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a plan other than a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) except as provided in clause (ii), the balance of the employee's separate account consisting only of his contributions and the income, expenses, gains, and losses attributable thereto, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if a separate account is not maintained with respect to an employee's contributions under such a plan, the amount which bears the same ratio to his total accrued benefit as the total amount of the employee's contributions (less withdrawals) bears to the sum of such contributions and the contributions made on his behalf by the employer (less withdrawals).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) <cap-smallcap>Defined benefit plans</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a defined benefit plan, the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee as of any applicable date is the amount equal to the employee's accumulated contributions expressed as an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, using an interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;accumulated contributions&rdquo; means the total of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) all mandatory contributions made by the employee,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) interest (if any) under the plan to the end of the last plan year to which section 1053(a)(2) of this title does not apply (by reason of the applicable effective date), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) interest on the sum of the amounts determined under clauses (i) and (ii) compounded annually&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) at the rate of 120 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of a plan year for the period beginning with the 1st plan year to which subsection (a)(2) of this section applies by reason of the applicable effective date) and ending with the date on which the determination is being made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) at the interest rate which would be used under the plan under section 1055(g)(3) of this title (as of the determination date) for the period beginning with the determination date and ending on the date on which the employee attains normal retirement age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;mandatory contributions&rdquo; means amounts contributed to the plan by the employee which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plans, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to adjust by regulation the conversion factor described in subparagraph (B) from time to time as he may deem necessary. No such adjustment shall be effective for a plan year beginning before the expiration of 1 year after such adjustment is determined and published.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, in the case of any defined benefit plan, if an employee's accrued benefit is to be determined as an amount other than an annual benefit commencing at normal retirement age, or if the accrued benefit derived from contributions made by an employee is to be determined with respect to a benefit other than an annual benefit in the form of a single life annuity (without ancillary benefits) commencing at normal retirement age, the employee's accrued benefit, or the accrued benefits derived from contributions made by an employee, as the case may be, shall be the actuarial equivalent of such benefit or amount determined under paragraph (1) or (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of a defined benefit plan which permits voluntary employee contributions, the portion of an employee's accrued benefit derived from such contributions shall be treated as an accrued benefit derived from employee contributions under a plan other than a defined benefit plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Employee service which may be disregarded in determining employee's accrued benefits under plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1053(b)(1) of this title, for purposes of determining the employee's accrued benefit under the plan, the plan may disregard service performed by the employee with respect to which he has received&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a distribution of the present value of his entire nonforfeitable benefit if such distribution was in an amount (not more than the dollar limit under section 1053(e)(1) of this title) permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, or</p>

Paragraph (2) shall apply only if such distribution was made on termination of the employee's participation in the plan or under such other circumstances as may be provided under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Opportunity to repay full amount of distributions which have been reduced through disregarded employee service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the employee's accrued benefit, the plan shall not disregard service as provided in subsection (d) of this section unless the plan provides an opportunity for the participant to repay the full amount of a distribution described in subsection (d) of this section with, in the case of a defined benefit <!-- PDFPage:361 -->plan, interest at the rate determined for purposes of subsection (c)(2)(C) of this section and provides that upon such repayment the employee's accrued benefit shall be recomputed by taking into account service so disregarded. This subsection shall apply only in the case of a participant who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) received such a distribution in any plan year to which this section applies which distribution was less than the present value of his accrued benefit,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The plan provision required under this subsection may provide that such repayment must be made (A) in the case of a withdrawal on account of separation from service, before the earlier of 5 years after the first date on which the participant is subsequently re-employed by the employer, or the close of the first period of 5 consecutive 1-year breaks in service commencing after the withdrawal; or (B) in the case of any other withdrawal, 5 years after the date of the withdrawal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Employer treated as maintaining a plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this part, an employer shall be treated as maintaining a plan if any employee of such employer accrues benefits under such plan by reason of service with such employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The accrued benefit of a participant under a plan may not be decreased by an amendment of the plan, other than an amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) or 1441 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan amendment which has the effect of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) eliminating or reducing an early retirement benefit or a retirement-type subsidy (as defined in regulations), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) eliminating an optional form of benefit,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">with respect to benefits attributable to service before the amendment shall be treated as reducing accrued benefits. In the case of a retirement-type subsidy, the preceding sentence shall apply only with respect to a participant who satisfies (either before or after the amendment) the preamendment conditions for the subsidy. The Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide that this paragraph shall not apply to any plan amendment which reduces or eliminates benefits or subsidies which create significant burdens or complexities for the plan and plan participants, unless such amendment adversely affects the rights of any participant in a more than de minimis manner. The Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that this subparagraph shall not apply to a plan amendment described in subparagraph (B) (other than a plan amendment having an effect described in subparagraph (A)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 409(a) of title 26, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;transferee plan&rdquo;) shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of this subsection merely because the transferee plan does not provide some or all of the forms of distribution previously available under another defined contribution plan (in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;transferor plan&rdquo;) to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the forms of distribution previously available under the transferor plan applied to the account of a participant or beneficiary under the transferor plan that was transferred from the transferor plan to the transferee plan pursuant to a direct transfer rather than pursuant to a distribution from the transferor plan;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a single sum payment is available to such participant at the same time or times as the form of distribution being eliminated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such single sum payment is based on the same or greater portion of the participant's account as the form of distribution being eliminated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Notice of significant reduction in benefit accruals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An applicable pension plan may not be amended so as to provide for a significant reduction in the rate of future benefit accrual unless the plan administrator provides the notice described in paragraph (2) to each applicable individual (and to each employee organization representing applicable individuals).</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1056. Form and payment of benefits</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Commencement date for payment of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan shall provide that unless the participant otherwise elects, the payment of benefits under the plan to the participant shall begin not later than the 60th day after the latest of the close of the plan year in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) occurs the date on which the participant attains the earlier of age 65 or the normal retirement age specified under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) occurs the 10th anniversary of the year in which the participant commenced participation in the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the participant terminates his service with the employer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan which provides for the payment of an early retirement benefit, such plan shall provide that a participant who satisfied the service requirements for such early retirement benefit, but separated from the service (with any nonforfeitable right to an accrued benefit) before satisfying the age requirement for such early retirement benefit, is entitled upon satisfaction of such age requirement to receive a benefit not less than the benefit to which he would be entitled at the normal retirement age, actuarially reduced under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Decrease in plan benefits by reason of increases in benefit levels under Social Security Act or Railroad Retirement Act of 1937</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a participant or beneficiary is receiving benefits under a pension plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a participant is separated from the service and has non-forfeitable rights to benefits,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">a plan may not decrease benefits of such a participant by reason of any increase in the benefit levels payable under title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] or the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] or any increase in the wage base under such title II, if such increase takes place after September 2, 1974, or (if later) the earlier of the date of first entitlement of such benefits or the date of such separation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forfeiture of accrued benefits derived from employer contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No pension plan may provide that any part of a participant's accrued benefit derived from employer contributions (whether or not otherwise nonforfeitable) is forfeitable solely because of withdrawal by such participant of any amount attributable to the benefit derived from contributions made by such participant. The preceding sentence shall not apply (1) to the accrued benefit of any participant unless, at the time of such withdrawal, such participant has a nonforfeitable right to at least 50 percent of such accrued benefit, or (2) to the extent that an accrued benefit is permitted to be forfeited in accordance with section 1053(a)(3)(D)(iii) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assignment or alienation of plan benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each pension plan shall provide that benefits provided under the plan may not be assigned or alienated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of paragraph (1) of this subsection, there shall not be taken into account any voluntary and revocable assignment of not to exceed 10 percent of any benefit payment, or of any irrevocable assignment or alienation of benefits executed before September 2, 1974. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any assignment or alienation made for the purposes of defraying plan administration costs. For purposes of this paragraph a loan made to a participant or beneficiary shall not be treated as an assignment or alienation if such loan is secured by the participant's accrued non-forfeitable benefit and is exempt from the tax imposed by section 4975 of title 26 (relating to tax on prohibited transactions) by reason of section 4975(d)(1) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Paragraph (1) shall apply to the creation, assignment, or recognition of a right to any benefit payable with respect to a participant pursuant to a domestic relations order, except that paragraph (1) shall not apply if the order is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order. Each pension plan shall provide for the payment of benefits in accordance with the applicable requirements of any qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;qualified domestic relations order&rdquo; means a domestic relations order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits payable with respect to a participant under a plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) with respect to which the requirements of subparagraphs (C) and (D) are met, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the term &ldquo;domestic relations order&rdquo; means any judgment, decree, or order (including approval of a property settlement agreement) which&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:372 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) relates to the provision of child support, alimony payments, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependent of a participant, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order clearly specifies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the name and the last known mailing address (if any) of the participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by the order,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits to be paid by the plan to each such alternate payee, or the manner in which such amount or percentage is to be determined,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the number of payments or period to which such order applies, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) each plan to which such order applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A domestic relations order meets the requirements of this subparagraph only if such order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) does not require the plan to provide increased benefits (determined on the basis of actuarial value), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) does not require the payment of benefits to an alternate payee which are required to be paid to another alternate payee under another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) A domestic relations order shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of clause (i) of subparagraph (D) solely because such order requires that payment of benefits be made to an alternate payee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) in the case of any payment before a participant has separated from service, on or after the date on which the participant attains (or would have attained) the earliest retirement age,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) as if the participant had retired on the date on which such payment is to begin under such order (but taking into account only the present value of benefits actually accrued and not taking into account the present value of any employer subsidy for early retirement), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) in any form in which such benefits may be paid under the plan to the participant (other than in the form of a joint and survivor annuity with respect to the alternate payee and his or her subsequent spouse).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subclause (II), the interest rate assumption used in determining the present value shall be the interest rate specified in the plan or, if no rate is specified, 5 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;earliest retirement age&rdquo; means the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the date on which the participant is entitled to a distribution under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the later of the date of the participant attains age 50 or the earliest date on which the participant could begin receiving benefits under the plan if the participant separated from service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F) To the extent provided in any qualified domestic relations order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the former spouse of a participant shall be treated as a surviving spouse of such participant for purposes of section 1055 of this title (and any spouse of the participant shall not be treated as a spouse of the participant for such purposes), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if married for at least 1 year, the surviving former spouse shall be treated as meeting the requirements of section 1055(f) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In the case of any domestic relations order received by a plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the plan administrator shall promptly notify the participant and each alternate payee of the receipt of such order and the plan's procedures for determining the qualified status of domestic relations orders, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) within a reasonable period after receipt of such order, the plan administrator shall determine whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order and notify the participant and each alternate payee of such determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Each plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine the qualified status of domestic relations orders and to administer distributions under such qualified orders. Such procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) shall be in writing,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) shall provide for the notification of each person specified in a domestic relations order as entitled to payment of benefits under the plan (at the address included in the domestic relations order) of such procedures promptly upon receipt by the plan of the domestic relations order, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) shall permit an alternate payee to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the alternate payee with respect to a domestic relations order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) During any period in which the issue of whether a domestic relations order is a qualified domestic relations order is being determined (by the plan administrator, by a court of competent jurisdiction, or otherwise), the plan administrator shall separately account for the amounts (hereinafter in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;segregated amounts&rdquo;) which would have been payable to the alternate payee during such period if the order had been determined to be a qualified domestic relations order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v) the order (or modification thereof) is determined to be a qualified domestic relations order, the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest thereon) to the person or persons entitled thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If within the 18-month period described in clause (v)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) it is determined that the order is not a qualified domestic relations order, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the issue as to whether such order is a qualified domestic relations order is not resolved,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the plan administrator shall pay the segregated amounts (including any interest there<!-- PDFPage:373 -->on) to the person or persons who would have been entitled to such amounts if there had been no order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Any determination that an order is a qualified domestic relations order which is made after the close of the 18-month period described in clause (v) shall be applied prospectively only.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the 18-month period described in this clause is the 18-month period beginning with the date on which the first payment would be required to be made under the domestic relations order.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1082. Minimum funding standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Avoidance of accumulated funding deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Every employee pension benefit plan subject to this part shall satisfy the minimum funding standard (or the alternative minimum funding standard under section 1085 of this title) for any plan year to which this part applies. A plan to which this part applies shall have satisfied the minimum funding standard for such plan for a plan year if as of the end of such plan year the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;accumulated funding deficiency&rdquo; means for any plan the excess of the total charges to the funding standard account for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year to which this part applies) over the total credits to such account for such years or, if less, the excess of the total charges to the alternative minimum funding standard account for such plan years over the total credits to such account for such years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In any plan year in which a multiemployer plan is in reorganization, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan shall be determined under section 1423 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding standard account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each plan to which this part applies shall establish and maintain a funding standard account. Such account shall be credited and charged solely as provided in this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be charged with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the normal cost of the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amounts necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of a plan in existence on January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this part applies, over a period of 40 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of a plan which comes into existence after January 1, 1974, the unfunded past service liability under the plan on the first day of the first plan year to which this part applies, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net increase (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience loss (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net loss (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:380 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the amount necessary to amortize each waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1083(c) of this title) for each prior plan year in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 5 plan years any amount credited to the funding standard account under paragraph (3)(D), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over a period of 20 years the contributions which would be required to be made under the plan but for the provisions of subsection (c)(7)(A)(i)(I) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For a plan year, the funding standard account shall be credited with the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount considered contributed by the employer to or under the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount necessary to amortize in equal annual installments (until fully amortized)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net decrease (if any) in unfunded past service liability under the plan arising from plan amendments adopted in such year, over a period of 30 plan years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net experience gain (if any) under the plan, over a period of 5 plan years (15 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) separately, with respect to each plan year, the net gain (if any) resulting from changes in actuarial assumptions used under the plan, over a period of 10 plan years (30 plan years in the case of a multiemployer plan),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the amount of the waived funding deficiency (within the meaning of section 1083(c) of this title) for the plan year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of a plan year for which the accumulated funding deficiency is determined under the funding standard account if such plan year follows a plan year for which such deficiency was determined under the alternative minimum funding standard, the excess (if any) of any debit balance in the funding standard account (determined without regard to this subparagraph) over any debit balance in the alternative minimum funding standard account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, amounts required to be amortized under paragraph (2) or paragraph (3), as the case may be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may be combined into one amount under such paragraph to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization period for all items entering into such combined amount, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Interest.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Required change of interest rate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of determining a plan's current liability and for purposes of determining a plan's required contribution under subsection (d) of this section for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If any rate of interest used under the plan to determine cost is not within the permissible range, the plan shall establish a new rate of interest within the permissible range.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Permissible range</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in subclause (II), the term &ldquo;permissible range&rdquo; means a rate of interest which is not more than 10 percent above, and not more than 10 percent below, the the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1082_1_target" name="1082_1">1</a></sup> weighted average of the rates of interest on 30-year Treasury securities during the 4-year period ending on the last day before the beginning of the plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) <cap-smallcap>Secretarial authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Secretary finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, the Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under subclause (I).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Assumptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding subsection (c)(3)(A)(i) of this section, the interest rate used under the plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In the case of a plan which, immediately before September 26, 1980, was a multiemployer plan (within the meaning of section 1002(37) of this title as in effect immediately before such date)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), (2)(B)(iii), or (3)(B)(i) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any amount described in paragraph (2)(B)(iv) or (3)(B)(ii) of this subsection which arose in a plan year beginning before such date shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 20 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the amount arose;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:381 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 3 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from a plan amendment adopted before such date, shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the change arises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any change in past service liability which arises during the period of 2 plan years beginning on or after such date, and results from the changing of a group of participants from one benefit level to another benefit level under a schedule of plan benefits which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was adopted before such date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) was effective for any plan participant before the beginning of the first plan year beginning on or after such date,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">shall be amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 40 plan years, beginning with the plan year in which the increase arises.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If a plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The preceding sentence shall not apply to the extent of any accumulated funding deficiency under section 418B(a) of title 26 as of the end of the last plan year that the plan was in reorganization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any amount paid by a plan during a plan year to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation pursuant to section 1402 of this title or to a fund exempt under section 501(c)(22) of title 26 pursuant to section 1403 of this title shall reduce the amount of contributions considered received by the plan for the plan year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Any amount paid by an employer pending a final determination of the employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III of this chapter and subsequently refunded to the employer by the plan shall be charged to the funding standard account in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) For purposes of the full funding limitation under subsection (c)(7) of this section, unless otherwise provided by the plan, the accrued liability under a multiemployer plan shall not include benefits which are not nonforfeitable under the plan after the termination of the plan (taking into consideration section 411(d)(3) of title 26).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Methods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this part, normal costs, accrued liability, past service liabilities, and experience gains and losses shall be determined under the funding method used to determine costs under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of this part, the value of the plan's assets shall be determined on the basis of any reasonable actuarial method of valuation which takes into account fair market value and which is permitted under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this part, the value of a bond or other evidence of indebtedness which is not in default as to principal or interest may, at the election of the plan administrator, be determined on an amortized basis running from initial cost at purchase to par value at maturity or earliest call date. Any election under this subparagraph shall be made at such time and in such manner as the Secretary of the Treasury shall by regulations provide, shall apply to all such evidences of indebtedness, and may be revoked only with the consent of the Secretary of the Treasury. In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, this subparagraph shall not apply, but the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations provide that the value of any dedicated bond portfolio of such plan shall be determined by using the interest rate under subsection (b)(5) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, all costs, liabilities, rates of interest, and other factors under the plan shall be determined on the basis of actuarial assumptions and methods&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a plan other than a multiemployer plan, each of which is reasonable (taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations) or which, in the aggregate, result in a total contribution equivalent to that which would be determined if each such assumption and method were reasonable, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a multiemployer plan, which, in the aggregate, are reasonable (taking into account the experiences of the plan and reasonable expectations), and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which, in combination, offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a change in benefits under the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] or in other retirement benefits created under Federal or State law, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a change in the definition of the term &ldquo;wages&rdquo; under section 3121 of title 26, or a change in the amount of such wages taken into account under regulations prescribed for purposes of section 401(a)(5) of title 26,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">results in an increase or decrease in accrued liability under a plan, such increase or decrease shall be treated as an experience loss or gain.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:382 --><p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the funding method for a plan is changed, the new funding method shall become the funding method used to determine costs and liabilities under the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury. If the plan year for a plan is changed, the new plan year shall become the plan year for the plan only if the change is approved by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) <cap-smallcap>Approval required for certain changes in assumptions by certain single-employer plans subject to additional funding requirement.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;No actuarial assumption (other than the assumptions described in subsection (d)(7)(C) of this section) used to determine the current liability for a plan to which this subparagraph applies may be changed without the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Plans to which subparagraph applies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;This subparagraph shall apply to a plan only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the plan is a defined benefit plan (other than a multiemployer plan) to which subchapter III of this chapter applies;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) the change in assumptions (determined after taking into account any changes in interest rate and mortality table) results in a decrease in the unfunded current liability of the plan for the current plan year that exceeds $50,000,000, or that exceeds $5,000,000 and that is 5 percent or more of the current liability of the plan before such change.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If, as of the close of a plan year, a plan would (without regard to this paragraph) have an accumulated funding deficiency (determined without regard to the alternative minimum funding standard account permitted under section 1085 of this title) in excess of the full funding limitation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the funding standard account shall be credited with the amount of such excess, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the fair market value of the plan's assets, or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Waiver of requirements in event of business hardship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an employer, or in the case of a multi-employer plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan are unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) and if application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate, the Secretary of the Treasury may waive the requirements of section 1082(a) of this title for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard other than the portion thereof determined under section 1082(b)(2)(C) of this title. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not waive the minimum funding standard with respect to a plan for more than 3 of any 15 (5 of any 15 in the case of a multiemployer plan) consecutive plan years. The interest rate used for purposes of computing the amortization charge described in subsection (b)(2)(C) of this section for any plan year shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, the greater of (A) 150 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of such plan year), or (B) the rate of interest used under the plan in determining costs (including adjustments under section 1082(b)(5)(B) of this title), and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:395 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the rate determined under section 6621(b) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Matters considered in determining business hardship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the factors taken into account in determining temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) shall include (but shall not be limited to) whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the employer is operating at an economic loss,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Waived funding deficiency&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;waived funding deficiency&rdquo; means the portion of the minimum funding standard (determined without regard to subsection (b)(3)(C) of section 1082 of this title) for a plan year waived by the Secretary of the Treasury and not satisfied by employer contributions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Application must be submitted before date 21/2 months after close of year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, no waiver may be granted under this section with respect to any plan for any plan year unless an application therefor is submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury not later than the 15th day of the 3rd month beginning after the close of such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special rule if employer is member of controlled group</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, if an employer is a member of a controlled group, the temporary substantial business hardship requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as met only if such requirements are met&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with respect to such employer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to the controlled group of which such employer is a member (determined by treating all members of such group as a single employer).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if the Secretary of the Treasury determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Controlled group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m), or (<em>o</em>) of section 414 of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice of filing of application for waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting a waiver under this section, require each applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to such Secretary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such waiver to each employee organization representing employees covered by the affected plan, and each affected party (as defined in section 1301(a)(21) of this title) other than the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. Such notice shall include a description of the extent to which the plan is funded for benefits which are guaranteed under subchapter III of this chapter and for benefit liabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall consider any relevant information provided by a person to whom notice was given under paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinations by Secretary in granting extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The period of years required to amortize any unfunded liability (described in any clause of subsection (b)(2)(B) of section 1082 of this title) of any plan may be extended by the Secretary for a period of time (not in excess of 10 years) if he determines that such extension would carry out the purposes of this chapter and would provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries and if he determines that the failure to permit such extension would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) result in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a plan other than a multiemployer plan, the interest rate applicable for any plan year under any arrangement entered into by the Secretary in connection with an extension granted under this subsection shall be the greater of (A) 150 percent of the Federal mid-term rate (as in effect under section 1274 of title 26 for the 1st month of such plan year), or (B) the rate of interest used under the plan in determining costs. In the case of a multiemployer plan, such rate shall be the rate determined under section 6621(b) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amendment of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No amendment of the plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan shall be adopted if a waiver under section 1083(a) of this title or an extension of time under subsection (a) of this section is in effect with respect to the plan, or if a plan amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) of this title has been made at any time in the preceding 12 months (24 months in the case of a multiemployer plan). If a plan is amended in violation of the preceding sentence, any such waiver, or extension of time, shall not apply to any plan year ending on or after the date on which such amendment is adopted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any plan amendment which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary determines to be reasonable and which provides for only de minimis increases in the liabilities of the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) only repeals an amendment described in section 1082(c)(8) of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is required as a condition of qualification under part I of subchapter D, of chapter 1, of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice of filing of application for extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting an extension under this section, require each applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to such Secretary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such extension to each employee organization representing employees covered by the affected plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall consider any relevant information provided by a person to whom notice was given under paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Scope of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This part shall apply to any employee benefit plan described in section 1003(a) of this title (and not exempted under section 1003(b) of this title), other than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a plan which is unfunded and is maintained by an employer primarily for the purpose of providing deferred compensation for a select group of management or highly compensated employees; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any agreement described in section 736 of title 26, which provides payments to a retired partner or deceased partner or a deceased partner's successor in interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Securities or policies deemed to be included in plan assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of a plan which invests in any security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80a&ndash;1 et seq.], the assets of such plan shall be deemed to include such security but shall not, solely by reason of such investment, be deemed to include any assets of such investment company.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of a plan to which a guaranteed benefit policy is issued by an insurer, the assets of such plan shall be deemed to include such policy, but shall not, solely by reason of the issuance of such policy, be deemed to include any assets of such insurer. For purposes of this paragraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The term &ldquo;insurer&rdquo; means an insurance company, insurance service, or insurance organization, qualified to do business in a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The term &ldquo;guaranteed benefit policy&rdquo; means an insurance policy or contract to the extent that such policy or contract provides for benefits the amount of which is guaranteed by the insurer. Such term includes any surplus in a separate account, but excludes any other portion of a separate account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Clarification of application of ERISA to insurance company general accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Not later than June 30, 1997, the Secretary shall issue proposed regulations to provide guidance for the purpose of determining, in cases where an insurer issues 1 or more policies to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan (and such policies are supported by assets of such insurer's general account), which assets held by the insurer (other than plan assets held in its separate accounts) constitute assets of the plan for purposes of this part and section 4975 of title 26 and to provide guidance with respect to the application of this subchapter to the general account assets of insurers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The proposed regulations under subparagraph (A) shall be subject to public notice and comment until September 30, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall issue final regulations providing the guidance described in subparagraph (A) not later than December 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Such regulations shall only apply with respect to policies which are issued by an insurer on or before December 31, 1998, to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan which is supported by assets of such insurer's general account. With respect to policies issued on or before December 31, 1998, such regulations shall take effect at the end of the 18-month period following the date on which such regulations become final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall ensure that the regulations issued under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are administratively feasible, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) protect the interests and rights of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries (including meeting the requirements of paragraph (3)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The regulations prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) shall require, in connection with any policy issued by an insurer to or for the benefit of an employee benefit plan to the extent that the policy is not a guaranteed benefit policy (as defined in subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that a plan fiduciary totally independent of the insurer authorize the purchase of such policy (unless such purchase is a transaction exempt under section 1108(b)(5) of this title),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that the insurer describe (in such form and manner as shall be prescribed in such regulations), in annual reports and in policies issued to the policyholder after the date on which such regulations are issued in final form pursuant to paragraph (1)(C)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a description of the method by which any income and expenses of the insurer's general account are allocated to the policy during the term of the policy and upon the termination of the policy, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for each report, the actual return to the plan under the policy and such other financial information as the Secretary may deem appropriate for the period covered by each such annual report,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that the insurer disclose to the plan fiduciary the extent to which alternative arrangements supported by assets of separate accounts of the insurer (which generally hold plan assets) are available, whether there is a right under the policy to transfer funds to a separate account and the terms governing any such right, and the extent to which support by assets of the insurer's general account and support by assets of separate accounts of the insurer might pose differing risks to the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that the insurer manage those assets of the insurer which are assets of such insurer's general account (irrespective of whether any such assets are plan assets) with the care, <!-- PDFPage:401 -->skill, prudence, and diligence under the circumstances then prevailing that a prudent man acting in a like capacity and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a like character and with like aims, taking into account all obligations supported by such enterprise.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Compliance by the insurer with all requirements of the regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be deemed compliance by such insurer with sections 1104, 1106, and 1107 of this title with respect to those assets of the insurer's general account which support a policy described in paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), any regulations issued under paragraph (1) shall not take effect before the date on which such regulations become final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No person shall be subject to liability under this part or section 4975 of title 26 for conduct which occurred before the date which is 18 months following the date described in subparagraph (A) on the basis of a claim that the assets of an insurer (other than plan assets held in a separate account) constitute assets of the plan, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as otherwise provided by the Secretary in regulations intended to prevent avoidance of the regulations issued under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) as provided in an action brought by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (2) or (5) of section 1132(a) of this title for a breach of fiduciary responsibilities which would also constitute a violation of Federal or State criminal law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall bring a cause of action described in clause (ii) if a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a breach described in clause (ii) has occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the application of any Federal criminal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;policy&rdquo; includes a contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Circumstances giving rise to liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to any liability which he may have under any other provisions of this part, a fiduciary with respect to a plan shall be liable for a breach of fiduciary responsibility of another fiduciary with respect to the same plan in the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if he participates knowingly in, or knowingly undertakes to conceal, an act or omission of such other fiduciary, knowing such act or omission is a breach;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if, by his failure to comply with section 1104(a)(1) of this title in the administration of his specific responsibilities which give rise to his status as a fiduciary, he has enabled such other fiduciary to commit a breach; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if he has knowledge of a breach by such other fiduciary, unless he makes reasonable efforts under the circumstances to remedy the breach.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assets held by two or more trustees</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) they shall jointly manage and control the assets of the plan, except that nothing in this subparagraph (B) shall preclude any agreement, authorized by the trust instrument, allocating specific responsibilities, obligations, or duties among trustees, in which event a trustee to whom certain responsibilities, obligations, or duties have not been allocated shall not be liable by reason of this subparagraph (B) either individually or as a trustee for any loss resulting to the plan arising from the acts or omissions on the part of another trustee to whom such responsibilities, obligations, or duties have been allocated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall limit any liability that a fiduciary may have under subsection (a) of this section or any other provision of this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of a plan the assets of which are held in more than one trust, a trustee shall not be liable under paragraph (1) except with respect to an act or omission of a trustee of a trust of which he is a trustee.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:406 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) No trustee shall be liable under this subsection for following instructions referred to in section 1103(a)(1) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The instrument under which a plan is maintained may expressly provide for procedures (A) for allocating fiduciary responsibilities (other than trustee responsibilities) among named fiduciaries, and (B) for named fiduciaries to designate persons other than named fiduciaries to carry out fiduciary responsibilities (other than trustee responsibilities) under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a plan expressly provides for a procedure described in paragraph (1), and pursuant to such procedure any fiduciary responsibility of a named fiduciary is allocated to any person, or a person is designated to carry out any such responsibility, then such named fiduciary shall not be liable for an act or omission of such person in carrying out such responsibility except to the extent that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) with respect to the establishment or implementation of the procedure under paragraph (1), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in continuing the allocation or designation; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the named fiduciary would otherwise be liable in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;trustee responsibility&rdquo; means any responsibility provided in the plan's trust instrument (if any) to manage or control the assets of the plan, other than a power under the trust instrument of a named fiduciary to appoint an investment manager in accordance with section 1102(c)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Investment managers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an investment manager or managers have been appointed under section 1102(c)(3) of this title, then, notwithstanding subsections (a)(2) and (3) and subsection (b) of this section, no trustee shall be liable for the acts or omissions of such investment manager or managers, or be under an obligation to invest or otherwise manage any asset of the plan which is subject to the management of such investment manager.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grant of exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish an exemption procedure for purposes of this subsection. Pursuant to such procedure, he may grant a conditional or unconditional exemption of any fiduciary or transaction, or class of fiduciaries or transactions, from all or part of the restrictions imposed by sections 1106 and 1107(a) of this title. Action under this subsection may be taken only after consultation and coordination with the Secretary of the Treasury. An exemption granted under this section shall not relieve a fiduciary from any other applicable provision of this chapter. The Secretary may not grant an exemption under this subsection unless he finds that such exemption is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) administratively feasible,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the interests of the plan and of its participants and beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) protective of the rights of participants and beneficiaries of such plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before granting an exemption under this subsection from section 1106(a) or 1107(a) of this title, the Secretary shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the pendency of the exemption, shall require that adequate notice be given to interested persons, and shall afford interested persons opportunity to present views. The Secretary may not grant an exemption under this subsection from section 1106(b) of this title unless he affords an opportunity for a hearing and makes a determination on the record with respect to the findings required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enumeration of transactions exempted from section 1106 prohibitions</h4>

A loan made by a plan shall not fail to meet the requirements of the preceding sentence by reason of a loan repayment suspension described under section 414(u)(4) of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Contracting or making reasonable arrangements with a party in interest for office space, or legal, accounting, or other services necessary for the establishment or operation of the plan, if no more than reasonable compensation is paid therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A loan to an employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 1107(d)(6) of this title), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such loan is primarily for the benefit of participants and beneficiaries of the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such loan is at an interest rate which is not in excess of a reasonable rate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the plan gives collateral to a party in interest for such loan, such collateral may consist only of qualifying employer securities (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The investment of all or part of a plan's assets in deposits which bear a reasonable interest rate in a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan covers only employees of such bank or other institution and employees of affiliates of such bank or other institution, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such investment is expressly authorized by a provision of the plan or by a fiduciary (other than such bank or institution or affiliate thereof) who is expressly empowered by the plan to so instruct the trustee with respect to such investment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Any contract for life insurance, health insurance, or annuities with one or more in<!-- PDFPage:411 -->surers which are qualified to do business in a State, if the plan pays no more than adequate consideration, and if each such insurer or insurers is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the employer maintaining the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a party in interest which is wholly owned (directly or indirectly) by the employer maintaining the plan, or by any person which is a party in interest with respect to the plan, but only if the total premiums and annuity considerations written by such insurers for life insurance, health insurance, or annuities for all plans (and their employers) with respect to which such insurers are parties in interest (not including premiums or annuity considerations written by the employer maintaining the plan) do not exceed 5 percent of the total premiums and annuity considerations written for all lines of insurance in that year by such insurers (not including premiums or annuity considerations written by the employer maintaining the plan).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The providing of any ancillary service by a bank or similar financial institution supervised by the United States or a State, if such bank or other institution is a fiduciary of such plan, and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such bank or similar financial institution has adopted adequate internal safeguards which assure that the providing of such ancillary service is consistent with sound banking and financial practice, as determined by Federal or State supervisory authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which such ancillary service is provided is subject to specific guidelines issued by such bank or similar financial institution (as determined by the Secretary after consultation with Federal and State supervisory authority), and adherence to such guidelines would reasonably preclude such bank or similar financial institution from providing such ancillary service (i) in an excessive or unreasonable manner, and (ii) in a manner that would be inconsistent with the best interests of participants and beneficiaries of employee benefit plans.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Such ancillary services shall not be provided at more than reasonable compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The exercise of a privilege to convert securities, to the extent provided in regulations of the Secretary, but only if the plan receives no less than adequate consideration pursuant to such conversion.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the transaction is a sale or purchase of an interest in the fund,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the bank, trust company, or insurance company receives not more than reasonable compensation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such transaction is expressly permitted by the instrument under which the plan is maintained, or by a fiduciary (other than the bank, trust company, or insurance company, or an affiliate thereof) who has authority to manage and control the assets of the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The making by a fiduciary of a distribution of the assets of the plan in accordance with the terms of the plan if such assets are distributed in the same manner as provided under section 1344 of this title (relating to allocation of assets).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The sale by a plan to a party in interest on or after December 18, 1987, of any stock, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (e) of this section are met with respect to such stock,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the later of the date on which the stock was acquired by the plan, or January 1, 1975, such stock constituted a qualifying employer security (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title as then in effect), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such stock does not constitute a qualifying employer security (as defined in section 1107(d)(5) of this title as in effect at the time of the sale).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Any transfer made before January 1, 2006, of excess pension assets from a defined benefit plan to a retiree health account in a qualified transfer permitted under section 420 of title 26 (as in effect on December 17, 1999).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) receiving any benefit to which he may be entitled as a participant or beneficiary in the plan, so long as the benefit is computed and paid on a basis which is consistent with the terms of the plan as applied to all other participants and beneficiaries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) receiving any reasonable compensation for services rendered, or for the reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred, in the performance of his duties with the plan; except that no person so serving who already receives full time pay from an employer or an association of employers, whose employees are participants in the plan, or from an employee organization whose members are participants in such plan shall receive compensation from such plan, except for reimbursement of expenses properly and actually incurred; or</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1112. Bonding</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requisite bonding of plan officials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every fiduciary of an employee benefit plan and every person who handles funds or other property of such a plan (hereafter in this section referred to as &ldquo;plan official&rdquo;) shall be bonded as provided in this section; except that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:416 --><p class="statutory-body">(1) where such plan is one under which the only assets from which benefits are paid are the general assets of a union or of an employer, the administrator, officers, and employees of such plan shall be exempt from the bonding requirements of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) no bond shall be required of a fiduciary (or of any director, officer, or employee of such fiduciary) if such fiduciary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United States or of any State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is authorized under such laws to exercise trust powers or to conduct an insurance business;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is subject to supervision or examination by Federal or State authority; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) has at all times a combined capital and surplus in excess of such a minimum amount as may be established by regulations issued by the Secretary, which amount shall be at least $1,000,000. Paragraph (2) shall apply to a bank or other financial institution which is authorized to exercise trust powers and the deposits of which are not insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, only if such bank or institution meets bonding or similar requirements under State law which the Secretary determines are at least equivalent to those imposed on banks by Federal law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of such bond shall be fixed at the beginning of each fiscal year of the plan. Such amount shall be not less than 10 per centum of the amount of funds handled. In no case shall such bond be less than $1,000 nor more than $500,000, except that the Secretary, after due notice and opportunity for hearing to all interested parties, and after consideration of the record, may prescribe an amount in excess of $500,000, subject to the 10 per centum limitation of the preceding sentence. For purposes of fixing the amount of such bond, the amount of funds handled shall be determined by the funds handled by the person, group, or class to be covered by such bond and by their predecessor or predecessors, if any, during the preceding reporting year, or if the plan has no preceding reporting year, the amount of funds to be handled during the current reporting year by such person, group, or class, estimated as provided in regulations of the Secretary. Such bond shall provide protection to the plan against loss by reason of acts of fraud or dishonesty on the part of the plan official, directly or through connivance with others. Any bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to sections 9304&ndash;9308 of title 31. Any bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary, including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unlawful acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any plan official to whom subsection (a) of this section applies, to receive, handle, disburse, or otherwise exercise custody or control of any of the funds or other property of any employee benefit plan, without being bonded as required by subsection (a) of this section and it shall be unlawful for any plan official of such plan, or any other person having authority to direct the performance of such functions, to permit such functions, or any of them, to be performed by any plan official, with respect to whom the requirements of subsection (a) of this section have not been met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conflict of interest prohibited in procuring bonds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any person to procure any bond required by subsection (a) of this section from any surety or other company or through any agent or broker in whose business operations such plan or any party in interest in such plan has any control or significant financial interest, direct or indirect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exclusiveness of statutory basis for bonding requirement for persons handling funds or other property of employee benefit plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in any other provision of law shall require any person, required to be bonded as provided in subsection (a) of this section because he handles funds or other property of an employee benefit plan, to be bonded insofar as the handling by such person of the funds or other property of such plan is concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section including exempting a plan from the requirements of this section where he finds that (1) other bonding arrangements or (2) the overall financial condition of the plan would be adequate to protect the interests of the beneficiaries and participants. When, in the opinion of the Secretary, the administrator of a plan offers adequate evidence of the financial responsibility of the plan, or that other bonding arrangements would provide adequate protection of the beneficiaries and participants, he may exempt such plan from the requirements of this section.</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, each violation described in subparagraph (A) with respect to any single participant, and each violation described in subparagraph (B) with respect to any single participant or beneficiary, shall be treated as a separate violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may assess a civil penalty against any plan administrator of up to $1,000 a day from the date of such plan administrator's failure or refusal to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under section 1021(b)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1132_2_target" name="1132_2">2</a></sup> of this title.

No penalty shall be imposed under this paragraph for any failure resulting from matters reasonably beyond the control of the plan administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary and the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall maintain such ongoing consultation as may be necessary and appropriate to coordinate enforcement under this subsection with enforcement under section 1320b&ndash;14(c)(8)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1132_2_target" name="1132_2">2</a></sup> of title 42.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) An employee benefit plan may sue or be sued under this subchapter as an entity.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Amount in controversy; citizenship of parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, without respect to the <!-- PDFPage:420 -->amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to grant the relief provided for in subsection (a) of this section in any action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A copy of the complaint in any action under this subchapter by a participant, beneficiary, or fiduciary (other than an action brought by one or more participants or beneficiaries under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section which is solely for the purpose of recovering benefits due such participants under the terms of the plan) shall be served upon the Secretary and the Secretary of the Treasury by certified mail.

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining the status of a church plan that is a welfare plan under provisions of a State insurance law described in subsection (b) of this section, such a church plan (and any trust under such plan) shall be deemed to be a plan sponsored by a single employer that reimburses costs from general church assets, or purchases insurance coverage with general church assets, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State insurance law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State insurance law described in this subsection is a law that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Welfare plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;welfare plan&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) means any church plan to the extent that such plan provides medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprenticeship or other training programs, or day care centers, scholarship funds, or prepaid legal services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not include any entity, such as a health insurance issuer described in section 9832(b)(2) of title 26 or a health maintenance organization described in section 9832(b)(3) of title 26, or any other organization that does business with the church plan or organization sponsoring or maintaining such a plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, for purposes of enforcing provisions of State insurance laws that apply to a church plan that is a welfare plan, the church plan shall be subject to State enforcement as if the church plan were an insurer licensed by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, the application of this section is limited to determining the status of a church plan that is a welfare plan under the provisions of State insurance laws described in subsection (b) of this section. This section shall not otherwise be construed to recharacterize the status, or modify or affect the rights, of any plan participant or beneficiary, including participants or beneficiaries who make plan contributions.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A leading obstacle to expanding retirement savings is the simple fact that far too many Americans&mdash;particularly the young&mdash;are either unaware of, or without the knowledge and resources necessary to take advantage of, the extensive benefits offered by our retirement savings system.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provides for child support with respect to a child of a participant under a group health plan or provides for health benefit coverage to such a child, is made pursuant to a State domestic relations law (including a community property law), and relates to benefits under such plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is made pursuant to a law relating to medical child support described in section 1908 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396g&ndash;1] (as added by section 13822&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1169_1_target" name="1169_1">1</a></sup> of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993) with respect to a group health plan,</p>

For purposes of this subparagraph, an administrative notice which is issued pursuant to an administrative process referred to in subclause (II) of the preceding sentence and which has the effect of an order described in clause (i) or (ii) of the preceding sentence shall be treated as such an order.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Alternate recipient</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the period to which such order applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Restriction on new types or forms of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A medical child support order meets the requirements of this paragraph only if such <!-- PDFPage:443 -->order does not require a plan to provide any type or form of benefit, or any option, not otherwise provided under the plan, except to the extent necessary to meet the requirements of a law relating to medical child support described in section 1908 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396g&ndash;1] (as added by section 13822&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1169_1_target" name="1169_1">1</a></sup> of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Establishment of procedures for determining qualified status of orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each group health plan shall establish reasonable procedures to determine whether medical child support orders are qualified medical child support orders and to administer the provision of benefits under such qualified orders. Such procedures&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall provide for the notification of each person specified in a medical child support order as eligible to receive benefits under the plan (at the address included in the medical child support order) of such procedures promptly upon receipt by the plan of the medical child support order, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall permit an alternate recipient to designate a representative for receipt of copies of notices that are sent to the alternate recipient with respect to a medical child support order.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Enrollment of child in plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which an appropriately completed National Medical Support Notice is issued in the case of a child of a participant under a group health plan who is a noncustodial parent of the child, and the Notice is deemed under clause (i) to be a qualified medical child support order, the plan administrator, within 40 business days after the date of the Notice, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) notify the State agency issuing the Notice with respect to such child whether coverage of the child is available under the terms of the plan and, if so, whether such child is covered under the plan and either the effective date of the coverage or, if necessary, any steps to be taken by the custodial parent (or by the official of a State or political subdivision thereof substituted for the name of such child pursuant to paragraph (3)(A)) to effectuate the coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) provide to the custodial parent (or such substituted official) a description of the coverage available and any forms or documents necessary to effectuate such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as requiring a group health plan, upon receipt of a National Medical Support Notice, to provide benefits under the plan (or eligibility for such benefits) in addition to benefits (or eligibility for benefits) provided under the terms of the plan as of immediately before receipt of such Notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Actions taken by fiduciaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in treating a medical child support order as being (or not being) a qualified medical child support order, then the plan's obligation to the participant and each alternate recipient shall be discharged to the extent of any payment made pursuant to such act of the fiduciary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Treatment of alternate recipients</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Treatment as beneficiary generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A person who is an alternate recipient under a qualified medical child support order shall be considered a beneficiary under the plan for purposes of any provision of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Direct provision of benefits provided to alternate recipients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any payment for benefits made by a group health plan pursuant to a medical child support order in reimbursement for expenses paid by an alternate recipient or an alternate recipient's custodial parent or legal guardian shall be made to the alternate recipient or the alternate recipient's custodial parent or legal guardian.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:444 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Payment to State official treated as satisfaction of plan's obligation to make payment to alternate recipient</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payment of benefits by a group health plan to an official of a State or a political subdivision thereof whose name and address have been substituted for the address of an alternate recipient in a qualified medical child support order, pursuant to paragraph (3)(A), shall be treated, for purposes of this subchapter, as payment of benefits to the alternate recipient.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Compliance by plans with assignment of rights</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Enrollment and provision of benefits without regard to medicaid eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan shall provide that, in enrolling an individual as a participant or beneficiary or in determining or making any payments for benefits of an individual as a participant or beneficiary, the fact that the individual is eligible for or is provided medical assistance under a State plan for medical assistance approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] will not be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Acquisition by States of rights of third parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan shall provide that, to the extent that payment has been made under a State plan for medical assistance approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] in any case in which a group health plan has a legal liability to make payment for items or services constituting such assistance, payment for benefits under the plan will be made in accordance with any State law which provides that the State has acquired the rights with respect to a participant to such payment for such items or services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Group health plan coverage of dependent children in cases of adoption</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Coverage effective upon placement for adoption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which a group health plan provides coverage for dependent children of participants or beneficiaries, such plan shall provide benefits to dependent children placed with participants or beneficiaries for adoption under the same terms and conditions as apply in the case of dependent children who are natural children of participants or beneficiaries under the plan, irrespective of whether the adoption has become final.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Restrictions based on preexisting conditions at time of placement for adoption prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan may not restrict coverage under the plan of any dependent child adopted by a participant or beneficiary, or placed with a participant or beneficiary for adoption, solely on the basis of a preexisting condition of such child at the time that such child would otherwise become eligible for coverage under the plan, if the adoption or placement for adoption occurs while the participant or beneficiary is eligible for coverage under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Child</h4>

The child's placement with such person terminates upon the termination of such legal obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Continued coverage of costs of a pediatric vaccine under group health plans</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not include any aggregate lifetime limit on mental health benefits that is less than the applicable lifetime limit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Rule in case of different limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan or coverage that is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and that includes no or different aggregate lifetime limits on different categories of medical and surgical benefits, the Secretary shall establish rules under which subparagraph (B) is applied to such plan or coverage with respect to mental health benefits by substituting for the applicable lifetime limit an aver<!-- PDFPage:454 -->age aggregate lifetime limit that is computed taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime limits applicable to such categories.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health benefits&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Employers not in existence in preceding year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of an employer which was not in existence throughout the preceding calendar year, the determination of whether such employer is a small employer shall be based on the average number of employees that it is reasonably expected such employer will employ on business days in the current calendar year.</p>
