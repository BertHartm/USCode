<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rules governing single-employer plan terminations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exclusive means of plan termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except in the case of a termination for which proceedings are otherwise instituted by the corporation as provided in section 1342 of this title, a single-employer plan may be terminated only in a standard termination under subsection (b) of this section or a distress termination under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 60-day notice of intent to terminate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not less than 60 days before the proposed termination date of a standard termination under subsection (b) of this section or a distress termination under subsection (c) of this section, the plan administrator shall provide to each affected party (other than the corporation in the case of a standard termination) a written notice of intent to terminate stating that such termination is intended and the proposed termination date. The written notice shall include any related additional information required in regulations of the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adherence to collective bargaining agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The corporation shall not proceed with a termination of a plan under this section if the termination would violate the terms and conditions of an existing collective bargaining agreement. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed as limiting the authority of the corporation to institute proceedings to involuntarily terminate a plan under section 1342 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standard termination of single-employer plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A single-employer plan may terminate under a standard termination only if&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:507 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan administrator provides the 60-day advance notice of intent to terminate to affected parties required under subsection (a)(2) of this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) are met,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the corporation does not issue a notice of noncompliance under subparagraph (C) of paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) when the final distribution of assets occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Notice to the corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As soon as practicable after the date on which the notice of intent to terminate is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation setting forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) certification by an enrolled actuary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) of the projected amount of the assets of the plan (as of a proposed date of final distribution of assets),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) of the actuarial present value (as of such date) of the benefit liabilities (determined as of the proposed termination date) under the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) that the plan is projected to be sufficient (as of such proposed date of final distribution) for such benefit liabilities,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) such information as the corporation may prescribe in regulations as necessary to enable the corporation to make determinations under subparagraph (C), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) certification by the plan administrator that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the information on which the enrolled actuary based the certification under clause (i) is accurate and complete, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the information provided to the corporation under clause (ii) is accurate and complete.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Clause (i) and clause (iii)(I) shall not apply to a plan described in section 412(i) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice to participants and beneficiaries of benefit commitments&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1341_1_target" name="1341_1">1</a></sup></h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No later than the date on which a notice is sent by the plan administrator under subparagraph (A), the plan administrator shall send a notice to each person who is a participant or beneficiary under the plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) specifying the amount of the benefit liabilities (if any) attributable to such person as of the proposed termination date and the benefit form on the basis of which such amount is determined, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) including the following information used in determining such benefit liabilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the length of service,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) wages,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the assumptions, including the interest rate, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) such other information as the corporation may require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Such notice shall be written in such manner as is likely to be understood by the participant or beneficiary and as may be prescribed in regulations of the corporation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Notice from the corporation of noncompliance</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Within 60 days after receipt of the notice under subparagraph (A), the corporation shall issue a notice of noncompliance to the plan administrator if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) it determines, based on the notice sent under paragraph (2)(A) of subsection (b) of this section, that there is reason to believe that the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) it otherwise determines, on the basis of information provided by affected parties or otherwise obtained by the corporation, that there is reason to believe that the plan is not sufficient for benefit liabilities, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) it determines that any other requirement of subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph or of subsection (a)(2) of this section has not been met, unless it further determines that the issuance of such notice would be inconsistent with the interests of participants and beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The corporation and the plan administrator may agree to extend the 60-day period referred to in clause (i) by a written agreement signed by the corporation and the plan administrator before the expiration of the 60-day period. The 60-day period shall be extended as provided in the agreement and may be further extended by subsequent written agreements signed by the corporation and the plan administrator made before the expiration of a previously agreed upon extension of the 60-day period. Any extension may be made upon such terms and conditions (including the payment of benefits) as are agreed upon by the corporation and the plan administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Final distribution of assets in absence of notice of noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The plan administrator shall commence the final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan as soon as practicable after the expiration of the 60-day (or extended) period referred to in subparagraph (C), but such final distribution may occur only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the plan administrator has not received during such period a notice of noncompliance from the corporation under subparagraph (C), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) when such final distribution occurs, the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (determined as of the termination date).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:508 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Methods of final distribution of assets</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In connection with any final distribution of assets pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall distribute the assets in accordance with section 1344 of this title. In distributing such assets, the plan administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) purchase irrevocable commitments from an insurer to provide all benefit liabilities under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in accordance with the provisions of the plan and any applicable regulations, otherwise fully provide all benefit liabilities under the plan. A transfer of assets to the corporation in accordance with section 1350 of this title on behalf of a missing participant shall satisfy this subparagraph with respect to such participant.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification to the corporation of final distribution of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 30 days after the final distribution of assets is completed pursuant to the standard termination of the plan under this subsection, the plan administrator shall send a notice to the corporation certifying that the assets of the plan have been distributed in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (A) so as to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Continuing authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the continued exercise by the corporation, after the termination date of a plan terminated in a standard termination under this subsection, of its authority under section 1303 of this title with respect to matters relating to the termination. A certification under paragraph (3)(B) shall not affect the corporation's obligations under section 1322 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Distress termination of single-employer plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A single-employer plan may terminate under a distress termination only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the plan administrator provides the 60-day advance notice of intent to terminate to affected parties required under subsection (a)(2) of this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the requirements of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (2) are met, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the corporation determines that the requirements of subparagraph (B) of paragraph (2) are met.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination requirements</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Information submitted to the corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As soon as practicable after the date on which the notice of intent to terminate is provided pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, the plan administrator shall provide the corporation, in such form as may be prescribed by the corporation in regulations, the following information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such information as the corporation may prescribe by regulation as necessary to make determinations under subparagraph (B) and paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) unless the corporation determines the information is not necessary for purposes of paragraph (3)(A) or section 1362 of this title, certification by an enrolled actuary of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the amount (as of the proposed termination date and, if applicable, the proposed distribution date) of the current value of the assets of the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the actuarial present value (as of such dates) of the benefit liabilities under the plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) whether the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities as of such dates,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) whether the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits as of such dates;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the name and address of each participant and beneficiary under the plan as of such date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such other information as shall be prescribed by the corporation by regulation as necessary to enable the corporation to be able to make payments to participants and beneficiaries as required under section 1322(c) of this title; and</p>

The requirements of this subparagraph are met if each person who is (as of the proposed termination date) a contributing sponsor of such plan or a member of such sponsor's controlled group meets the requirements of any of the following clauses:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Liquidation in bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The requirements of this clause are met by a person if&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Termination required to enable payment of debts while staying in business or to avoid unreasonably burdensome pension costs caused by declining workforce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The requirements of this clause are met by a person if such person demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the costs of providing pension coverage have become unreasonably burdensome to such person, solely as a result of a decline of such person's workforce covered as participants under all single-employer plans of which such person is a contributing sponsor.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The corporation shall notify the plan administrator as soon as practicable of its determinations made pursuant to subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination procedure</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determinations by the corporation relating to plan sufficiency for guaranteed benefits and for benefit liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the corporation determines that the requirements for a distress termination set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) are met, the corporation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities (as of the termination date) or that the corporation is unable to make such determination on the basis of information made available to the corporation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) notify the plan administrator of the determinations made pursuant to this subparagraph as soon as practicable.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Implementation of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">After the corporation notifies the plan administrator of its determinations under subparagraph (A), the termination of the plan shall be carried out as soon as practicable, as provided in clause (i), (ii), or (iii).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Cases of sufficiency for benefit liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan's assets, and make certification to the corporation with respect to such distribution, in the manner described in subsection (b)(3) of this section, and shall take such other actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Cases of sufficiency for guaranteed benefits without a finding of sufficiency for benefit liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which the corporation determines that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits, but further determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities on the basis of the information made available to it, the plan administrator shall proceed to distribute the plan's assets in the manner described in subsection (b)(3) of this section, make certification to the corporation that the distribution has occurred, and take such actions as may be appropriate to carry out the termination of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Cases without any finding of sufficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which the corporation determines that it is unable to determine that the plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits on the basis of the information made available to it, the corporation shall commence proceedings in accordance with section 1342 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Finding after authorized commencement of termination that plan is unable to pay benefits</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Finding with respect to benefit liabilities which are not guaranteed benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized <!-- PDFPage:510 -->under subparagraph (B)(i), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay benefit liabilities which are not benefits guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title, the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Finding with respect to guaranteed benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If, after the plan administrator has begun to terminate the plan as authorized by subparagraph (B)(i) or (ii), the plan administrator finds that the plan is unable, or will be unable, to pay all benefits under the plan which are guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title, the plan administrator shall notify the corporation of such finding as soon as practicable thereafter. If the corporation concurs in the finding of the plan administrator (or the corporation itself makes such a finding), the corporation shall institute appropriate proceedings under section 1342 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Administration of the plan during interim period</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The plan administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) meet the requirements of clause (ii) for the period commencing on the date on which the plan administrator provides a notice of distress termination to the corporation under subsection (a)(2) of this section and ending on the date on which the plan administrator receives notification from the corporation of its determinations under subparagraph (A), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) meet the requirements of clause (ii) commencing on the date on which the plan administrator or the corporation makes a finding under subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The requirements of this clause are met by the plan administrator if the plan administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) refrains from distributing assets or taking any other actions to carry out the proposed termination under this subsection,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) pays benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) does not use plan assets to purchase irrevocable commitments to provide benefits from an insurer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) continues to pay all benefit liabilities under the plan, but, commencing on the proposed termination date, limits the payment of benefits under the plan to those benefits which are guaranteed by the corporation under section 1322 of this title or to which assets are required to be allocated under section 1344 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;In the event the plan administrator is later determined not to have met the requirements for distress termination, any benefits which are not paid solely by reason of compliance with subclause (IV) shall be due and payable immediately (together with interest, at a reasonable rate, in accordance with regulations of the corporation).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Sufficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sufficiency for benefit liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A single-employer plan is sufficient for benefit liabilities if there is no amount of unfunded benefit liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sufficiency for guaranteed benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A single-employer plan is sufficient for guaranteed benefits if there is no amount of unfunded guaranteed benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on the conversion of a defined benefit plan to a defined contribution plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The adoption of an amendment to a plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title constitutes a termination of the plan. Such an amendment may take effect only after the plan satisfies the requirements for standard termination under subsection (b) of this section or distress termination under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1341a. Termination of multiemployer plans</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determinative factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Termination of a multiemployer plan under this section occurs as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the adoption after September 26, 1980, of a plan amendment which provides that participants will receive no credit for any purpose under the plan for service with any employer after the date specified by such amendment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the withdrawal of every employer from the plan, within the meaning of section 1383 of this title, or the cessation of the obligation of all employers to contribute under the plan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the adoption of an amendment to the plan which causes the plan to become a plan described in section 1321(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Date of termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section is the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the amendment is adopted, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which the amendment takes effect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The date on which a plan terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section is the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date on which the last employer withdraws, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day of the first plan year for which no employer contributions were required under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duties of plan sponsor of amended plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (f)(1) of this section, the plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) limit the payment of benefits to benefits which are nonforfeitable under the plan as of the date of the termination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pay benefits attributable to employer contributions, other than death benefits, only in the form of an annuity, unless the plan assets are distributed in full satisfaction of all nonforfeitable benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Duties of plan sponsor of nonoperative plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan sponsor of a plan which terminates under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) of this section shall reduce benefits and suspend benefit payments in accordance with section 1441 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of contribution of employer under amended plan for each plan year subsequent to plan termination date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a plan which terminates under paragraph (1) or (3) of subsection (a) of this section, the rate of an employer's contributions under the plan for each plan year beginning on or after the plan termination date shall equal or exceed the highest rate of employer contributions at which the employer had an obligation to contribute under the plan in the 5 preceding plan years ending on or before the plan termination date, unless the corporation approves a reduction in the rate based on a finding that the plan is or soon will be fully funded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of benefits; reporting requirements for terminated plans and rules and standards for administration of such plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The plan sponsor of a terminated plan may authorize the payment other than in the form of an annuity of a participant's entire nonforfeitable benefit attributable to employer contributions, other than a death benefit, if the value of the entire nonforfeitable benefit does not exceed $1,750. The corporation may authorize the payment of benefits under the terms of a terminated plan other than nonforfeitable benefits, or the payment other than in the form of an annuity of benefits having a value greater than $1,750, if the corporation determines that such payment is not adverse to the interest of the plan's participants and beneficiaries generally and does not unreasonably increase the corporation's risk of loss with respect to the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The corporation may prescribe reporting requirements for terminated plans, and rules and standards for the administration of such plans, which the corporation considers appropriate to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries or to prevent unreasonable loss to the corporation.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1342. Institution of termination proceedings by the corporation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to institute proceedings to terminate a plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation may institute proceedings under this section to terminate a plan whenever it determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the plan has not met the minimum funding standard required under section 412 of title 26, or has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that a notice of deficiency under section 6212 of title 26 has been mailed with respect to the tax imposed under section 4971(a) of title 26,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the plan will be unable to pay benefits when due,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the reportable event described in section 1343(c)(7) of this title has occurred, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the possible long-run loss of the corporation with respect to the plan may reasonably be expected to increase unreasonably if the plan is not terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The corporation shall as soon as practicable institute proceedings under this section to terminate a single-employer plan whenever the corporation determines that the plan does not have assets available to pay benefits which are currently due under the terms of the plan. The corporation may prescribe a simplified procedure to follow in terminating small plans as long as that procedure includes substantial safeguards for the rights of the participants and beneficiaries under the plans, and for the employers who maintain such plans (including the requirement for a court decree under subsection (c) of this section). Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the corporation is authorized to pool assets of terminated plans for purposes of administration, investment, payment of liabilities of all such terminated plans, and such other purposes as it determines to be appropriate in the administration of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointment of trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever the corporation makes a determination under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a plan or is required under subsection (a) of this section to institute proceedings under this section, it may, upon notice to the plan, apply to the appropriate United States district court for the appointment of a trustee to administer the plan with respect to which the determination is made pending the issuance of a decree under subsection (c) of this section ordering the termination of the plan. If within 3 business days after the filing of an application under this subsection, or such other period as the court may order, the administrator of the plan consents to the appointment of a trustee, or fails to show why a trustee should not be appointed, the court may grant the application and appoint a trustee to administer the plan in accordance with its terms until the corporation determines that the plan should be terminated or that termination is unnecessary. The corporation may request that it be appointed as trustee of a plan in any case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) upon the petition of a plan administrator or the corporation, the appropriate United States district court may appoint a trustee in accordance with the provisions of this section if the interests of the plan participants would be better served by the appointment of the trustee, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) upon the petition of the corporation, the appropriate United States district court shall appoint a trustee proposed by the corporation for a multiemployer plan which is in reorganization or to which section 1341a(d) of this title applies, unless such appointment would be adverse to the interests of the plan participants and beneficiaries in the aggregate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The corporation and plan administrator may agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjudication that plan must be terminated</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation is required under subsection (a) of this section to commence proceedings under this section with respect to a plan or, after issuing a notice under this section to a plan administrator, has determined that the plan should be terminated, it may, upon notice to the plan administrator, apply to the appropriate United States district court for a decree adjudicating that the plan must be terminated in order to protect the interests of the participants or to avoid any unreasonable deterioration of the financial condition of the plan or any unreasonable increase in the liability of the fund. If the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section disagrees with the determination of the corporation under the preceding sentence he may intervene in the proceeding relating to the application for the decree, or make application for such decree himself. Upon granting a decree for which the corporation or trustee has applied under this subsection the court shall authorize the trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section (or appoint a trustee if one has not been appointed under such subsection and authorize him) to terminate the plan in accordance with the provisions of this subtitle. If the corporation and the plan administrator agree that a plan should be terminated and agree to the appointment of a trustee without proceeding in accordance with the requirements of this subsection (other than this sentence) the trustee shall have the power described in subsection (d)(1) of this section and, in addition to any other duties imposed on the trustee under law or by agreement between the corporation and the plan administrator, the trustee is subject to the duties described in subsection (d)(3) of this section. Whenever a trustee appointed under this subchapter is operating a <!-- PDFPage:516 -->plan with discretion as to the date upon which final distribution of the assets is to be commenced, the trustee shall notify the corporation at least 10 days before the date on which he proposes to commence such distribution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1342_1_target" name="1342_1">1</a></sup> In the case of a proceeding initiated under this section, the plan administrator shall provide the corporation, upon the request of the corporation, the information described in clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv) of section 1341(c)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Powers of trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) A trustee appointed under subsection (b) of this section shall have the power&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to do any act authorized by the plan or this subchapter to be done by the plan administrator or any trustee of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to require the transfer of all (or any part) of the assets and records of the plan to himself as trustee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to invest any assets of the plan which he holds in accordance with the provisions of the plan, regulations of the corporation, and applicable rules of law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) to limit payment of benefits under the plan to basic benefits or to continue payment of some or all of the benefits which were being paid prior to his appointment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) in the case of a multiemployer plan, to reduce benefits or suspend benefit payments under the plan, give appropriate notices, amend the plan, and perform other acts required or authorized by subtitle (E) of this subchapter to be performed by the plan sponsor or administrator;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) to do such other acts as he deems necessary to continue operation of the plan without increasing the potential liability of the corporation, if such acts may be done under the provisions of the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) to require the plan sponsor, the plan administrator, any contributing or withdrawn employer, and any employee organization representing plan participants to furnish any information with respect to the plan which the trustee may reasonably need in order to administer the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the court to which application is made under subsection (c) of this section dismisses the application with prejudice, or if the corporation fails to apply for a decree under subsection (c) of this section, within 30 days after the date on which the trustee is appointed under subsection (b) of this section, the trustee shall transfer all assets and records of the plan held by him to the plan administrator within 3 business days after such dismissal or the expiration of such 30-day period, and shall not be liable to the plan or any other person for his acts as trustee except for willful misconduct, or for conduct in violation of the provisions of part 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter (except as provided in subsection (d)(1)(A)(v) of this section). The 30-day period referred to in this subparagraph may be extended as provided by agreement between the plan administrator and the corporation or by court order obtained by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the court to which an application is made under subsection (c) of this section issues the decree requested in such application, in addition to the powers described in subparagraph (A), the trustee shall have the power&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to pay benefits under the plan in accordance with the requirements of this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to collect for the plan any amounts due the plan, including but not limited to the power to collect from the persons obligated to meet the requirements of section 1082 of this title or the terms of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) to receive any payment made by the corporation to the plan under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) to commence, prosecute, or defend on behalf of the plan any suit or proceeding involving the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) to issue, publish, or file such notices, statements, and reports as may be required by the corporation or any order of the court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) to liquidate the plan assets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) to recover payments under section 1345(a) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) to do such other acts as may be necessary to comply with this subchapter or any order of the court and to protect the interests of plan participants and beneficiaries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable after his appointment, the trustee shall give notice to interested parties of the institution of proceedings under this subchapter to determine whether the plan should be terminated or to terminate the plan, whichever is applicable. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;interested party&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the plan administrator,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) each participant in the plan and each beneficiary of a deceased participant,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) each employer who may be subject to liability under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) each employer who is or may be liable to the plan under section&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1342_2_target" name="1342_2">2</a></sup> part 1 of subtitle E of this subchapter,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) each employer who has an obligation to contribute, within the meaning of section 1392(a) of this title, under a multiemployer plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) each employee organization which, for purposes of collective bargaining, represents plan participants employed by an employer described in subparagraph (C), (D), or (E).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, or as may be otherwise ordered by the court, a trustee appointed under this section shall be subject to the same duties as those of a trustee under section 704 of title 11, and shall be, with respect to the plan, a fiduciary within the meaning of paragraph (21) of section 1002 of this title and under section 4975(e) of title 26 (except to the extent that the provisions of this subchapter are inconsistent with the requirements applicable under part 4 of subtitle B of subchapter I of this chapter and of such section 4975).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Filing of application notwithstanding pendency of other proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An application by the corporation under this section may be filed notwithstanding the pendency in the same or any other court of any <!-- PDFPage:517 -->bankruptcy, mortgage foreclosure, or equity receivership proceeding, or any proceeding to reorganize, conserve, or liquidate such plan or its property, or any proceeding to enforce a lien against property of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exclusive jurisdiction; stay of other proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of an application for the appointment of a trustee or the issuance of a decree under this section, the court to which an application is made shall have exclusive jurisdiction of the plan involved and its property wherever located with the powers, to the extent consistent with the purposes of this section, of a court of the United States having jurisdiction over cases under chapter 11 of title 11. Pending an adjudication under subsection (c) of this section such court shall stay, and upon appointment by it of a trustee, as provided in this section such court shall continue the stay of, any pending mortgage foreclosure, equity receivership, or other proceeding to reorganize, conserve, or liquidate the plan or its property and any other suit against any receiver, conservator, or trustee of the plan or its property. Pending such adjudication and upon the appointment by it of such trustee, the court may stay any proceeding to enforce a lien against property of the plan or any other suit against the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An action under this subsection may be brought in the judicial district where the plan administrator resides or does business or where any asset of the plan is situated. A district court in which such action is brought may issue process with respect to such action in any other judicial district.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Compensation of trustee and professional service personnel appointed or retained by trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of compensation paid to each trustee appointed under the provisions of this subchapter shall require the prior approval of the corporation, and, in the case of a trustee appointed by a court, the consent of that court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) This paragraph applies if the assets available for allocation under paragraph (5) of subsection (a) of this section are not sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in that paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) If the assets available for allocation under subparagraph (A) are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits described in such subparagraph (without regard to this subparagraph), then for purposes of subparagraph (A), benefits of individuals described in such subparagraph shall be determined on the basis of the plan as amended by the most recent plan amendment effective during such 5-year period under which the assets available for allocation are sufficient to satisfy in full the benefits of individuals described in subparagraph (A) and any assets remaining to be allocated under such subparagraph shall be allocated under subparagraph (A) on the basis of the plan as amended by the next succeeding plan amendment effective during such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the allocation made pursuant to this section (without regard to this paragraph) results in discrimination prohibited by section 401(a)(4) of title 26 then, if required to prevent the disqualification of the plan (or any trust <!-- PDFPage:521 -->under the plan) under section 401(a) or 403(a) of title 26, the assets allocated under subsections (a)(4)(B), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of this section shall be reallocated to the extent necessary to avoid such discrimination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The term &ldquo;mandatory contributions&rdquo; means amounts contributed to the plan by a participant which are required as a condition of employment, as a condition of participation in such plan, or as a condition of obtaining benefits under the plan attributable to employer contributions. For this purpose, the total amount of mandatory contributions of a participant is the amount of such contributions reduced (but not below zero) by the sum of the amounts paid or distributed to him under the plan before its termination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all liabilities of the plan to participants and their beneficiaries have been satisfied,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the distribution does not contravene any provision of law, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the plan provides for such a distribution in these circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In determining the extent to which a plan provides for the distribution of plan assets to the employer for purposes of paragraph (1)(C), any such provision, and any amendment increasing the amount which may be distributed to the employer, shall not be treated as effective before the end of the fifth calendar year following the date of the adoption of such provision or amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A distribution to the employer from a plan shall not be treated as failing to satisfy the requirements of this paragraph if the plan has been in effect for fewer than 5 years and the plan has provided for such a distribution since the effective date of the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except as otherwise provided in regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury, in any case in which a transaction described in section 1058 of this title occurs, subparagraph (A) shall continue to apply separately with respect to the amount of any assets transferred in such transaction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;employer&rdquo; includes any member of the controlled group of which the employer is a member. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;controlled group&rdquo; means any group treated as a single employer under subsection (b), (c), (m) or (<em>o</em>) of section 414 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before any distribution from a plan pursuant to paragraph (1), if any assets of the plan attributable to employee contributions remain after satisfaction of all liabilities described in subsection (a) of this section, such remaining assets shall be equitably distributed to the participants who made such contributions or their beneficiaries (including alternate payees, within the meaning of section 1056(d)(3)(K) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the portion of the remaining assets which are attributable to employee contributions shall be an amount equal to the product derived by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the market value of the total remaining assets, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the numerator of which is the present value of all portions of the accrued benefits with respect to participants which are derived from participants&rsquo; mandatory contributions (referred to in subsection (a)(2) of this section), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the denominator of which is the present value of all benefits with respect to which assets are allocated under paragraphs (2) through (6) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, each person who is, as of the termination date&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a participant under the plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an individual who has received, during the 3-year period ending with the termination date, a distribution from the plan of such individual's entire nonforfeitable benefit in the form of a single sum distribution in accordance with section 1053(e) of this title or in the form of irrevocable commitments purchased by the plan from an insurer to provide such nonforfeitable benefit,</p>
