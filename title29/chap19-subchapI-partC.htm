<p class="statutory-body">(3) To the extent that a State workers&rsquo; compensation law is applicable, workers&rsquo; compensation benefits in accordance with such law shall be available with respect to injuries suffered by participants. To the extent that such law is not applicable, each recipient of funds under this chapter shall secure insurance coverage for injuries suffered by such participants, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All individuals employed in subsidized jobs shall be provided benefits and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as other employees working a similar length of time and doing the same type of work.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No participant shall be employed or job opening filled (A) when any other individual is on layoff from the same or any substantially equivalent job, or (B) when the employer has terminated the employment of any regular employee or otherwise reduced its workforce with the intention of filling the vacancy so created by hiring a participant whose wages are subsidized under this chapter.</p>
