<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Effects of multiemployer pension plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) multiemployer pension plans have a substantial impact on interstate commerce and are affected with a national public interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) multiemployer pension plans have accounted for a substantial portion of the increase in private pension plan coverage over the past three decades;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the continued well-being and security of millions of employees, retirees, and their dependents are directly affected by multiemployer pension plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) withdrawals of contributing employers from a multiemployer pension plan frequently result in substantially increased funding obligations for employers who continue to contribute to the plan, adversely affecting the plan, its participants and beneficiaries, and labor-management relations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in a declining industry, the incidence of employer withdrawals is higher and the adverse effects described in subparagraph (A) are exacerbated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Modification of multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions and replacement of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is desirable to modify the current multiemployer plan termination insurance provisions in order to increase the likelihood of protecting plan participants against benefit losses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is desirable to replace the termination insurance program for multiemployer pension plans with an insolvency-based benefit protection program that will enhance the financial soundness of such plans, place primary emphasis on plan continuation, and contain program costs within reasonable limits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is hereby declared to be the policy of this Act&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to foster and facilitate interstate commerce,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:328 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to alleviate certain problems which tend to discourage the maintenance and growth of multiemployer pension plans,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide reasonable protection for the interests of participants and beneficiaries of financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide a financially self-sufficient program for the guarantee of employee benefits under multiemployer plans.</p>
