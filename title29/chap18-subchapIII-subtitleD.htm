The liability under this section of all such persons shall be joint and several. The liability under this section consists of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) liability to the corporation, to the extent provided in subsection (b) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) liability to the trustee appointed under subsection (b) or (c) of section 1342 of this title, to the extent provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liability to corporation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of liability</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule in case of subsequent insufficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), in any case described in section 1341(c)(3)(C)(ii) of this title, actuarial present values shall be determined as of the date of the notice to the corporation (or the finding by the corporation) described in such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment of liability</h4>

The parties involved shall make a reasonable effort to reach agreement on such commercially reasonable terms. Any such terms prescribed by the corporation shall provide for deferral of 50 percent of any amount of liability otherwise payable for any year under this subparagraph if a person subject to such liability demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that no per<!-- PDFPage:508 -->son subject to such liability has any individual pre-tax profits for such person's fiscal year ending during such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Alternative arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The corporation and any person liable under this section may agree to alternative arrangements for the satisfaction of liability to the corporation under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Liability to section 1342 trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person described in subsection (a) of this section shall be subject to liability under this subsection to the trustee appointed under subsection (b) or (c) of section 1342 of this title. The liability of such person under this subsection shall consist of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the outstanding balance of the accumulated funding deficiencies (within the meaning of section 1082(a)(2) of this title and section 412(a) of title 26) of the plan (if any) (which, for purposes of this subparagraph, shall include the amount of any increase in such accumulated funding deficiencies of the plan which would result if all pending applications for waivers of the minimum funding standard under section 1083 of this title or section 412(d) of title 26 and for extensions of the amortization period under section 1084 of this title or section 412(e) of title 26 with respect to such plan were denied and if no additional contributions (other than those already made by the termination date) were made for the plan year in which the termination date occurs or for any previous plan year),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the outstanding balance of the amount of waived funding deficiencies of the plan waived before such date under section 1083 of this title or section 412(d) of title 26 (if any), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the outstanding balance of the amount of decreases in the minimum funding standard allowed before such date under section 1084 of this title or section 412(e) of title 26 (if any),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">together with interest (at a reasonable rate) calculated from the termination date in accordance with regulations prescribed by the corporation. The liability under this subsection shall be due and payable to such trustee as of the termination date, in cash or securities acceptable to such trustee.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Collective net worth of persons subject to liability</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) have individual net worths which are greater than zero, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are (as of the termination date) contributing sponsors of the terminated plan or members of their controlled groups.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination of net worth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the net worth of a person is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determined on whatever basis best reflects, in the determination of the corporation, the current status of the person's operations and prospects at the time chosen for determining the net worth of the person, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) increased by the amount of any transfers of assets made by the person which are determined by the corporation to be improper under the circumstances, including any such transfers which would be inappropriate under title 11 if the person were a debtor in a case under chapter 7 of such title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Timing of determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, determinations of net worth shall be made as of a day chosen by the corporation (during the 120-day period ending with the termination date) and shall be computed without regard to any liability under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Pre-tax profits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for any fiscal year of an organization described in section 501(c) of title 26, the excess of income over expenses (as such terms are defined for such organizations under generally accepted accounting principles),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">before provision for or deduction of Federal or other income tax, any contribution to any single-employer plan of which such person is a contributing sponsor at any time during the period beginning on the termination date and ending with the end of such fiscal year, and any amounts required to be paid for such fiscal year under this section. The corporation may by regulation require such information to be filed on such forms as may be necessary to determine the existence and amount of such pre-tax profits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of substantial cessation of operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an employer ceases operations at a facility in any location and, as a result of such cessation of operations, more than 20 percent of the total number of his employees who are participants under a plan established and maintained by him are separated from employment, the employer shall be treated with respect to that plan as if he were a substantial employer under a plan under which more than one employer makes contributions and the provisions of sections 1363, 1364, and 1365 of this title shall apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the denominator of which is the total amount required to be contributed to the plan by all contributing sponsors for such last 5 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition to and in lieu of the manner prescribed in the preceding sentence, the corporation may also determine such liability on any other equitable basis prescribed by the corporation in regulations. Any amount collected by the corporation under this subsection shall be held in escrow subject to disposition in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Bond in lieu of payment of liability; 5-year termination period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In lieu of payment of a contributing sponsor's liability under this section, the contributing sponsor may be required to furnish a bond to the corporation in an amount not exceeding 150 percent of his liability to insure payment of his liability under this section. The bond shall have as surety thereon a corporate surety company which is an acceptable surety on Federal bonds under authority granted by the Secretary of the Treasury under sections 9304&ndash;9308 of title 31. Any such bond shall be in a form or of a type approved by the Secretary including individual bonds or schedule or blanket forms of bonds which cover a group or class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the plan is not terminated under section 1341(c) or 1342 of this title within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the liability is abated and any payment held in escrow shall be refunded without interest (or the bond cancelled) in accordance with bylaws or rules prescribed by the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the plan terminates under section 1341(c) or 1342 of this title within the 5-year period commencing on the day of withdrawal, the corporation shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) demand payment or realize on the bond and hold such amount in escrow for the benefit of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) treat any escrowed payments under this section as if they were plan assets and apply them in a manner consistent with this subtitle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) refund any amount to the contributing sponsor which is not required to meet any obligation of the corporation with respect to the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternate appropriate procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this subsection apply in the case of a withdrawal described in subsection (a) of this section, and the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section shall not apply, if the corporation determines that the procedure provided for under this subsection is consistent with the purposes of this section and section 1364 of this title and is more appropriate in the particular case. Upon a showing by the plan administrator of the plan that the withdrawal from the plan by one or more contributing sponsors has resulted, or will result, in a significant reduction in the amount of aggregate contributions to or under the plan, the corporation may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) require the plan fund to be equitable allocated between those participants no longer working in covered service under the plan as a result of the withdrawal, and those participants who remain in covered service under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) treat that portion of the plan funds allocable under paragraph (1) to participants no longer in covered service as a plan terminated under section 1342 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) treat that portion of the plan fund allocable to participants remaining in covered service as a separate plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Indemnity agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The corporation is authorized to waive the application of the provisions of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section whenever it determines that there is an indemnity agreement in effect among contributing sponsors under the plan which is adequate to satisfy the purposes of this section and of section 1364 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Creation of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any person liable to the corporation under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title neglects or refuses to pay, after demand, the amount of such liability (including interest), there shall be a lien in favor of the corporation in the amount of such liability (including interest) upon all property and rights to property, whether real or personal, belonging to such person, except that such lien may not be in an amount in excess of 30 percent of the collective net worth of all persons described in section 1362(a) of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1368_1_target" name="1368_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Term of lien</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The lien imposed by subsection (a) of this section arises on the date of termination of a plan, and continues until the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title is satisfied or becomes unenforceable by reason of lapse of time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as otherwise provided under this section, the priority of a lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section shall be determined in the same manner as under section 6323 of title 26 (as in effect on April 7, 1986).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;lien imposed by section 4068 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 <!-- PDFPage:514 -->[29 U.S.C. 1368]&rdquo; for &ldquo;lien imposed by section 6321&rdquo; each place it appears in subsections (a), (b), (c)(1), (c)(4)(B), (d), (e), and (h)(5);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;the corporation&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo; in subsections (a) and (b)(9)(C);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) &ldquo;a person whose property is subject to the lien&rdquo; for &ldquo;the taxpayer&rdquo; in subsections (b)(8), (c)(2)(A)(i) (the first place it appears), (c)(2)(A)(ii), (c)(2)(B), (c)(4)(B), and (c)(4)(C) (in the matter preceding clause (i));</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) &ldquo;section 4068(a) lien&rdquo; for &ldquo;tax lien&rdquo; each place it appears in subsections (c)(1), (c)(2)(A), (c)(2)(B), (c)(3)(B)(iii), (c)(4)(B), (d), and (h)(5); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) &ldquo;the date on which the lien is first filed&rdquo; for &ldquo;the date of the assessment of the tax&rdquo; in subsection (g)(3)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a case under title 11 or in insolvency proceedings, the lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated in the same manner as a tax due and owing to the United States for purposes of title 11 or section 3713 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of applying section 6323(a) of title 26 to determine the priority between the lien imposed under subsection (a) of this section and a Federal tax lien, each lien shall be treated as a judgment lien arising as of the time notice of such lien is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, notice of the lien imposed by subsection (a) of this section shall be filed in the same manner as under section 6323(f) and (g) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Civil action; limitation period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, the corporation may bring civil action in a district court of the United States to enforce the lien of the corporation under this section with respect to such liability or to subject any property, of whatever nature, of the liable person, or in which he has any right, title, or interest to the payment of such liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The liability imposed by section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title may be collected by a proceeding in court if the proceeding is commenced within 6 years after the date upon which the plan was terminated or prior to the expiration of any period for collection agreed upon in writing by the corporation and the liable person before the expiration of such 6-year period. The period of limitations provided under this paragraph shall be suspended for the period the assets of the liable person are in the control or custody of any court of the United States, or of any State, or of the District of Columbia, and for 6 months thereafter, and for any period during which the liable person is outside the United States if such period of absence is for a continuous period of at least 6 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Release or subordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the corporation determines that release of the lien or subordination of the lien to any other creditor of the liable person would not adversely affect the collection of the liability imposed under section 1362, 1363, or 1364 of this title, or that the amount realizable by the corporation from the property to which the lien attaches will ultimately be increased by such release or subordination, and that the ultimate collection of the liability will be facilitated by such release or subordination, the corporation may issue a certificate of release or subordination of the lien with respect to such property, or any part thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The collective net worth of persons subject to liability in connection with a plan termination shall be determined as provided in section 1362(d)(1) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Treatment of transactions to evade liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a principal purpose of any person in entering into any transaction is to evade liability to which such person would be subject under this subtitle and the transaction becomes effective within five years before the termination date of the termination on which such liability would be based, then such person and the members of such person's controlled group (determined as of the termination date) shall be subject to liability under this subtitle in connection with such termination as if such person were a contributing sponsor of the terminated plan as of the termination date. This subsection shall not cause any person to be liable under this subtitle in connection with such plan termination for any increases or improvements in the benefits provided under the plan which are adopted after the date on which the transaction referred to in the preceding sentence becomes effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Effect of corporate reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subtitle, the following rules apply in the case of certain corporate reorganizations:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Change of identity, form, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a person ceases to exist by reason of a reorganization which involves a mere change in identity, form, or place of organization, however effected, a successor corporation resulting from such reorganization shall be treated as the person to whom this subtitle applies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Liquidation into parent corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a person ceases to exist by reason of liquidation into a parent corporation, the parent corporation shall be treated as the person to whom this subtitle applies.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who is with respect to a single-employer plan a fiduciary, contributing sponsor, member of a contributing sponsor's controlled group, participant, or beneficiary, and is adversely affected by an act or practice of any party (other than the corporation) in violation of any provision of section 1341, 1342, 1362, 1363, 1364, or 1369 of this title, or who is an employee organization representing such a participant or beneficiary so adversely affected for purposes of collective bargaining with respect to such plan, may bring an action&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Status of plan as party to action and with respect to legal process</h4>

Service of summons, subpoena, or other legal process of a court upon a trustee or an administrator of a single-employer plan in such trustee's or administrator's capacity as such shall constitute service upon the plan. If a plan has not designated in the summary plan description of the plan an individual as agent for the service of legal process, service upon any contributing sponsor of the plan shall constitute such service. Any money judgment under this section against a single-employer plan shall be enforceable only against the plan as an entity and shall not be enforceable against any other person unless liability against such person is established in such person's individual capacity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Jurisdiction and venue</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The district courts of the United States shall have exclusive jurisdiction of civil actions under this section. Such actions may be brought in the district where the plan is administered, where the violation took place, or where a defendant resides or may be found, and process may be served in any other district where a defendant resides or may be found. The district courts of the United States shall have jurisdiction, without regard to the amount in controversy or the citizenship of the parties, to grant the relief provided for in subsection (a) of this section in any action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Right of corporation to intervene</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A copy of the complaint or notice of appeal in any action under this section shall be served upon the corporation by certified mail. The corporation shall have the right in its discretion to intervene in any action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Awards of costs and expenses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any action brought under this section, the court in its discretion may award all or a portion of the costs and expenses incurred in connection with such action, including reasonable attorney's fees, to any party who prevails or substantially prevails in such action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exemption for plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, no plan shall be required in any action to pay any costs and expenses (including attorney's fees).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on actions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (3), an action under this section may not be brought after the later of&mdash;</p>
