<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) Funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Labor shall use funds available under section 1356(s)(2) of title 8 to establish demonstration programs or projects to provide technical skills training for workers, including both employed and unemployed workers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Training provided</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Training funded by a program or project described in subparagraph (A) shall be for persons who are currently employed and who wish to obtain and upgrade skills as well as for persons who are unemployed. Such training is not limited to skill levels commensurate with a four-year undergraduate degree, but should include the preparation of workers for a broad range of positions along a career ladder. Consideration shall be given to the use of grant funds to demonstrate a significant ability to expand a training program or project through such means as training more workers or offering more courses, and training programs or projects resulting from collaborations, especially with more than one small business or with a labor-management training program or project. The need for the training shall be justified through reliable regional, State, or local data.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(2) Grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To carry out the programs and projects described in paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary of Labor shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Commerce, subject to the availability of funds in the H&ndash;1B Nonimmigrant Petitioner Account, award&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) 75 percent of the grants to a local workforce investment board established under section 116(b) [29 U.S.C. 2831(b)] or section 117 of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2832) or consortia of such boards in a region.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Designation of responsible fiscal agents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each partnership formed under subparagraph (A) shall designate a responsible fiscal agent to receive and disburse grant funds under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(D) Allocation of grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making grants under this paragraph, the Secretary shall make every effort to fairly distribute grants across rural and urban areas, and across the different geographic regions of the United States. The total amount of grants awarded to carry out programs and projects described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be allocated as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) At least 80 percent of the grants shall be awarded to programs and projects that train employed and unemployed workers in skills in high technology, information technology, and biotechnology, including skills needed for software and communications services, telecommunications, systems installation and integration, computers and communications hardware, advanced manufacturing, health care technology, biotechnology and biomedical research and manufacturing, and innovation services.</p>
