The parties involved shall make a reasonable effort to reach agreement on such commercially reasonable terms. Any such terms prescribed by the corporation shall provide for deferral of 50 percent of any amount of liability otherwise payable for any year under this subparagraph if a person subject to such liability demonstrates to the satisfaction of the corporation that no person subject to such liability has any individual pre-tax profits for such person's fiscal year ending during such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Alternative arrangements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The corporation and any person liable under this section may agree to alternative arrangements for the satisfaction of liability to the corporation under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination of net worth</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the net worth of a person is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determined on whatever basis best reflects, in the determination of the corporation, the current status of the person's op<!-- PDFPage:512 -->erations and prospects at the time chosen for determining the net worth of the person, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) increased by the amount of any transfers of assets made by the person which are determined by the corporation to be improper under the circumstances, including any such transfers which would be inappropriate under title 11 if the person were a debtor in a case under chapter 7 of such title.</p>

The corporation may by regulation require such information to be filed on such forms as may be necessary to determine the existence and amount of such pre-tax profits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of substantial cessation of operations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an employer ceases operations at a facility in any location and, as a result of such cessation of operations, more than 20 percent of the total number of his employees who are participants under a plan established and maintained by him are separated from employment, the employer shall be treated with respect to that plan as if he were a substantial employer under a plan under which more than one employer makes contributions and the provisions of sections 1363, 1364, and 1365 of this title shall apply.</p>
