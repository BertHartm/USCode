<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a brokering contractor enters into a contract with a subcontractor to provide training or other services, the brokering contractor shall ensure, through on-site monitoring, compliance with subcontract terms prior to making payment to the subcontractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, on-the-job training contracts under this chapter shall not be entered into with employers who have received payments under previous contracts and have exhibited a pattern of failing to provide on-the-job training participants with continued long-term employment as regular employees with wages and employment benefits (including health benefits) and working conditions at the same level and to the same extent as other employees working a similar length of time and doing the same type of work.</p>
