<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by such State for carrying out the provisions of this subpart, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the provisions of this subpart to one or more of the States that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
