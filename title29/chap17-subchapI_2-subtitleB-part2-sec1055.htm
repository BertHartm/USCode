<p class="statutory-body">Each pension plan to which this section applies shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of a vested participant who does not die before the annuity starting date, the accrued benefit payable to such participant shall be provided in the form of a qualified joint and survivor annuity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a vested participant who dies before the annuity starting date and who has a surviving spouse, a qualified preretirement survivor annuity shall be provided to the surviving spouse of such participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applicable plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) This section shall apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any defined benefit plan,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any individual account plan which is subject to the funding standards of section 1082 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any participant under any other individual account plan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such plan provides that the participant's nonforfeitable accrued benefit (reduced by any security interest held by the plan by reason of a loan outstanding to such participant) is payable in full, on the death of the participant, to the participant's surviving spouse (or, if there is no surviving spouse or the surviving spouse consents in the manner required under subsection (c)(2) of this section, to a designated beneficiary),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such participant does not elect the payment of benefits in the form of a life annuity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) with respect to such participant, such plan is not a direct or indirect transferee (in a transfer after December 31, 1984) of a plan which is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) or to which this clause applied with respect to the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Clause (iii) of subparagraph (C) shall apply only with respect to the transferred assets (and income therefrom) if the plan separately accounts for such assets and any income therefrom.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a tax credit employee stock ownership plan (as defined in section 409(a) of title 26), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1055_2_target" name="1055_2">2</a></sup> This section shall not apply to a plan which the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate has determined is a plan described in section 404(c) of title 26 (or a continuation thereof) in which participation is substantially limited to individuals who, before January 1, 1976, ceased employment covered by the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1055_2_target" name="1055_2">2</a></sup> A plan shall not be treated as failing to meet the requirements of paragraph (1)(C) or (2) merely because the plan provides that benefits will not be payable to the surviving spouse of the participant unless the participant and such spouse had been married throughout the 1-year period ending on the earlier of the participant's annuity starting date or the date of the participant's death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Plans meeting requirements of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A plan meets the requirements of this section only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) under the plan, each participant&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:386 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) may revoke any such election at any time during the applicable election period, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plan meets the requirements of paragraphs (2), (3), and (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the spouse of the participant consents in writing to such election, (ii) such election designates a beneficiary (or a form of benefits) which may not be changed without spousal consent (or the consent of the spouse expressly permits designations by the participant without any requirement of further consent by the spouse), and (iii) the spouse's consent acknowledges the effect of such election and is witnessed by a plan representative or a notary public, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) it is established to the satisfaction of a plan representative that the consent required under subparagraph (A) may not be obtained because there is no spouse, because the spouse cannot be located, or because of such other circumstances as the Secretary of the Treasury may by regulations prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any consent by a spouse (or establishment that the consent of a spouse may not be obtained) under the preceding sentence shall be effective only with respect to such spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within a reasonable period of time before the annuity starting date (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary of the Treasury may prescribe) a written explanation of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the terms and conditions of the qualified joint and survivor annuity,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the participant's right to make, and the effect of, an election under paragraph (1) to waive the joint and survivor annuity form of benefit,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the rights of the participant's spouse under paragraph (2), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the right to make, and the effect of, a revocation of an election under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Each plan shall provide to each participant, within the applicable period with respect to such participant (and consistent with such regulations as the Secretary may prescribe), a written explanation with respect to the qualified preretirement survivor annuity comparable to that required under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;applicable period&rdquo; means, with respect to a participant, whichever of the following periods ends last:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) The period beginning with the first day of the plan year in which the participant attains age 32 and ending with the close of the plan year preceding the plan year in which the participant attains age 35.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) A reasonable period after the individual becomes a participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) A reasonable period ending after paragraph (5) ceases to apply to the participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) A reasonable period ending after this section applies to the participant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who separates from service before attaining age 35, the applicable period shall be a reasonable period after separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each plan shall provide that, if this section applies to a participant when part or all of the participant's accrued benefit is to be used as security for a loan, no portion of the participant's accrued benefit may be used as security for such loan unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the spouse of the participant (if any) consents in writing to such use during the 90-day period ending on the date on which the loan is to be so secured, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requirements comparable to the requirements of paragraph (2) are met with respect to such consent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The requirements of this subsection shall not apply with respect to the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit or the qualified preretirement survivor annuity form of benefit, as the case may be, if such benefit may not be waived (or another beneficiary selected) and if the plan fully subsidizes the costs of such benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), a plan fully subsidizes the costs of a benefit if under the plan the failure to waive such benefit by a participant would not result in a decrease in any plan benefits with respect to such participant and would not result in increased contributions from such participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If a plan fiduciary acts in accordance with part 4 of this subtitle in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) relying on a consent or revocation referred to in paragraph (1)(A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) making a determination under paragraph (2),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such consent, revocation, or determination shall be treated as valid for purposes of discharging the plan from liability to the extent of payments made pursuant to such Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;applicable election period&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an election to waive the qualified joint and survivor annuity form of benefit, the 90-day period ending on the annuity starting date, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a participant who is separated from service, the applicable election period under subparagraph (B) with respect to benefits accrued before the date of such separation from service shall not begin later than such date.</p>
