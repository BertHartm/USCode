<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement to meet minimum funding standard</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan to which this part applies shall satisfy the minimum funding standard applicable to the plan for any plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum funding standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), a plan shall be treated as satisfying the minimum funding standard for a plan year if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a defined benefit plan which is a single-employer plan, the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which, in the aggregate, are not less than the minimum required contribution determined under section 1083 of this title for the plan for the plan year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a money purchase plan which is a single-employer plan, the employer makes contributions to or under the plan for the plan year which are required under the terms of the plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the employers make contributions to or under the plan for any plan year which, in the aggregate, are sufficient to ensure that the plan does not have an accumulated funding deficiency under section 1084 of this title as of the end of the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Liability for contributions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the amount of any contribution required by this section (including any required installments under paragraphs (3) and (4) of section 1083(j) of this title) shall be paid by the employer responsible for making contributions to or under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Joint and several liability where employer member of controlled group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the employer referred to in paragraph (1) is a member of a controlled group, each member of such group shall be jointly and severally liable for payment of such contributions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Multiemployer plans in critical status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply in the case of a multiemployer plan for any plan year in which the plan is in critical status pursuant to section 1085 of this title. This paragraph shall only apply if the plan sponsor adopts a rehabilitation plan in accordance with section 1085(e) of this title and complies with the terms of such rehabilitation plan (and any updates or modifications of the plan).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Variance from minimum funding standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Waiver in case of business hardship</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an employer is (or in the case of a multiemployer plan, 10 percent or more of the number of employers contributing to or under the plan are) unable to satisfy the minimum funding standard for a plan year without temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) application of the standard would be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the Secretary of the Treasury may, subject to subparagraph (C), waive the requirements of subsection (a) for such year with respect to all or any portion of the minimum funding standard. The Secretary of the Treasury shall not waive the minimum funding standard with respect to a plan for more than 3 of any 15 (5 of any 15 in the case of a multiemployer plan) consecutive plan years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Effects of waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a waiver is granted under subparagraph (A) for any plan year&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:385 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of a single-employer plan, the minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for the plan year shall be reduced by the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1083(e) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a multiemployer plan, the funding standard account shall be credited under section 1084(b)(3)(C) of this title with the amount of the waived funding deficiency and such amount shall be amortized as required under section 1084(b)(2)(C) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver of amortized portion not allowed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may not waive under subparagraph (A) any portion of the minimum funding standard under subsection (a) for a plan year which is attributable to any waived funding deficiency for any preceding plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of business hardship</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the factors taken into account in determining temporary substantial business hardship (substantial business hardship in the case of a multiemployer plan) shall include (but shall not be limited to) whether or not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the employer is operating at an economic loss,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there is substantial unemployment or underemployment in the trade or business and in the industry concerned,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the sales and profits of the industry concerned are depressed or declining, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) it is reasonable to expect that the plan will be continued only if the waiver is granted.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Waived funding deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;waived funding deficiency&rdquo; means the portion of the minimum funding standard under subsection (a) (determined without regard to the waiver) for a plan year waived by the Secretary of the Treasury and not satisfied by employer contributions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Security for waivers for single-employer plans, consultations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Security may be required</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Secretary of the Treasury may require an employer maintaining a defined benefit plan which is a single-employer plan (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(15) of this title) to provide security to such plan as a condition for granting or modifying a waiver under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any security provided under clause (i) may be perfected and enforced only by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, or at the direction of the Corporation, by a contributing sponsor (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(13) of this title), or a member of such sponsor's controlled group (within the meaning of section 1301(a)(14) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consultation with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting or modifying a waiver under this subsection with respect to a plan described in subparagraph (A)(i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provide the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) notice of the completed application for any waiver or modification, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) an opportunity to comment on such application within 30 days after receipt of such notice, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) any comments of the Corporation under clause (i)(II), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any views of any employee organization (within the meaning of section 1002(4) of this title) representing participants in the plan which are submitted in writing to the Secretary of the Treasury in connection with such application.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Information provided to the Corporation under this subparagraph shall be considered tax return information and subject to the safeguarding and reporting requirements of section 6103(p) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exception for certain waivers</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The preceding provisions of this paragraph shall not apply to any plan with respect to which the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the aggregate unpaid minimum required contributions for the plan year and all preceding plan years, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the present value of all waiver amortization installments determined for the plan year and succeeding plan years under section 1083(e)(2) of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;is less than $1,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Treatment of waivers for which applications are pending</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount described in clause (i)(I) shall include any increase in such amount which would result if all applications for waivers of the minimum funding standard under this subsection which are pending with respect to such plan were denied.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Unpaid minimum required contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The term &ldquo;unpaid minimum required contribution&rdquo; means, with respect to any plan year, any minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for the plan year which is not paid on or before the due date (as determined under section 1083(j)(1) of this title) for the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Ordering rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of subclause (I), any payment to or under a plan for any plan year shall be allocated first to unpaid minimum required contributions for all <!-- PDFPage:386 -->preceding plan years on a first-in, first-out basis and then to the minimum required contribution under section 1083 of this title for the plan year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special rules for single-employer plans</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Application must be submitted before date 21/2 months after close of year</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a single-employer plan, no waiver may be granted under this subsection with respect to any plan for any plan year unless an application therefor is submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury not later than the 15th day of the 3rd month beginning after the close of such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule if employer is member of controlled group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a single-employer plan, if an employer is a member of a controlled group, the temporary substantial business hardship requirements of paragraph (1) shall be treated as met only if such requirements are met&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with respect to such employer, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to the controlled group of which such employer is a member (determined by treating all members of such group as a single employer).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may provide that an analysis of a trade or business or industry of a member need not be conducted if such Secretary determines such analysis is not necessary because the taking into account of such member would not significantly affect the determination under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Advance notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall, before granting a waiver under this subsection, require each applicant to provide evidence satisfactory to such Secretary that the applicant has provided notice of the filing of the application for such waiver to each affected party (as defined in section 1301(a)(21) of this title).

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Restriction on plan amendments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No amendment of a plan which increases the liabilities of the plan by reason of any increase in benefits, any change in the accrual of benefits, or any change in the rate at which benefits become nonforfeitable under the plan shall be adopted if a waiver under this subsection or an extension of time under section 1084(d) of this title is in effect with respect to the plan, or if a plan amendment described in subsection (d)(2) which reduces the accrued benefit of any participant has been made at any time in the preceding 12 months (24 months in the case of a multiemployer plan).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in paragraph (2), the amount, determined as of the end of the plan year, equal to the excess (if any) of the total charges to the funding standard account of the plan for all plan years (beginning with the first plan year for which this part applies to the plan) over the total credits to such account for such years, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the multiemployer plan is in reorganization for any plan year, the accumulated funding deficiency of the plan determined under section 1423 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credits to account</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may be offset against amounts required to be amortized under the other such paragraph, with the resulting amount to be amortized over a period determined on the basis of the remaining amortization periods for all items entering into whichever of the two amounts being offset is the greater.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The funding standard account (and items therein) shall be charged or credited (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury) with interest at the appropriate rate consistent with the rate or rates of interest used under the plan to determine costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount received by a multiemployer plan in payment of all or part of an employer's withdrawal liability under part 1 of subtitle E of subchapter III shall be considered an amount contributed by the employer to or under the plan. The Secretary of the <!-- PDFPage:401 -->Treasury may prescribe by regulation additional charges and credits to a multiemployer plan's funding standard account to the extent necessary to prevent withdrawal liability payments from being unduly reflected as advance funding for plan liabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustments when a multiemployer plan leaves reorganization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a multiemployer plan is not in reorganization in the plan year but was in reorganization in the immediately preceding plan year, any balance in the funding standard account at the close of such immediately preceding plan year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be eliminated by an offsetting credit or charge (as the case may be), but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall be taken into account in subsequent plan years by being amortized in equal annual installments (until fully amortized) over 30 plan years.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Short-term benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that any plan amendment increases the unfunded past service liability under the plan by reason of an increase in benefits which are not payable as a life annuity but are payable under the terms of the plan for a period that does not exceed 14 years from the effective date of the amendment, paragraph (2)(B)(ii) shall be applied separately with respect to such increase in unfunded past service liability by substituting the number of years of the period during which such benefits are payable for &ldquo;15&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determinations to be made under funding method</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish mortality tables which may be used (in lieu of the tables under clause (iv)) to determine current liability under this subsection for individuals who are entitled to benefits under the plan on account of disability. Such Secretary shall establish separate tables for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning before January 1, 1995, and for individuals whose disabilities occur in plan years beginning on or after such date.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Special rule for disabilities occurring after 1994</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">In the case of disabilities occurring in plan years beginning after December 31, 1994, the tables under subclause (I) shall apply only with respect to individuals described in such subclause who are disabled within the meaning of title II of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 401 et seq.] and the regulations thereunder.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall periodically (at least every 5 years) review any tables in effect under this subparagraph <!-- PDFPage:403 -->and shall, to the extent such Secretary determines necessary, by regulation update the tables to reflect the actual experience of pension plans and projected trends in such experience.</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that the lowest rate of interest permissible under subclause (I) is unreasonably high, such Secretary may prescribe a lower rate of interest, except that such rate may not be less than 80 percent of the average rate determined under such subclause.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding paragraph (3)(A), the interest rate used under the plan shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) determined without taking into account the experience of the plan and reasonable expectations, but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) consistent with the assumptions which reflect the purchase rates which would be used by insurance companies to satisfy the liabilities under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Annual valuation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section, a determination of experience gains and losses and a valuation of the plan's liability shall be made not less frequently than once every year, except that such determination shall be made more frequently to the extent required in particular cases under regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Use of prior year valuation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The valuation referred to in subparagraph (A) may be made as of a date within the plan year prior to the year to which the valuation refers if, as of such date, the value of the assets of the plan are not less than 100 percent of the plan's current liability (as defined in paragraph (6)(D) without regard to clause (iv) thereof).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustments</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A certification with respect to a multiemployer plan is described in this subparagraph if the plan's actuary certifies that, based on reasonable assumptions&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the plan sponsor has adopted a plan to improve the plan's funding status,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the plan is projected to have sufficient assets to timely pay expected bene<!-- PDFPage:404 -->fits and anticipated expenditures over the amortization period as extended, and</p>

Such extension shall be in addition to any extension under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury may grant an extension under subparagraph (A) if such Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such extension would carry out the purposes of this chapter and would provide adequate protection for participants under the plan and their beneficiaries, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the failure to permit such extension would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) result in a substantial risk to the voluntary continuation of the plan, or a substantial curtailment of pension benefit levels or employee compensation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) be adverse to the interests of plan participants in the aggregate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Action by Secretary of the Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall act upon any application for an extension under this paragraph within 180 days of the submission of such application.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Actuarial projections of assets and liabilities</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In making the determinations and projections under this subsection, the plan actuary shall make projections required for the current and succeeding plan years of the current value of the assets of the plan and the present value of all liabilities to participants and beneficiaries under the plan for the current plan year as of the beginning of such year. The actuary's projections shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the actuarial statement required under section 1023(d) of this title with respect to the most recently filed annual report, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any actuarial projection of plan assets shall assume&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current and succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of the one or more collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that employer contributions for the most recent plan year will continue indefinitely, but only if the plan actuary determines there have been no significant demographic changes that would make such assumption unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Projected industry activity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any projection of activity in the industry or industries covered by the plan, including future covered employment and contribution levels, shall be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which shall act reasonably and in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Penalty for failure to secure timely actuarial certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any failure of the plan's actuary to certify the plan's status under this subsection by the date specified in subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of section 1132(c)(2) of this title as a failure or refusal by the plan administrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under section 1021(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Notice</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Model notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1085_1_target" name="1085_1">1</a></sup> shall prescribe a model notice that a multiemployer plan may use to satisfy the requirements under clause (ii).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
