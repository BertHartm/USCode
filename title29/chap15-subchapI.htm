<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; purpose; policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) work&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is a valued activity, both for individuals and society; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) fulfills the need of an individual to be productive, promotes independence, enhances self-esteem, and allows for participation in the mainstream of life in America;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as a group, individuals with disabilities experience staggering levels of unemployment and poverty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, have demonstrated their ability to achieve gainful employment in integrated settings if appropriate services and supports are provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) reasons for the significant number of individuals with disabilities not working, or working at a level not commensurate with their abilities and capabilities, include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) discrimination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) lack of accessible and available transportation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) fear of losing health coverage under the medicare and medicaid programs under titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq. and 1396 et seq.) or fear of losing existing private health insurance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) lack of education, training, and supports to meet job qualification standards necessary to enter or retain or advance in employment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) enforcement of subchapter V of this chapter and of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.) holds the promise of ending discrimination for individuals with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the provision of vocational rehabilitation services can enable individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, to pursue meaningful careers by securing gainful employment commensurate with their abilities and capabilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The purpose of this subchapter is to assist States in operating a comprehensive, coordinated, effective, efficient, and accountable program of vocational rehabilitation that is designed to assess, plan, develop, and provide vocational rehabilitation services for individuals with disabilities, consistent with their strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities, so that such individuals may prepare for and engage in gainful employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) It is the policy of the United States that such a program shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Individuals with disabilities, including individuals with the most severe disabilities, are generally presumed to be capable of engaging in gainful employment and the provision of individualized vocational rehabilitation services can improve their ability to become gainfully employed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Individuals with disabilities must be provided the opportunities to obtain gainful employment in integrated settings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Individuals with disabilities must be active participants in their own rehabilitation programs, including making meaningful and informed choices about the selection of their vocational goals and objectives and the vocational rehabilitation services they receive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Families and natural supports can play an important role in the success of a vocational rehabilitation program, if the individual with a disability requests, desires, or needs such supports.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:196 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Qualified vocational rehabilitation counselors, other qualified rehabilitation personnel, and other qualified personnel facilitate the accomplishment of the employment goals and objectives of an individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Individuals with disabilities and their advocates are full partners in the vocational rehabilitation program and must be involved on a regular basis and in a meaningful manner with respect to policy development and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Accountability measures must facilitate and not impede the accomplishment of the goals and objectives of the program, including providing vocational rehabilitation services to, among others, individuals with the most severe disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of making grants to States under part B of this subchapter (other than grants under section 732 of this title) to assist States in meeting the costs of vocational rehabilitation services provided in accordance with State plans under section 721 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1993 through 1997, except that the amount to be appropriated for a fiscal year shall not be less than the amount of the appropriation under this subsection for the immediately preceding fiscal year, plus the amount of the Consumer Price Index addition determined under subsection (c) of this section for the immediately preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out part C of this subchapter such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1993 through 1997.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Percentage change in Consumer Price Index; publication in Federal Register; increase in appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No later than November 15 of each fiscal year (beginning with the fiscal year 1979), the Secretary of Labor shall publish in the Federal Register the percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published for October of the preceding fiscal year and October of the fiscal year in which such publication is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) indicates an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1) increased by such percentage change.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If in any fiscal year the percentage change published under paragraph (1) does not indicate an increase in the Consumer Price Index, then the amount to be appropriated under subsection (b) of this section for the subsequent fiscal year shall be at least the amount appropriated for the fiscal year in which the publication is made under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Consumer Price Index&rdquo; means the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Extension of program authorization or duration; appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Unless the Congress in the regular session which ends prior to the beginning of the terminal fiscal year&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For the purposes of subdivision (i) of paragraph (1), the Congress shall not have been deemed to have passed legislation unless such legislation becomes law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where the Commissioner is required under an applicable statute to carry out certain acts or make certain determinations which are necessary for the continuation of the program authorized by this subchapter, if such acts or determinations are required during the terminal year of such program, such acts and determinations shall be required during any fiscal year in which that part of paragraph (1) of this subsection which follows subdivision (ii) of paragraph (1) is in operation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual who has a disability or is blind as determined pursuant to title II or title XVI of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 401 et seq. and 1381 et seq.) shall be considered to have&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a physical or mental impairment which for such individual constitutes or results in a substantial impediment to employment under section 706(8)(A)(i) of this title; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Determinations made by officials of other agencies, particularly the education officials described in section 721(a)(24) of this title, regarding whether an individual satisfies one or more factors relating to whether an individual is an individual with a disability under section 706(8)(A) of this title or an individual with a severe disability under section 706(15)(A) of this title, shall be used (to the extent appropriate and available and consistent with the requirements under this chapter) for making such determinations under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) It shall be presumed that an individual can benefit in terms of an employment outcome from vocational rehabilitation services under section 706(8)(A)(ii) of this title, unless the designated State unit can demonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that such individual is incapable of benefiting from vocational rehabilitation services in terms of an employment outcome.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such an extended evaluation is required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The determination of eligibility shall be based on the review of existing data described in section 706(22)(A)(i) of this title, and, to the extent necessary, the preliminary assessment described in section 706(22)(A)(ii) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The Director may not overturn or modify a decision of an impartial hearing officer, or part of such a decision, that supports the position of the individual unless the Director concludes, based on clear and convincing evidence, that the decision of the independent hearing officer is clearly erroneous on the basis of being contrary to Federal or State law, including policy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, for each fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment of an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount authorized to be appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section as the product of (A) the population of the State, and (B) the square of its allotment percentage, bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment in an amount equal to the amount such State received under paragraph (1) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and an additional amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1978, each State shall be entitled to an allotment, from any amount authorized to be appropriated for such fiscal year under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title for allotment under this section in excess of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, in an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) an amount bearing the same ratio to 50 percent of such excess amount as the product of the population of the State and its allotment percentage bears to the sum of the corresponding products for all the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The sum of the payment to any State (other than Guam, American Samoa, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau) under this subsection for any fiscal year which is less than one-third of 1 percent of the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1)(A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title, or $3,000,000, whichever is greater, shall be increased to that amount, the total of the increases thereby required being derived by proportionately reducing the allotment to each of the remaining such States under this subsection, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the sum of the allotments made under this subsection to any such remaining State from being thereby reduced to less than that amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For each fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1984, for which any amount is appropriated pursuant to section 720(b)(1)(B)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#730_1_target" name="730_1">1</a></sup> of this title, each State shall receive an allocation (from such appropriated amount) in addition to the allotment to which such State is entitled under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection.

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Republic of Palau may receive allotments or allocations under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional payments; authorization of additional appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the payment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for a fiscal year is less than the total payments such State received under section 2 of the Vocational Rehabilitation Act for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, such State shall be entitled to an additional payment (subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to other payments under this part) equal to the difference between such payment under section 731(a) of this title and the amount so received by it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a State receives as its Federal share under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year less than the applicable Federal share of the expenditure of such State for fiscal year 1972 for vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for such State approved under section 721 of this title (including any amount expended by such State for the administration of the State plan but excluding any amount expended by such State from non-Federal sources for construction under such plan), such State shall be entitled to an additional payment for such fiscal year, subject to the same terms and conditions applicable to other payments under this part, equal to the difference between such payment under section 731(a) of this title and an amount equal to the applicable Federal share of such expenditure for vocational rehabilitation services.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:222 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Any payment attributable to the additional payment to a State under this subsection shall be made only from appropriations specifically made to carry out this subsection, and such additional appropriations are hereby authorized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unused funds; redistribution; increase in amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than forty-five days prior to the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall determine, after reasonable opportunity for the submission to the Commissioner of comments by the State agency administering or supervising the program established under this subchapter, that any payment of an allotment to a State under section 731(a) of this title for any fiscal year will not be utilized by such State in carrying out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable but not later than the end of the fiscal year, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this subchapter to one or more other States to the extent the Commissioner determines that such other State will be able to use such additional amount during that fiscal year or the subsequent fiscal year for carrying out such purposes. The Commissioner shall make such amount available only if such other State will be able to make sufficient payments from non-Federal sources to pay for the non-Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the State plan for the fiscal year for which the amount was appropriated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this part, any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to this subsection shall be regarded as an increase of such State's allotment (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funds for American Indian vocational rehabilitation services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For fiscal year 1987 and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Commissioner shall reserve from the amount appropriated under section 720(b)(1) of this title for allotment under this section a sum, determined under paragraph (2), to carry out the purposes of part D of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The sum referred to in paragraph (1) shall be, as determined by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not less than one-third of one percent and not more than 1.5 percent of the amount under paragraph (1), for fiscal years 1993 and 1994; and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), from each State's allotment under this part for any fiscal year, the Commissioner shall pay to a State an amount equal to the Federal share of the cost of vocational rehabilitation services under the plan for that State approved under section 721 of this title, including expenditures for the administration of the State plan and development and implementation of the strategic plan as provided in section 721(a)(34)(A) of this title. Any State that receives such an amount shall expend, for development and implementation of the strategic plan, not less than the percentage of the allotment of the State referred to in section 721(a)(34)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The total of payments under paragraph (1) to a State for a fiscal year may not exceed its allotment under subsection (a),<sup><a href="#731_1_target" name="731_1">1</a></sup> of section 730 of this title for such year and such payments shall not be made in an amount which would result in a violation of the provisions of the State plan required by section 721(a)(17) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) For fiscal year 1993, the amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for the previous fiscal year are less than the average of the total of such expenditures for the 3 fiscal years preceding the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For fiscal year 1994 and each fiscal year thereafter, the amount otherwise payable to a State for a fiscal year under this section shall be reduced by the amount by which expenditures from non-Federal sources under the State plan under this subchapter for the previous fiscal year are less than the total of such expenditures for the second fiscal year preceding the previous fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Commissioner may waive or modify any requirement or limitation under paragraphs (A) and (B) if the Commissioner determines that a waiver or modification is an equitable response to exceptional or uncontrollable circumstances affecting the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount of a payment under this section with respect to any construction project in any State shall be equal to the same percentage of the cost of such project as the Federal share that is applicable in the case of rehabilitation facilities (as defined in section 291<em>o</em>(g) of title 42), in such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Federal share with respect to rehabilitation facilities in such State is determined pursuant to section 291<em>o</em>(b)(2) of title 42, the percentage of the cost for purposes of this section shall be determined in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Commissioner designed to achieve as nearly as practicable results comparable to the results obtained under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of computation and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method of computing and paying amounts pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Commissioner shall, prior to the beginning of each calendar quarter or other period prescribed by the Commissioner, estimate the amount to be paid to each State under the provisions of such subsection for such period, such estimate to be based on such records of the State and information furnished by it, and such other investigation as the Commissioner may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Commissioner shall pay, from the allotment available therefor, the amount so estimated by the Commissioner for such period, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (not previously adjusted under this paragraph) by which the Commissioner finds that the estimate of the amount to be paid the State for any prior period under such subsection was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such prior period under such subsection. Such payment shall be made prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office, shall be made through the disbursing facilities of the Treasury Department, and shall be made in such installments as the Commissioner may determine.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of grant program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From funds appropriated under subsection (i) of this section, the Secretary shall, in accordance with this section, make grants to States to establish and carry out client assistance programs to provide assistance in informing and advising all clients and client applicants of all available benefits under this chapter, and, upon request of such clients or client applicants, to assist and advocate for such clients or applicants in their relationships with projects, programs, and community rehabilitation programs providing services to them under this chapter, including assistance and advocacy in pursuing legal, administrative, or other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of the rights of such individuals under this chapter and to facilitate access to the services funded under this chapter through individual and systemic advocacy. The client assistance program shall provide information on the available services and benefits under this chapter and title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12111 et seq.) to individuals with disabilities in the State, especially with regard to individuals with disabilities who have traditionally been unserved or underserved by vocational rehabilitation programs. In providing assistance and advocacy under this subsection with respect to services under this subchapter, a client assistance program may provide the assistance and advocacy with respect to services that are directly related to facilitating the employment of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Existence of State program as requisite to receiving payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State may receive payments from its allotment under this chapter in any fiscal year unless the State has in effect not later than October 1, 1984, a client assistance program which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has the authority to pursue legal, administrative, and other appropriate remedies to ensure the protection of rights of individuals with disabilities who are receiving treatments, services, or rehabilitation under this chapter within the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) meets the requirements of designation under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Designation of agency to conduct program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Governor shall designate a public or private agency to conduct the client assistance <!-- PDFPage:225 -->program under this section. Except as provided in the last sentence of this paragraph, the Governor shall designate an agency which is independent of any agency which provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals under this chapter. If there is an agency in the State which has, or had, prior to February 22, 1984, served as a client assistance agency under this section and which received Federal financial assistance under this chapter, the Governor may, in the initial designation, designate an agency which provides treatment, services, or rehabilitation to individuals with disabilities under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Governor may not redesignate the agency designated under subparagraph (A) without good cause and unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Governor has given the agency 30 days notice of the intention to make such redesignation, including specification of the good cause for such redesignation and an opportunity to respond to the assertion that good cause has been shown;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) individuals with disabilities or their representatives have timely notice of the redesignation and opportunity for public comment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the agency has the opportunity to appeal to the Commissioner on the basis that the redesignation was not for good cause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out the provisions of this section, the Governor shall consult with the director of the State vocational rehabilitation agency, the head of the developmental disability protection and advocacy agency, and with representatives of professional and consumer organizations serving individuals with disabilities in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The agency designated under this subsection shall be accountable for the proper use of funds made available to the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purpose of this subsection, the term &ldquo;Governor&rdquo; means the chief executive of the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Class action by designated agency prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agency designated under subsection (c) of this section may not bring any class action in carrying out its responsibilities under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allotment and reallotment of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall allot the sums appropriated for each fiscal year under this section among the States on the basis of relative population of each State, except that no State shall receive less than $50,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall allot $30,000 each to American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau, except that the Republic of Palau may receive such allotment under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purpose of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not include American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) In any fiscal year that the funds appropriated for such fiscal year exceed $7,500,000, the minimum allotment shall be $100,000 for States and $45,000 for territories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For any fiscal year in which the total amount appropriated under subsection (h) of this section exceeds the total amount appropriated under such subsection for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments under clause (i) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of an allotment to a State for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required by the State during the period for which it is available for the purpose for which allotted shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary at appropriate times to other States with respect to which such a determination has not been made, in proportion to the original allotments of such States for such fiscal year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use during such period; and the total of such reduction shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any such amount so reallotted to a State for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of its allotment for such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as specifically prohibited by or as otherwise provided in State law, the Secretary shall pay to the agency designated under subsection (c) of this section the amount specified in the application approved under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Application by State for grant funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No grant may be made under this section unless the State submits an application to the Secretary at such time, in such manner, and containing or accompanied by such information as the Secretary deems necessary to meet the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Each program shall contain provisions designed to assure that to the maximum extent possible mediation procedures are used prior to resorting to administrative or legal remedies.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) States</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Population basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), from sums appropriated for each fiscal year to carry out this part (not including sums used in accordance with section 721(a)(34)(B) of this title), the Commissioner shall make an allotment to each State whose State plan has been approved under section 721 of this title of an amount bearing the same ratio to such sums as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the availability of appropriations to carry out this part, the allotment to any State under subparagraph (A) shall be not less than $200,000 or one-third of one percent of the sums made available for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, whichever is greater, and the allotment of any State under this section for any fiscal year that is less than $200,000 or one-third of one percent of such sums shall be increased to the greater of the two amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain territories</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of paragraph (1)(B), Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Republic of Palau shall not be considered to be States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each jurisdiction described in subparagraph (A) shall be allotted under paragraph (1)(A) not less than one-eighth of one percent of the amounts made available for purposes of this part for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made, except that the Republic of Palau may receive such allotment under this section only until the Compact of Free Association with Palau takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustment for inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year, beginning in fiscal year 1994, in which the total amount appropriated <!-- PDFPage:230 -->to carry out this part exceeds the total amount appropriated to carry out this part for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of this title, the Commissioner shall increase the minimum allotment under paragraph (1)(B) by such percentage change in the Consumer Price Index For All Urban Consumers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Proportional reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To provide minimum allotments to States (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, or to provide minimum allotments to States under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, the Commissioner shall proportionately reduce the allotments of the remaining States under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section, with such adjustments as may be necessary to prevent the allotment of any such remaining State from being reduced to less than the minimum allotment for a State (as increased under subsection (a)(3) of this section) under subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, or the minimum allotment for a State under subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner determines that any amount of an allotment to a State for any fiscal year will not be expended by such State for carrying out the provisions of this part, the Commissioner shall make such amount available for carrying out the purposes of this part to one or more of the States that the Commissioner determines will be able to use additional amounts during such year for carrying out such provisions. Any amount made available to a State for any fiscal year pursuant to the preceding sentence shall, for the purposes of this section, be regarded as an increase in the allotment of the State (as determined under the preceding provisions of this section) for such year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Governing bodies of Indian tribes; amount; non-Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner, in accordance with the provisions of this part, may make grants to the governing bodies of Indian tribes located on Federal and State reservations (and consortia of such governing bodies) to pay 90 percent of the costs of vocational rehabilitation services for American Indians who are individuals with disabilities residing on such reservations. The non-Federal share of such costs may be in cash or in kind, fairly valued, and the Commissioner may waive such non-Federal share requirement in order to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application; effective period; continuation of programs and services; separate service delivery systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No grant may be made under this part for any fiscal year unless an application therefor has been submitted to and approved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may not approve an application unless the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is made at such time, in such manner, and contains such information as the Commissioner may require;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) contains assurances that the rehabilitation services provided under this part to American Indians who are individuals with disabilities residing on a reservation in a State shall be, to the maximum extent feasible, comparable to rehabilitation services provided under this subchapter to other individuals with disabilities residing in the State and that, where appropriate, may include services traditionally used by Indian tribes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) contains assurances that the application was developed in consultation with the designated State unit of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The provisions of sections 450c, 450d, 450e, and 450f(a) of title 25 shall be applicable to any application submitted under this part.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any application approved under this part shall be effective for not less than twelve months or more than 36 months, except as determined otherwise by the Commissioner pursuant to prescribed regulations. The State shall continue to provide vocational rehabilitation services under its State plan to American Indians residing on a reservation whenever such State includes any such American Indians in its State population under section 730(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In making grants under this part, the Secretary shall give priority consideration to applications for the continuation of programs which have been funded under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing in this section may be construed to authorize a separate service delivery system for Indian residents of a State who reside in non-reservation areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Reservation&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;reservation&rdquo; includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, former Indian reservations in Oklahoma, and land held by incorporated Native groups, regional corporations, and village corporations under the provisions of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.].</p>
