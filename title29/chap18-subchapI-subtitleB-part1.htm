<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such carrier, organization, bank, institution, or plan sponsor shall transmit and certify the accuracy of such information to the administrator within 120 days after the end of the plan year (or such other date as may be prescribed under regulations of the Secretary).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), the administrator of an employee benefit plan shall engage, on behalf of all plan participants, an independent qualified public accountant, who shall conduct such an examination of any financial statements of the plan, and of other books and records of the plan, as the accountant may deem necessary to enable the accountant to form an opinion as to whether the financial statements and schedules required to be included in the annual reports by subsection (b) of this section are presented fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year. Such examination shall be conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, and shall involve such tests of the books and records of the plan as are considered necessary by the independent qualified public accountant. The independent qualified public accountant shall also offer his opinion as to whether the separate schedules specified in subsection (b)(3) of this section and the summary material required under section 1024(b)(3) of this title present fairly, and in all material respects the information contained therein when considered in conjunction with the financial statements taken as a whole. The opinion by the independent qualified public accountant shall be made a part of the annual report.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The administrator of an employee pension benefit plan subject to the reporting requirement of subsection (d) of this section shall engage, on behalf of all plan participants, an enrolled actuary who shall be responsible for the preparation of the materials comprising the actuarial statement required under subsection (d) of this section. In a case where a plan is not required to file an annual report, the requirement of this paragraph shall not apply, and, in a case where by reason of section 1024(a)(2) of this title, a plan is required only to file a simplified report, the Secretary may waive the requirement of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The enrolled actuary shall utilize such assumptions and techniques as are necessary to enable him to form an opinion as to whether the contents of the matters reported under subsection (d) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) are in the aggregate reasonably related to the experience of the plan and to reasonable expectations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) represent his best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The opinion by the enrolled actuary shall be made with respect to, and shall be made a part of, each annual report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;enrolled actuary&rdquo; means an actuary enrolled under subtitle C of subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
