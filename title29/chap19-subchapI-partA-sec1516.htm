<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is essential that criteria for measuring the return on this investment be developed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the basic return on the investment is to be measured by long-term economic self-sufficiency, increased employment and earnings, reductions in welfare dependency, and increased educational attainment and occupational skills.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subchapter II performance standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In prescribing performance standards for programs under parts A and C of subchapter II of this chapter, the Secretary shall ensure that States and service delivery areas will make efforts to increase services and positive outcomes for hard-to-serve individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Achievement of basic measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to determine whether the basic measures described in subsection (a) of this section are achieved for programs under parts A and C of subchapter II of this chapter, the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Education and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall prescribe performance standards.</p>
