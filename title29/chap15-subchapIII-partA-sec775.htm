<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment and operation; grants to designated State units; information and technical assistance to local governmental units and public and private nonprofit entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to provide a focal point in communities for the development and delivery of services designed primarily for individuals with disabilities, the Commissioner may make grants to any designated State unit to establish and operate comprehensive rehabilitation centers. The centers shall be established in order to provide a broad range of services to individuals with disabilities, including information and referral services, counseling services, and job placement, health, educational, social, and recreational services, as well as to provide facilities for recreational activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the maximum extent practicable, such centers shall provide, upon request, to local governmental units and other public and private nonprofit entities located in the area such information and technical assistance (including support personnel such as interpreters for individuals who are deaf) as may be necessary to assist those entities in complying with this chapter, particularly the requirements of section 794 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application for grant; approval by Commissioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No grant may be made under this section unless an application therefor has been submitted to and approved by the Commissioner. The Commissioner may not approve an application for a grant unless the application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) contains assurances that the designated State unit will use funds provided by such grant in accordance with subsections (c) and (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contains such other information, and is submitted in such form and in accordance with such procedures, as the Commissioner may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Grants or contracts by designated State unit; operation of facilities by designated State unit; personnel and equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The designated State unit may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in accordance with subsection (c) of this section make grants to units of general purpose local government or to other public or nonprofit private agencies or organizations and may make contracts with any agency or organization to pay not to exceed 80 percent of the cost of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) leasing facilities to serve as comprehensive rehabilitation centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) expanding, remodeling, or altering facilities to the extent necessary to adapt them to serve as comprehensive rehabilitation centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) operating such centers; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) carrying out any combination of the activities specified in this subparagraph; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) directly carry out the activities described in subparagraph (A), except that not more than 80 percent of the costs of providing any comprehensive rehabilitation center may be provided from funds under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds made available to any designated State unit under this section for the purpose of assisting in the operation of a comprehensive rehabilitation center may be used to compensate professional and technical personnel required to operate the center and to deliver services in the center, and to provide equipment for the center.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application requirements for approval of grant or contract by designated State unit; use of funds by designated State unit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The designated State unit may approve a grant or enter into a contract under subsection (c) of this section only if the application for such grant or contract meets the requirements specified in paragraphs (1), (2), (4), and (5) of section 776(b) of this title and if the application contains assurances that any center assisted by such grant or contract shall be in reasonably close proximity to the majority of individuals eligible to use the comprehensive rehabilitation center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any designated State unit which directly provides for comprehensive rehabilitation centers under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section shall use funds under this section in the same manner as any other grant recipient is required to use such funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Failure of owner or facility to continue to qualify; recovery by United States; determination of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If within 20 years after the completion of any construction project for which funds have been paid under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the owner of the facility ceases to be a public or nonprofit private agency or organization, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the facility ceases to be used for the purposes for which it was leased or constructed (unless the Commissioner determines, in accordance with regulations, that there is good cause for releasing the applicant or other owner from the obligation to do so),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the United States shall be entitled to recover from the grant recipient or other owner of the facility an amount which bears the same ratio to the value of the facility (or so much thereof as constituted an approved project or projects) at the time the United States seeks recovery as the amount of such Federal funds bore to the cost of renovating the facility under subsection (c)(1)(A)(ii) of this section. Such value shall be determined by agreement of the parties or by action brought in the United States district court for the district in which such facility is situated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nonapplicability of general contract and grant requirements; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The requirements of section 776 of this title shall not apply to funds allotted under this section, except that subsections (g) and (h) of such section shall be applicable with respect to such funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 1993 through 1997.</p>
