<p class="note-body">Pursuant to an order of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia (<em>Kennedy v.

Therefore, for purposes of codification, this chapter should be deemed to have been amended by Pub. L. 93&ndash;651, Nov. 21, 1974, 89 Stat. 2&ndash;3, in exactly the same manner as it was amended by Pub. L. 93&ndash;516, Dec. 7, 1974, 88 Stat. 1617.</p>
