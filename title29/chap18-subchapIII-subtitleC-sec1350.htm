<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan administrator satisfies section 1341(b)(3)(A) of this title in the case of a missing participant only if the plan administrator&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of transferred assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A transfer to the corporation under this section shall be treated as a transfer of assets from a terminated plan to the corporation as trustee, and shall be held with assets of terminated plans for which the corporation is trustee under section 1342 of this title, subject to the rules set forth in that section.</p>
