<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Actuarial projections of assets and liabilities</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In making the determinations and projections under this subsection, the plan actuary shall make projections required for the current and succeeding plan years of the current value of the assets of the plan and the present value of all liabilities to participants and beneficiaries under the plan for the current plan year as of the beginning of such year. The actuary's projections shall be based on reasonable actuarial estimates, assumptions, and methods that, except as provided in clause (iii), offer the actuary's best estimate of anticipated experience under the plan. The projected present value of liabilities as of the beginning of such year shall be determined based on the most recent of either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the actuarial statement required under section 1023(d) of this title with respect to the most recently filed annual report, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the actuarial valuation for the preceding plan year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any actuarial projection of plan assets shall assume&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) reasonably anticipated employer contributions for the current and succeeding plan years, assuming that the terms of the one or more collective bargaining agreements pursuant to which the plan is maintained for the current plan year continue in effect for succeeding plan years, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) that employer contributions for the most recent plan year will continue indefinitely, but only if the plan actuary determines there have been no significant demographic changes that would make such assumption unreasonable.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Projected industry activity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any projection of activity in the industry or industries covered by the plan, including future covered employment and contribution levels, shall be based on information provided by the plan sponsor, which shall act reasonably and in good faith.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Penalty for failure to secure timely actuarial certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any failure of the plan's actuary to certify the plan's status under this subsection by the date specified in subparagraph (A) shall be treated for purposes of section 1132(c)(2) of this title as a failure or refusal by the plan administrator to file the annual report required to be filed with the Secretary under section 1021(b)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Notice</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which it is certified under subparagraph (A) that a multiemployer plan is or will be in endangered or critical status for a plan year, the plan sponsor shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the certification, provide notification of the endangered or critical status to the participants and beneficiaries, the bargaining parties, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, and the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Plans in critical status</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If it is certified under subparagraph (A) that a multiemployer plan is or will be in critical status, the plan sponsor shall include in the notice under clause (i) an explanation of the possibility that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) adjustable benefits (as defined in subsection (e)(8)) may be reduced, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such reductions may apply to participants and beneficiaries whose benefit commencement date is on or after the date such notice is provided for the first plan year in which the plan is in critical status.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Model notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the Secretary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1085_1_target" name="1085_1">1</a></sup> shall prescribe a model notice that a multiemployer plan may use to satisfy the requirements under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funding improvement plan must be adopted for multiemployer plans in endangered status</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which a multiemployer plan is in endangered status for a plan year, the plan sponsor, in accordance with this subsection&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception for years after process begins</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a plan year if such year is in a funding plan adoption period or funding improvement period by reason of the plan being in endangered status for a preceding plan year.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The funding improvement period for any funding improvement plan adopted pursuant to this subsection is the 10-year period beginning on the first day of the first plan year of the multiemployer plan beginning after the earlier of&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Plans in endangered status at end of period</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The schedule or schedules described in subparagraph (B)(i) shall reflect reductions in future benefit accruals and adjustable benefits, and increases in contributions, that the plan sponsor determines are reasonably necessary to emerge from critical status.
