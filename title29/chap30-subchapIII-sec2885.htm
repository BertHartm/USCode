<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) obtaining from each applicant pertinent data relating to background, needs, and interests for determining eligibility and potential assignment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) where appropriate, take measures to improve the professional capability of the individuals conducting screening of the applicants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) assure that an appropriate number of enrollees are from rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Implementation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Special limitations on selection</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No individual shall be selected as an enrollee unless the individual or organization implementing the standards and procedures described in subsection (a) of this section determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is a reasonable expectation that the individual considered for selection can participate successfully in group situations and activities, and is not likely to engage in <!-- PDFPage:781 -->behavior that would prevent other enrollees from receiving the benefit of the Job Corps program or be incompatible with the maintenance of sound discipline and satisfactory relationships between the Job Corps center to which the individual might be assigned and communities surrounding the Job Corps center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the individual manifests a basic understanding of both the rules to which the individual will be subject and of the consequences of failure to observe the rules; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the individual has passed a background check conducted in accordance with procedures established by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Individuals on probation, parole, or supervised release</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual on probation, parole, or supervised release may be selected as an enrollee only if release from the supervision of the probation or parole official involved is satisfactory to the official and the Secretary and does not violate applicable laws (including regulations). No individual shall be denied a position in the Job Corps solely on the basis of individual contact with the criminal justice system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assignment plan</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Every 2 years, the Secretary shall develop and implement an assignment plan for assigning enrollees to Job Corps centers. In developing the plan, the Secretary shall, based on the analysis described in paragraph (2), establish targets, applicable to each Job Corps center, for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the maximum attainable percentage of enrollees at the Job Corps center that reside in the State in which the center is located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the maximum attainable percentage of enrollees at the Job Corps center that reside in the region in which the center is located, and in surrounding regions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Analysis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to develop the plan described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, every 2 years, analyze, for the Job Corps center&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After an individual has been selected for the Job Corps in accordance with the standards and procedures of the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section, the enrollee shall be assigned to the Job Corps center that is closest to the home of the enrollee, except that the Secretary may waive this requirement if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the enrollee chooses a vocational training program, or requires an English literacy program, that is not available at such center;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the enrollee would be unduly delayed in participating in the Job Corps program because the closest center is operating at full capacity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the parent or guardian of the enrollee requests assignment of the enrollee to another Job Corps center due to circumstances in the community of the enrollee that would impair prospects for successful participation in the Job Corps program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Enrollees who are younger than 18</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An enrollee who is younger than 18 shall not be assigned to a Job Corps center other than the center closest to the home of the enrollee pursuant to paragraph (1) if the parent or guardian of the enrollee objects to the assignment.</p>
