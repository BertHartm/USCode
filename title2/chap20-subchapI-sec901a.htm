<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Allocation to functions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On January 2, 2013, for fiscal year 2013, and in its sequestration preview report for fiscal years 2014 through 2021 pursuant to section 904(c) of this title, OMB shall allocate half of the total reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) for that year to discretionary appropriations and direct spending accounts within function 050 (defense function) and half to accounts in all other functions (nondefense functions).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Defense function reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">OMB shall calculate the reductions to discretionary appropriations and direct spending for each of fiscal years 2013 through 2021 for defense function spending as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Discretionary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">OMB shall calculate the reduction to discretionary appropriations by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) taking the total reduction for the defense function allocated for that year under paragraph (4);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) multiplying by the discretionary spending limit for the revised security category for that year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) dividing by the sum of the discretionary spending limit for the security category and OMB's baseline estimate of nonexempt outlays for direct spending programs within the defense function for that year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Direct spending</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">OMB shall calculate the reduction to direct spending by taking the total reduction for the defense function required for that year under paragraph (4) and subtracting the discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Nondefense function reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">OMB shall calculate the reduction to discretionary appropriations and to direct spending for each of fiscal years 2013 through 2021 for programs in nondefense functions as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Discretionary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">OMB shall calculate the reduction to discretionary appropriations by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) taking the total reduction for nondefense functions allocated for that year under paragraph (4);</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Fiscal year 2013</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On January 2, 2013, for fiscal year 2013, OMB shall calculate and the President shall order a sequestration, effective upon issuance and under the procedures set forth in section 903(f) of this title, to reduce each account within the security category or nonsecurity category by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of budgetary resources in that account at that time by a uniform percentage necessary to achieve&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for the revised security category, an amount equal to the defense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (5); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for the revised nonsecurity category, an amount equal to the nondefense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (6).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Fiscal years 2014&ndash;2021</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On the date of the submission of its sequestration preview report for fiscal years 2014 through 2021 pursuant to section 904(c) of this title for each of fiscal years 2014 through 2021, OMB shall reduce the discretionary spending limit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for the revised security category by the amount of the defense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (5); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for the revised nonsecurity category by the amount of the nondefense function discretionary reduction calculated pursuant to paragraph (6).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Implementing direct spending reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On the date specified in paragraph (4) during each applicable year, OMB shall prepare and the President shall order a sequestration, effective upon issuance, of nonexempt direct spending to achieve the direct spending reduction calculated pursuant to paragraphs (5) and (6). When implementing the sequestration of direct spending pursuant to this paragraph, OMB shall follow the procedures specified in section 935 of this title, the exemptions specified in section 905 of this title, and the special rules specified in section 906 of this title, ex<!-- PDFPage:409 -->cept that the percentage reduction for the Medicare programs specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be more than 2 percent for a fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Adjustment for Medicare</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the percentage reduction for the Medicare programs would exceed 2 percent for a fiscal year in the absence of paragraph (8), OMB shall increase the reduction for all other discretionary appropriations and direct spending under paragraph (6) by a uniform percentage to a level sufficient to achieve the reduction required by paragraph (6) in the non-defense function.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Implementation of reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any reductions imposed under this section shall be implemented in accordance with section 906(k) of this title.</p>
