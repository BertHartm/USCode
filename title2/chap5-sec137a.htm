<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Heretofore the Joint Committee on the Library has had authority to approve such rules and regulations as have been made by the Librarian of Congress, but the provision of law under which the Joint Committee has hitherto passed upon said rules and regulations would appear to be repealed by the more recent act (section 136 of this title) which places this power in the hands of the Librarian of Congress.&rdquo;</p>
