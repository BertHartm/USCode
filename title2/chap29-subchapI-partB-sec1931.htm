<p class="statutory-body">The Chief of the Capitol Police may establish and determine, from time to time, positions in salary classes of employees of the Capitol Police to be designated as employees with specialty assignments or proficiencies, based on the experience, education, training, or other appropriate factors required to carry out the duties of such employees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such amount may not be paid in a calendar year to the extent that, when added to the total basic pay paid or payable to such employee for service performed in the year, such amount would cause the total to exceed the annual rate of basic pay payable for level II of the Executive Schedule, as of the end of such year.</p>
