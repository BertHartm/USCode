The former Chief Administrative Officer or his estate shall not be subject to any legal liability or penalty for the official acts and defaults of such disbursing clerk acting in the name or in the place of the former Chief Administrative Officer under this section, but such disbursing clerk shall be responsible therefor. The accounts and payments referred to in the second sentence shall be audited by the Inspector General of the House of Representatives.</p>
