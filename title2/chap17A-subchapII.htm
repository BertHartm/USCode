<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal intergovernmental mandates in reported bills and resolutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each bill or joint resolution of a public character reported by any committee of authorization of the Senate or the House of Representatives, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office shall prepare and submit to the committee a statement as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Director estimates that the direct cost of all Federal intergovernmental mandates in the bill or joint resolution will equal or exceed $50,000,000 (adjusted annually for inflation) in the fiscal year in which any Federal intergovernmental mandate in the bill or joint resolution (or in any necessary implementing regulation) would first be effective or in any of the 4 fiscal years following such fiscal year, the Director shall so state, specify the estimate, and briefly explain the basis of the estimate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Estimates</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Additional flexibility information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall include in the statement submitted under this subsection, in the case of legislation that makes changes as described in section 658(5)(B)(i)(II) of this title&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Estimate not feasible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Director determines that it is not feasible to make a reasonable estimate that would be required under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Director shall not make the estimate, but shall report in the statement that the reasonable estimate cannot be made and shall include the reasons for that determination in the statement. If such determination is made by the Director, a point of order under this part shall lie only under section 658d(a)(1) of this title and as if the requirement of section 658d(a)(1) of this title had not been met.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Estimate not feasible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Director determines that it is not feasible to make a reasonable estimate that would be required under paragraphs (1) and (2), the Director shall not make the estimate, but shall report in the statement that the reasonable estimate cannot be made and shall include the reasons for that determination in the statement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Legislation falling below direct costs thresholds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Director estimates that the direct costs of a Federal mandate will not equal or exceed the thresholds specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the Director shall so state and shall briefly explain the basis of the estimate.</p>
