<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established in the Treasury of the United States a trust fund to be known as the &ldquo;John C. Stennis Center for Public Service Development Trust Fund&rdquo;. The fund shall consist of amounts appropriated to it pursuant to section 1110 of this title and amounts credited to it under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investment of fund assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to invest in full the amounts appropriated to the fund. Such investments may be made only in interest bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose, such obligations may be acquired on original issue at the issue price or by purchase of outstanding obligations at the marketplace.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of special obligations exclusively to the fund. Such special obligations shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average rate of interest, computed as to the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue, borne by all marketable interest bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt, except that when such average rate is not a multiple of one-eighth of one per<!-- PDFPage:415 -->cent, the rate of interest of such special obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of one percent next lower than such average rate. Such special obligations shall be issued only if the Secretary determines that the purchase of other interest bearing obligations of the United States, or of obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States or original issue or at the market price, is not in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority to sell obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any obligation acquired by the fund (except special obligations issued exclusively to the fund) may be sold by the Secretary of the Treasury at the market price, and such special obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Proceeds from certain transactions credited to fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the appropriations received pursuant to section 1110 of this title, the interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the fund pursuant to section 1108(a) of this title, shall be credited to and form a part of the fund.</p>
