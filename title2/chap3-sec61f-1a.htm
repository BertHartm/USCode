The receipt of any such sum so advanced to the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper or to any designated employee shall be taken and passed by the accounting officers of the Government as a full and sufficient voucher; but it shall be the duty of the traveler, as soon as practicable, to furnish to the Secretary of the Senate a detailed voucher of the expenses incurred for the travel with respect to which the sum was so advanced, and make settlement with respect to such sum. Payments under this section shall be made from funds included in the appropriations account, within the contingent fund of the Senate, for the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper of the Senate, upon vouchers approved by the Sergeant at Arms and Doorkeeper.</p>

L. 100&ndash;458, which directed the substitution of &ldquo;not to exceed $250,000 during any fiscal year&rdquo; for &ldquo;not to exceed $167,000 during any fiscal year&rdquo; was executed by making the substitution for &ldquo;not exceeding $167,000 during any fiscal year&rdquo; as the probable intent of Congress because of absence of &ldquo;not to exceed&rdquo; in text.</p>
