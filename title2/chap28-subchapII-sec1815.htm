<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Architect of the Capitol&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall develop and implement a cost-effective energy conservation strategy for all facilities currently administered by Congress to achieve a net reduction of 20 percent in energy consumption on the congressional campus compared to fiscal year 1991 consumption levels on a Btu-per-gross-square-foot basis not later than 7 years after October 21, 1998;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall submit to Congress no later than 10 months after October 21, 1998, a comprehensive energy conservation and management plan which includes life cycle costs methods to determine the cost-effectiveness of proposed energy efficiency projects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall submit to the Committee on Appropriations in the Senate and the House of Representatives a request for the amount of appropriations necessary to carry out this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) shall present to Congress annually a report on congressional energy management and conservation programs which details energy expenditures for each facility, energy management and conservation projects, and future priorities to ensure compliance with the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) shall perform energy surveys of all congressional buildings and update such surveys as needed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) shall use such surveys to determine the cost and payback period of energy and water conservation measures likely to achieve the required energy consumption levels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) shall install energy and water conservation measures that will achieve the requirements through previously determined life cycle cost methods and procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) may contract with nongovernmental entities and employ private sector capital to finance energy conservation projects and achieve energy consumption targets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) may develop innovative contracting methods that will attract private sector funding for the installation of energy-efficient and renewable energy technology to meet the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) may participate in the Department of Energy's Financing Renewable Energy and Efficiency (FREE Savings) contracts program for Federal Government facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) shall produce information packages and &ldquo;how-to&rdquo; guides for each Member and employing authority of the Congress that detail simple, cost-effective methods to save energy and taxpayer dollars.</p>
