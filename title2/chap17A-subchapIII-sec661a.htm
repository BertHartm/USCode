<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The cost of a modification is the difference between the current estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of a direct loan or loan guarantee contract, and the current estimate of the net present value of the remaining cash flows under the terms of the contract, as modified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) In estimating net present values, the discount rate shall be the average interest rate on marketable Treasury securities of similar maturity to the cash flows of the direct loan or loan guarantee for which the estimate is being made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) When funds are obligated for a direct loan or loan guarantee, the estimated cost shall be based on the current assumptions, adjusted to incorporate the terms of the loan contract, for the fiscal year in which the funds are obligated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The term &ldquo;credit program account&rdquo; means the budget account into which an appropriation to cover the cost of a direct loan or loan guarantee program is made and from which such cost is disbursed to the financing account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The term &ldquo;modification&rdquo; means any Government action that alters the estimated cost of an outstanding direct loan (or direct loan obligation) or an outstanding loan guarantee (or loan guarantee commitment) from the current estimate of cash flows. This includes the sale of loan assets, with or without recourse, and the purchase of guaranteed loans. This also includes any action resulting from new legislation, or from the exercise of administrative discretion under existing law, that directly or indirectly alters the estimated cost of outstanding direct loans (or direct loan obligations) or loan guarantees (or loan guarantee commitments) such as a change in collection procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The term &ldquo;current&rdquo; has the same meaning as in section 900(c)(9) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The term &ldquo;Director&rdquo; means the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
