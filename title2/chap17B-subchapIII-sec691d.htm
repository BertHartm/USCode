<h3 class="section-head">&sect;691d. Expedited congressional consideration of disapproval bills</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Receipt and referral of special message</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each special message transmitted under this subchapter shall be referred to the Committee on the Budget and the appropriate committee or committees of the Senate and the Committee on the Budget and the appropriate committee or committees of the House of Representatives. Each such message shall be printed as a document of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Time period for expedited procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There shall be a congressional review period of 30 calendar days of session, beginning on the first calendar day of session after the date on which the special message is received in the House of Representatives and the Senate, during which the procedures contained in this section shall apply to both Houses of Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the House of Representatives the procedures set forth in this section shall not apply after the end of the period described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If Congress adjourns at the end of a Congress prior to the expiration of the period described in paragraph (1) and a disapproval bill was then pending in either House of Congress or a committee thereof (including a conference committee of the two Houses of Congress), or was pending before the President, a disapproval bill for the same special message may be introduced within the first five calendar days of session of the next Congress and shall be treated as a disapproval bill under this subchapter, and the time period described in paragraph (1) shall commence on the day of introduction of that disapproval bill.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Introduction of disapproval bills</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order for a disapproval bill to be considered under the procedures set forth in this section, the bill must meet the definition of a disapproval bill and must be introduced no later than the fifth calendar day of session following the beginning of the period described in subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a disapproval bill introduced in the House of Representatives, such bill shall include in the first blank space referred to in section 691e(6)(C) of this title a list of the reference numbers for all cancellations made by the President in the special message to which such disapproval bill relates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consideration in House of Representatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any committee of the House of Representatives to which a disapproval bill is referred shall report it without amendment, and with or without recommendation, not later than the seventh calendar day of session after the date of its introduction. If any committee fails to report the bill within that period, it is in order to move that the House discharge the committee from further consideration of the bill, except that such a motion may not be made after the committee has reported a disapproval bill with respect to the same special message. A motion to discharge may be made only by a Member favoring the bill (but only at a time or place designated by the Speaker in the legislative schedule of the day after the calendar day on which the Member offering the motion announces to the House his intention to do so and the form of the motion). The motion is highly privileged. Debate thereon shall be limited to not more than one hour, the time to be divided in the House equally between a proponent and an opponent. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without intervening motion. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After a disapproval bill is reported or a committee has been discharged from further consideration, it is in order to move that the House resolve into the Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for consideration of the bill. If reported and the report has been available for at least one calendar day, all points of order against the bill and against consideration of the bill are waived. If discharged, all points of order against the bill and against consideration of the bill are waived. The motion is highly privileged. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. During consideration of the bill in the Committee of the Whole, the first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. General debate shall proceed, shall be confined to the bill, and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by a proponent and an opponent of the bill. The bill shall be considered as read for amendment under the five-minute rule. Only one motion to rise shall be in order, except if offered by the manager. No amendment to the bill is in order, except any Member if supported by 49 other Members (a quorum being present) may offer an amendment striking the reference number or numbers of a cancellation or cancellations from the bill. Consideration of the bill for amendment shall not exceed one hour excluding time for recorded <!-- PDFPage:351 -->votes and quorum calls. No amendment shall be subject to further amendment, except pro forma amendments for the purposes of debate only. At the conclusion of the consideration of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion. A motion to reconsider the vote on passage of the bill shall not be in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Appeals from decisions of the Chair regarding application of the rules of the House of Representatives to the procedure relating to a disapproval bill shall be decided without debate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) It shall not be in order to consider under this subsection more than one disapproval bill for the same special message except for consideration of a similar Senate bill (unless the House has already rejected a disapproval bill for the same special message) or more than one motion to discharge described in paragraph (1) with respect to a disapproval bill for that special message.</p>

If any committee fails to report the bill within that period, that committee shall be automatically discharged from further consideration of the bill and the bill shall be placed on the Calendar.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to sustain an appeal of the ruling of the Chair on a point of order raised under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Motion nondebatable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A motion to proceed to consideration of a disapproval bill under this subsection shall not be debatable.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Limit on consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) After no more than 10 hours of consideration of a disapproval bill, the Senate shall proceed, without intervening action or debate (except as permitted under paragraph (9)), to vote on the final disposition thereof to the exclusion of all amendments not then pending and to the exclusion of all motions, except a motion to reconsider or to table.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Debate on amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Debate on any amendment to a disapproval bill shall be limited to one hour, equally divided and controlled by the Senator proposing the amendment and the majority manager, unless the majority manager is in favor of the amendment, in which case the minority manager shall be in control of the time in opposition.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) No motion to recommit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A motion to recommit a disapproval bill shall not be in order.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Disposition of Senate disapproval bill</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Senate has read for the third time a disapproval bill that originated in the Senate, then it shall be in order at any time thereafter to move to proceed to the consideration of a disapproval bill for the same special message received from the House of Representatives and placed on the Calendar pursuant to paragraph (2), strike all after the enacting clause, substitute the text of the Senate disapproval bill, agree to the Senate amendment, and vote on final disposition of the House disapproval bill, all without any intervening action or debate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Consideration of House message</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Convening of conference</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) House consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other rule of the House of Representatives, it shall be in order to consider the report of a committee of conference relating to a disapproval bill provided such report has been available for one calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, or legal holidays, unless the House is in session on such a day) and the accompanying statement shall have been filed in the House.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Debate in the House of Representatives on the conference report and any amendments in disagreement on any disapproval bill shall each be limited to not more than one hour equally divided and controlled by a proponent and an opponent. A motion to further limit debate is not debatable. A motion to recommit the conference report is not in order, and it is not in order to move to reconsider the vote by which the conference report is agreed to or disagreed to.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Senate consideration</h4>
