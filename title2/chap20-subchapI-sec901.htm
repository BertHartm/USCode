<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 902 of this title and section 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-year breach, if any, within any category.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eliminating a breach</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category; except that the health programs set forth in section 906(e) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to eliminate that breach. If, within a category, the discretionary spending limits for both new budget authority and outlays are breached, the uniform percentage shall be calculated by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, calculating the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate the breach in new budget authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, if any breach in outlays remains, increasing the uniform percentage to a level sufficient to eliminate that breach.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Military personnel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President uses the authority to exempt any military personnel from sequestration under section 905(f) of this title, each account within subfunctional category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts for which the authority provided under section 905(f) of this title has been exercised) shall be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the use of such authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Part-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the date specified in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Look-back</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts within that category), the discretionary spending limits for that category for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Within-session sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach <!-- PDFPage:406 -->within a category for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts within that category), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within that category following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) through (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Estimates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) CBO estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any discretionary appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legislation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) OMB estimates and explanation of differences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date of enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing the CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the 2 estimates. If during the preparation of the report OMB determines that there is a significant difference between OMB and CBO, OMB shall consult with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate regarding that difference and that consultation shall include, to extent practicable, written communication to those committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before the issuance of the report.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Assumptions and guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">OMB estimates under this paragraph shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Annual appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations shall include any new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year in accounts for which funding is provided in that legislation that result from previously enacted legislation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to discretionary spending limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Preview report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Concepts and definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When the President submits the budget under section 1105 of title 31, OMB shall calculate and the budget shall include adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as cumulatively adjusted) for the budget year and each outyear to reflect changes in concepts and definitions. Such changes shall equal the baseline levels of new budget authority and outlays using up-to-date concepts and definitions minus those levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before such changes. Such changes may only be made after consultation with the committees&nbsp;<sup><a href="#901_1_target" name="901_1">1</a></sup> on Appropriations and the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate and that consultation shall include written communication to such committees that affords such committees the opportunity to comment before official action is taken with respect to such changes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(bb) OMB shall take the current estimate of highway receipts for the current year and subtract the estimated level of receipts for that year.</p>

After making the calculations under the preceding sentence, OMB shall adjust the amount of obligations set forth in that section for the budget year and the first outyear by adding one-half of the sum of the amount calculated under items (aa) and (bb) to each such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) The estimated level of highway receipts for the purposes of this clause are&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:407 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the outlays for the applicable category calculated assuming obligation levels consistent with the estimates prepared pursuant to subparagraph (D), as adjusted, using current technical assumptions; minus</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) When OMB and CBO submit their final sequester report for fiscal year 2006, that report shall include an estimate of the outlays for each of the categories that would result in fiscal years 2007 through 2010 from obligations at the levels specified in section 8003 of the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users using current assumptions.</p>
