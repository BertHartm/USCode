<p class="note-body">Section 112h of this title, referred to in subsec. (e), was in the original &ldquo;section 103 of the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2005&rdquo; and was translated as reading &ldquo;section 102&rdquo; of that Act, meaning section 102 of div. G of Pub. L. 108&ndash;447, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 103 of div. G of Pub. L. 108&ndash;447 does not relate to the Net Expenses of Telecommunications Revolving Fund.</p>
