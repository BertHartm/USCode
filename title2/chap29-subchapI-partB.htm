<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recruitment and relocation bonuses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorization of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Capitol Police Board (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) may authorize the Chief of the United States Capitol Police (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Chief&rdquo;) to pay a bonus to an individual who is newly appointed to a position as an officer or employee of the Capitol Police, and to pay an additional bonus to an individual who must relocate to accept a position as an officer or employee of the Capitol Police, if the Board determines that the Capitol Police would be likely, in the absence of such a bonus, to encounter difficulty in filling the position.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of a bonus under this subsection shall be determined by regulations of the Board, but the amount of any bonus paid to an individual under this subsection may not exceed 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the position to which the individual is being appointed.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Bonus not considered part of basic pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A bonus under this subsection shall be paid as a lump sum, and may not be considered to <!-- PDFPage:519 -->be part of the basic pay of the officer or employee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Payment permitted prior to commencement of duty</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorization of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may authorize the Chief to pay an allowance to an officer or employee of the United States Capitol Police if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the unusually high or unique qualifications of the officer or employee or a special need of the Capitol Police for the officer's or employee's services makes it essential to retain the officer or employee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Chief determines that the officer or employee would be likely to leave in the absence of a retention allowance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A retention allowance, which shall be stated as a percentage of the rate of basic pay of the officer or employee, may not exceed 25 percent of such rate of basic pay.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment not considered part of basic pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A retention allowance may not be considered to be part of the basic pay of an officer or employee, and the reduction or elimination of a retention allowance may not be appealed.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Time and manner of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A retention allowance under this subsection shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as the officer's or employee's basic pay is paid.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon the approval of the Chief&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an officer of the United States Capitol Police in a service step who has demonstrated meritorious service (in accordance with criteria established by the Chief or the Chief's designee) may be advanced in compensation to the next higher service step, effective with the first pay period which begins after the date of the Chief's approval; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an officer of the United States Capitol Police in a service step who has demonstrated extraordinary performance (in accordance with criteria established by the Chief or the Chief's designee) may be advanced in compensation to the second next higher service step, effective with the first pay period which begins after the date of the Chief's approval.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Manner of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The additional compensation authorized by this subsection shall be paid to the officer in the same manner as the officer is paid basic compensation, except that when the officer ceases to be assigned to duty as a field training officer, the loss of such additional compensation shall not constitute an adverse action for any purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The payment of bonuses, allowances, step increases, compensation, and other payments pursuant to this section shall be carried out in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board.</p>
