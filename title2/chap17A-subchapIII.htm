<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appropriations required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, new direct loan obligations may be incurred and new loan guarantee commitments may be made for fiscal year 1992 and thereafter only to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) appropriations of budget authority to cover their costs are made in advance;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Budget accounting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The authority to incur new direct loan obligations, make new loan guarantee commitments, or directly or indirectly alter the costs of outstanding direct loans and loan guarantees shall constitute new budget authority in an amount equal to the cost of the direct loan or loan guarantee in the fiscal year in which definite authority becomes available or indefinite authority is used. Such budget authority shall constitute an obligation of the credit program account to pay to the financing account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The outlays resulting from new budget authority for the cost of direct loans or loan guarantees described in paragraph (1) shall be paid from the credit program account into the financing account and recorded in the fiscal year in which the direct loan or the guaranteed loan is disbursed or its costs altered.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Modifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A direct loan obligation or loan guarantee commitment shall not be modified in a manner that increases its cost unless budget authority for the additional cost is appropriated, or is available out of existing appropriations or from other budgetary resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reestimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the estimated cost for a group of direct loans or loan guarantees for a given credit program made in a single fiscal year is reestimated in a subsequent year, the difference between the reestimated cost and the previous cost estimate shall be displayed as a distinct and separately identified subaccount in the credit program account as a change in program costs and a change in net interest. There is hereby provided permanent indefinite authority for these reestimates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Administrative expenses</h4>
