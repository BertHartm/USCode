<h3 class="section-head">&sect;901. Enforcing discretionary spending limits</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Fiscal years 1991&ndash;1998 enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 902 of this title and section 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to eliminate a budget-year breach, if any, within any category.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eliminating a breach</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each non-exempt account within a category shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the baseline level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate a breach within that category; except that the health programs set forth in section 906(e) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to eliminate that breach. If, within a category, the discretionary spending limits for both new budget authority and outlays are breached, the uniform percentage shall be calculated by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) first, calculating the uniform percentage necessary to eliminate the breach in new budget authority, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) second, if any breach in outlays remains, increasing the uniform percentage to a level sufficient to eliminate that breach.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Military personnel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President uses the authority to exempt any military personnel from sequestration under section 905(h) of this title, each account within subfunctional category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts for which the authority provided under section 905(h) of this title has been exercised) shall be further reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which outlays are not reduced in military personnel accounts by reason of the use of such authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Part-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the date specified in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Look-back</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts within that category), the discre<!-- PDFPage:350 -->tionary spending limits for that category for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Within-session sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an appropriation for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress adjourns to end the session for that budget year and before July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach within a category for that year (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts within that category), 15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that breach within that category following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) through (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) OMB estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any discretionary appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legislation. Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing the CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget authority and outlays for the current year (if any) and the budget year provided by that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the two estimates. For purposes of this paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations shall include any new budget authority and outlays for those years in accounts for which funding is provided in that legislation that result from previously enacted legislation. Those OMB estimates shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the OMB estimates transmitted to the Congress under this paragraph for the purposes of this subsection. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustments to discretionary spending limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When the President submits the budget under section 1105(a) of title 31 for budget year 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998 (except as otherwise indicated), OMB shall calculate (in the order set forth below), and the budget shall include, adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as cumulatively adjusted) for the budget year and each outyear through 1998 to reflect the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) Changes in concepts and definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The adjustments produced by the amendments made by title XIII of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990 or by any other changes in concepts and definitions shall equal the baseline levels of new budget authority and outlays using up-to-date concepts and definitions minus those levels using the concepts and definitions in effect before such changes. Such other changes in concepts and definitions may only be made in consultation with the Committees on Appropriations, the Budget, Government Operations, and Governmental Affairs of the House of Representatives and Senate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Changes in inflation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) For a budget submitted for budget year 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995, the adjustments produced by changes in inflation shall equal the levels of discretionary new budget authority and outlays in the baseline (calculated using current estimates) subtracted from those levels in that baseline recalculated with the baseline inflators for the budget year only, multiplied by the inflation adjustment factor computed under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For a budget year the inflation adjustment factor shall equal the ratio between the level of year-over-year inflation measured for the fiscal year most recently completed and the applicable estimated level for that year set forth below:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For 1990, 1.041</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For 1991, 1.052</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For 1992, 1.041</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For 1993, 1.033</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Inflation shall be measured by the average of the estimated gross national product implicit price deflator index for a fiscal year divided by the average index for the prior fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) For a budget submitted for budget year 1996, 1997, or 1998, the adjustments shall be those necessary to reflect changes in inflation estimates since those of March 31, 1993, set forth on page 46 of House Conference Report 103&ndash;48.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) Credit reestimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For a budget submitted for fiscal year 1993 or 1994, the adjustments produced by reestimates to costs of Federal credit programs shall be, for any such program, a current estimate of new budget authority and outlays associated with a baseline projection of the prior year's gross loan level for that program minus the baseline projection of the prior year's new budget authority and associated outlays for that program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When OMB submits a sequestration report under section 904(g) or (h) of this title for fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, or 1998 (except as otherwise indicated), OMB shall calculate (in the order set forth below), and the sequestration report, and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 1105(a) of title 31, shall include, adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits as adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding year through 1998, as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) IRS funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that appropriations are enacted that provide additional new budget authority or result in additional outlays (as compared with the CBO baseline constructed in June 1990) for the Internal Revenue Service compliance initiative in any fiscal year, the adjustments for that year shall be those <!-- PDFPage:351 -->amounts, but shall not exceed the amounts set forth below&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for fiscal year 1991, $191,000,000 in new budget authority and $183,000,000 in outlays;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for fiscal year 1992, $172,000,000 in new budget authority and $169,000,000 in outlays;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) for fiscal year 1993, $183,000,000 in new budget authority and $179,000,000 in outlays;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) for fiscal year 1994, $187,000,000 in new budget authority and $183,000,000 in outlays; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) for fiscal year 1995, $188,000,000 in new budget authority and $184,000,000 in outlays; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the prior-year outlays resulting from these appropriations of budget authority.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Debt forgiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in calendar year 1990 or 1991, an appropriation is enacted that forgives the Arab Republic of Egypt's foreign military sales indebtedness to the United States and any part of the Government of Poland's indebtedness to the United States, the adjustment shall be the estimated costs (in new budget authority and outlays, in all years) of that forgiveness.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) IMF funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in fiscal year 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, or 1995 an appropriation is enacted to provide to the International Monetary Fund the dollar equivalent, in terms of Special Drawing Rights, of the increase in the United States quota as part of the International Monetary Fund Ninth General Review of Quotas, the adjustment shall be the amount provided by that appropriation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(D) Emergency appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If, for any fiscal year, appropriations for discretionary accounts are enacted that the President designates as emergency requirements and that the Congress so designates in statute, the adjustment shall be the total of such appropriations in discretionary accounts designated as emergency requirements and the outlays flowing in all years from such appropriations. This subparagraph shall not apply to appropriations to cover agricultural crop disaster assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The costs for operation Desert Shield are to be treated as emergency funding requirements not subject to the defense spending limits. Funding for Desert Shield will be provided through the normal legislative process. Desert Shield costs should be accommodated through Allied burden-sharing, subsequent appropriation Acts, and if the President so chooses, through offsets within other defense accounts. Emergency Desert Shield costs mean those incremental costs associated with the increase in operations in the Middle East and do not include costs that would be experienced by the Department of Defense as part of its normal operations absent Operation Desert Shield.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(E) Special allowance for discretionary new budget authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) For each of fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the adjustment for the domestic category in each year shall be an amount equal to 0.1 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary spending limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively), together with outlays associated therewith (calculated at the composite outlay rate for the domestic category);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for each of fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the adjustment for the international category in each year shall be an amount equal to 0.079 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary spending limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively), together with outlays associated therewith (calculated at the composite outlay rate for the international category);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) if, for fiscal years 1992 and 1993, the amount of new budget authority provided in appropriation Acts exceeds the discretionary spending limit on new budget authority for any category due to technical estimates made by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the adjustment is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed an amount (for 1992 and 1993 together) equal to 0.042 percent of the sum of the adjusted discretionary limits on new budget authority for all categories for fiscal years 1991, 1992, and 1993 (cumulatively); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) if, for fiscal years 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, and 1998, the amount of new budget authority provided in appropriation Acts exceeds the discretionary spending limit on new budget authority due to technical estimates made by the director&nbsp;<sup><a href="#901_1_target" name="901_1">1</a></sup> of the Office of Management and Budget, the adjustment is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed an amount (for any one fiscal year) equal to 0.1 percent of the adjusted descretionary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#901_2_target" name="901_2">2</a></sup> spending limit on new budget authority for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(F) Special outlay allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If in any fiscal year outlays for a category exceed the discretionary spending limit for that category but new budget authority does not exceed its limit for that category (after application of the first step of a sequestration described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, if necessary), the adjustment in outlays is the amount of the excess, but not to exceed $2,500,000,000 in the defense category, $1,500,000,000 in the international category, or $2,500,000,000 in the domestic category (as applicable) in fiscal year 1991, 1992, or 1993, and not to exceed $6,500,000,000 in fiscal year 1994 or 1995 less any of the outlay adjustments made under subparagraph (E) for a category for a fiscal year, and not to exceed 0.5 percent of the adjusted descretionary&nbsp;<sup><a href="#901_2_target" name="901_2">2</a></sup> spending limit on outlays for the fiscal year in fiscal year 1996, 1997, or 1998.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Look-back</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, after June 30, an appropriation for the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a budgetary excess in the Violent Crime Reduction Trust Fund as described in subsection (b) of this section for that year (after taking into account any sequestration of amounts under this section), the level set forth in subsection (b) of this section for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of that excess.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Fiscal years 1992&ndash;1998 enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to assure that any legislation (enacted after November 5, 1990) affecting direct spending or receipts that increases the deficit in any fiscal year covered by this Act will trigger an offsetting sequestration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sequestration; look-back</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 of this title and section 903 of this title, there shall be a sequestration to offset the amount of any net deficit increase in that fiscal year and the prior fiscal year caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any prior sequestration as provided by paragraph (2)). OMB shall calculate the amount of deficit increase, if any, in those fiscal years by adding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) all applicable estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under subsection (d) of this section applicable to those fiscal years, other than any amounts included in such estimates resulting from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on November 5, 1990, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) emergency provisions as designated under subsection (e) of this section; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to those fiscal years resulting from the prior year's sequestration under this section or section 903 of this title, if any (except for any amounts sequestered as a result of a net deficit increase in the fiscal year immediately preceding the prior fiscal year), as published in OMB's end-of-session sequestration report for that prior year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eliminating a deficit increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount required to be sequestered in a fiscal year under subsection (b) of this section shall be obtained from non-exempt direct spending accounts from actions taken in the following order:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(A) First</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All reductions in automatic spending increases specified in section 906(a) of this title shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(B) Second</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, the maximum reductions permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed student loans) and 906(c) of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(C) Third</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) If additional reductions in direct spending accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt direct spending account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in direct spending required by paragraph (1); except that the medicare programs specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 4 percent and the uniform percentage applicable to all other direct spending programs under this paragraph shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in direct spending.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For purposes of determining reductions under clause (i), outlay reductions (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) OMB estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after Congress completes action on any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990, after consultation with the Committees on the Budget of the House of Representatives and the Senate, CBO shall provide OMB with an estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation. Within 5 calendar days after the enactment of any direct spending or receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990, OMB shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives and to the Senate containing such CBO estimate of that legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of change in outlays or receipts, as the case may be, in each fiscal year through fiscal year 1998 resulting from that legislation, and an explanation of any difference between the two estimates. Those OMB estimates shall be made using current economic and technical assumptions. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping guidelines determined after consultation among the House and Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and OMB.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:354 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Emergency legislation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, for any fiscal year from 1991 through 1998, a provision of direct spending or receipts legislation is enacted that the President designates as an emergency requirement and that the Congress so designates in statute, the amounts of new budget authority, outlays, and receipts in all fiscal years through 1995&nbsp;<sup><a href="#902_1_target" name="902_1">1</a></sup> resulting from that provision shall be designated as an emergency requirement in the reports required under subsection (d) of this section.

<p class="statutory-body">Within 15 calendar days after Congress adjourns to end a session (other than of the One Hundred First Congress) and on the same day as a sequestration (if any) under section 901 of this title and section 902 of this title, but after any sequestration required by section 901 of this title (enforcing discretionary spending limits) or section 902 of this title (enforcing pay-as-you-go), there shall be a sequestration to eliminate the excess deficit (if any remains) if it exceeds the margin.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Excess deficit; margin</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The excess deficit is, if greater than zero, the estimated deficit for the budget year, minus&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the maximum deficit amount for that year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amounts for that year designated as emergency direct spending or receipts legislation under section 902(e) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for any fiscal year in which there is not a full adjustment for technical and economic reestimates, the deposit insurance reestimate for that year, if any, calculated under subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The &ldquo;margin&rdquo; for fiscal year 1992 or 1993 is zero and for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is $15,000,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Dividing sequestration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To eliminate the excess deficit in a budget year, half of the required outlay reductions shall be obtained from non-exempt defense accounts (accounts designated as function 050 in the President's fiscal year 1991 budget submission) and half from non-exempt, non-defense accounts (all other non-exempt accounts).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Defense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each non-exempt defense account shall be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the level of sequestrable budgetary re<!-- PDFPage:355 -->sources in that account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to carry out subsection (c) of this section, except that, if any military personnel are exempt, adjustments shall be made under the procedure set forth in section 901(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Non-defense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Actions to reduce non-defense accounts shall be taken in the following order:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) First</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">All reductions in automatic spending increases under section 906(a) of this title shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Second</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are required to be made, the maximum reduction permissible under sections 906(b) of this title (guaranteed student loans) and 906(c) of this title (foster care and adoption assistance) shall be made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Third</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If additional reductions in non-defense accounts are required to be made, each remaining non-exempt, non-defense account shall be reduced by the uniform percentage necessary to make the reductions in non-defense outlays required by subsection (c) of this section, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the medicare program specified in section 906(d) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent in total including any reduction of less than 2 percent made under section 902 of this title or, if it has been reduced by 2 percent or more under section 902 of this title, it may not be further reduced under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the health programs set forth in section 906(e) of this title shall not be reduced by more than 2 percent in total (including any reduction made under section 901 of this title),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and the uniform percent applicable to all other programs under this subsection shall be increased (if necessary) to a level sufficient to achieve the required reduction in non-defense outlays.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of determining reductions under subparagraph (A), outlay reduction (as a result of sequestration of Commodity Credit Corporation commodity price support contracts in the fiscal year of a sequestration) that would occur in the following fiscal year shall be credited as outlay reductions in the fiscal year of the sequestration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Baseline assumptions; part-year appropriations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Budget assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsections (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section, accounts shall be assumed to be at the level in the baseline minus any reductions required to be made under sections 901 and 902 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Part-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the date specified in subsection (a) of this section, there is in effect an Act making or continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any non-exempt budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for that account under subsection (d) or (e) of this section, as applicable, shall be subtracted from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by law in that account under that or a subsequent part-year appropriation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) when a full-year appropriation for that account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided by the full-year appropriation; except that the amount to be sequestered from that account shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the savings achieved by that appropriation when the enacted amount is less than the baseline for that account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Adjustments to maximum deficit amounts</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1992, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1992, 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions. When the President submits the budget for fiscal year 1993, the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1993, 1994, and 1995 shall be further adjusted to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions and any changes in concepts or definitions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) When submitting the budget for fiscal year 1994, the President may choose to adjust the maximum deficit amounts for fiscal years 1994 and 1995 to reflect up-to-date reestimates of economic and technical assumptions. If the President chooses to adjust the maximum deficit amount when submitting the fiscal year 1994 budget, the President may choose to invoke the same adjustment procedure when submitting the budget for fiscal year 1995. In each case, the President must choose between making no adjustment or the full adjustment described in paragraph (2). If the President chooses to make that full adjustment, then those procedures for adjusting discretionary spending limits described in sections 901(b)(1)(C) and 901(b)(2)(E) of this title, otherwise applicable through fiscal year 1993 or 1994 (as the case may be), shall be deemed to apply for fiscal year 1994 (and 1995 if applicable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) When the budget for fiscal year 1994 or 1995 is submitted and the sequestration reports for those years under section 904 of this title are made (as applicable), if the President does not choose to make the adjustments set forth in subparagraph (B), the maximum deficit amount for that fiscal year shall be adjusted by the amount of the adjustment to discretionary spending limits first applicable for that year (if any) under section 901(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) For each fiscal year the adjustments required to be made with the submission of the President's budget for that year shall also be made when OMB submits the sequestration update report and the final sequestration report for that year, but OMB shall continue to use the economic and technical <!-- PDFPage:356 -->assumptions in the President's budget for that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each adjustment shall be made by increasing or decreasing the maximum deficit amounts set forth in section 665 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculations of adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The required increase or decrease shall be calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The baseline deficit or surplus shall be calculated using up-to-date economic and technical assumptions, using up-to-date concepts and definitions, and, in lieu of the baseline levels of discretionary appropriations, using the discretionary spending limits set forth in section 665 of this title as adjusted under section 901 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The net deficit increase or decrease caused by all direct spending and receipts legislation enacted after November 5, 1990 (after adjusting for any sequestration of direct spending accounts) shall be calculated for each fiscal year by adding&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the estimates of direct spending and receipts legislation transmitted under section 902(d) of this title applicable to each such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the estimated amount of savings in direct spending programs applicable to each such fiscal year resulting from the prior year's sequestration under this section or section 902 of this title of direct spending, if any, as contained in OMB's final sequestration report for that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The amount calculated under subparagraph (B) shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The maximum deficit amount set forth in section 665 of this title shall be subtracted from the amount calculated under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The amount calculated under subparagraph (D) shall be the amount of the adjustment required by paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Treatment of deposit insurance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Initial estimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The initial estimates of the net costs of federal deposit insurance for fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995 (assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of the submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993) shall be set forth in that budget.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reestimates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For fiscal year 1994 and fiscal year 1995, the amount of the reestimate of deposit insurance costs shall be calculated by subtracting the amount set forth under paragraph (1) for that year from the current estimate of deposit insurance costs (but assuming full funding of, and continuation of, the deposit insurance guarantee commitment in effect on the date of submission of the budget for fiscal year 1993).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reallotment of amounts remaining unallotted after application of general rule  </h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any amount made available after sequestration for direct spending pursuant to section 403(<em>l</em>) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 603(<em>l</em>)] for the fiscal year to which the sequestration applies that remains unallotted as a result of subparagraph (A) of <!-- PDFPage:369 -->this paragraph shall be allotted among the States in proportion to the absolute difference between the amount allotted, respectively, to each State as a result of such subparagraph and the amount that would have been allotted to such State pursuant to section 403(k) of such Act had the sequestration not been in effect, except that a State may not be allotted an amount under this subparagraph that results in a total allotment to the State under this paragraph of more than the amount that would have been allotted to such State pursuant to such section 403(k) had the sequestration not been in effect.  </p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Effects of sequestration  </h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The effects of sequestration shall be as follows:  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Budgetary resources sequestered from any account other than a trust or special fund account shall be permanently cancelled.  </p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Administrative regulations or similar actions implementing a sequestration shall be made within 120 days of the sequestration order. To the extent that formula allocations differ at different levels of budgetary resources within an account, program, project, or activity, the sequestration shall be interpreted as producing a lower total appropriation, with the remaining amount of the appropriation being obligated in a manner consistent with program allocation formulas in substantive law.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Except as otherwise provided, obligations in sequestered accounts shall be reduced only in the fiscal year in which a sequester occurs.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) If an automatic spending increase is sequestered, the increase (in the applicable index) that was disregarded as a result of that sequestration shall not be taken into account in any subsequent fiscal year.  </p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Except as otherwise provided, sequestration in trust and special fund accounts for which obligations are indefinite shall be taken in a manner to ensure that obligations in the fiscal year of a sequestration are reduced, from the level that would actually have occurred, by the applicable sequestration percentage.  </p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;907. The baseline</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any budget year, the baseline refers to a projection of current-year levels of new budget authority, outlays, revenues, and the surplus or deficit into the budget year and the outyears based on laws enacted through the applicable date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Direct spending and receipts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Laws providing or creating direct spending and receipts are assumed to operate in the manner specified in those laws for each such year and funding for entitlement authority is assumed to be adequate to make all payments required by those laws.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) No program with estimated current-year outlays greater than $50 million shall be assumed to expire in the budget year or outyears.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:371 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The increase for veterans&rsquo; compensation for a fiscal year is assumed to be the same as that required by law for veterans&rsquo; pensions unless otherwise provided by law enacted in that session.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Excise taxes dedicated to a trust fund, if expiring, are assumed to be extended at current rates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Hospital Insurance Trust Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the receipts and disbursements of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund shall be included in all calculations required by this Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Discretionary appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the budget year and each outyear, the baseline shall be calculated using the following assumptions regarding all amounts other than those covered by subsection (b) of this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Inflation of current-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level provided for the budget year in full-year appropriation Acts. If for any account a full-year appropriation has not yet been enacted, budgetary resources other than unobligated balances shall be at the level available in the current year, adjusted sequentially and cumulatively for expiring housing contracts as specified in paragraph (2), for social insurance administrative expenses as specified in paragraph (3), to offset pay absorption and for pay annualization as specified in paragraph (4), for inflation as specified in paragraph (5), and to account for changes required by law in the level of agency payments for personnel benefits other than pay.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expiring housing contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">New budget authority to renew expiring multiyear subsidized housing contracts shall be adjusted to reflect the difference in the number of such contracts that are scheduled to expire in that fiscal year and the number expiring in the current year, with the per-contract renewal cost equal to the average current-year cost of renewal contracts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Social insurance administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Budgetary resources for the administrative expenses of the following trust funds shall be adjusted by the percentage change in the beneficiary population from the current year to that fiscal year: the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund, the Unemployment Trust Fund, and the railroad retirement account.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Pay annualization; offset to pay absorption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Current-year new budget authority for Federal employees shall be adjusted to reflect the full 12-month costs (without absorption) of any pay adjustment that occurred in that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Inflators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust budgetary resources relating to personnel shall be the percent by which the average of the Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment Cost Index (wages and salaries, private industry workers) for that fiscal year differs from such index for the current year. The inflator used in paragraph (1) to adjust all other budgetary resources shall be the percent by which the average of the estimated gross national product fixed-weight price index for that fiscal year differs from the average of such estimated index for the current year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Current-year appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, for any account, a continuing appropriation is in effect for less than the entire current year, then the current-year amount shall be assumed to equal the amount that would be available if that continuing appropriation covered the entire fiscal year. If law permits the transfer of budget authority among budget accounts in the current year, the current-year level for an account shall reflect transfers accomplished by the submission of, or assumed for the current year in, the President's original budget for the budget year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Up-to-date concepts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In deriving the baseline for any budget year or outyear, current-year amounts shall be calculated using the concepts and definitions that are required for that budget year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Sale of assets or prepayment of loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The sale of an asset or prepayment of a loan shall not alter the deficit or produce any net deficit reduction in the budget baseline, except that the budget baseline estimate shall include asset sales mandated by law before September 18, 1987, and routine, ongoing asset sales and loan prepayments at levels consistent with agency operations in fiscal year 1986;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#907_1_target" name="907_1">1</a></sup></p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Introduction of joint resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time after the Director of OMB issues a final sequestration report under section 904 of this title for a fiscal year, but before the close of the twentieth calendar day of the session of Congress beginning after the date of issuance of such report, the majority leader of either House of Congress may introduce a joint resolution which contains provisions directing the President to modify the most recent order issued under section 904 of this title or provide an alternative to reduce the deficit for such fiscal year. After the introduction of the first such joint resolution in either House of Congress in any calendar year, then no other joint resolution introduced in such House in such calendar year shall be subject to the procedures set forth in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures for consideration of joint resolutions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Referral to committee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A joint resolution introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) of this section shall not be referred to a committee of the Senate and shall be placed on the calendar pending disposition of such joint resolution in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration in Senate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On or after the third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after a joint resolution is introduced under subsection (a) of this section, notwithstanding any rule or precedent of the Senate, including Rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution. The motion is not in order after the eighth calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after a joint resolution (to which the motion applies) is introduced. The joint resolution is privileged in the Senate. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the Senate shall immediately proceed to consideration of the joint resolution without intervening motion, order, or other business, and the joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate until disposed of.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Debate in Senate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the Senate, debate on a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section, amendments thereto, and all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between the majority leader and the minority leader (or their designees).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the joint resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order, and a motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) No amendment that is not germane to the provisions of the joint resolution or to the order issued under section 904 of this title shall be in order in the Senate. In the Senate, an amendment, any amendment to an amendment, or any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for not to exceed 30 minutes to be equally divided between, and controlled by, the mover and the majority leader (or their designees), except that in the event that the majority leader favors the amendment, motion, or appeal, the minority leader (or the minority leader's designee) shall control the time in opposition to the amendment, motion, or appeal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) In the Senate, an amendment that is otherwise in order shall be in order notwithstanding the fact that it amends the joint resolution in more than one place or amends language previously amended. It shall not be in order in the Senate to vote on the question of agreeing to such a joint resolution or any amendment thereto unless the figures then contained in such joint resolution or amendment are mathematically consistent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Vote on final passage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section, a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate, and the disposition of any pending amendments under paragraph (3), the vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Appeals from the decisions of the Chair shall be decided without debate.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Resolution from other House</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, before the passage by the Senate of a joint resolution of the Senate introduced under subsection (a) of this section, the Senate receives from the House of Representatives a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section, then the following procedures shall apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The joint resolution of the House of Representatives shall not be referred to a committee and shall be placed on the calendar.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:375 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) With respect to a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section in the Senate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the procedure in the Senate shall be the same as if no joint resolution had been received from the House; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) the vote on final passage shall be on the joint resolution of the House if it is identical to the joint resolution then pending for passage in the Senate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) if the joint resolution from the House is not identical to the joint resolution then pending for passage in the Senate and the Senate then passes the Senate joint resolution, the Senate shall be considered to have passed the House joint resolution as amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Upon disposition of the joint resolution received from the House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the resolution originated in the Senate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Senate action on House resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Senate receives from the House of Representatives a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section after the Senate has disposed of a Senate originated resolution which is identical to the House passed joint resolution, the action of the Senate with regard to the disposition of the Senate originated joint resolution shall be deemed to be the action of the Senate with regard to the House originated joint resolution. If it is not identical to the House passed joint resolution, then the Senate shall be considered to have passed the joint resolution of the House as amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.</p>

To the extent such additional reductions are made and result in additional outlay reductions, the President may provide for lesser reductions in new budget authority and unobligated balances for other programs, projects, or activities within major functional category 050 for such fiscal year, but only to the extent that the resulting outlay increases do not exceed the additional outlay reductions, and no such program, project, or activity may be increased above the level actually made available by law in appropriation Acts (before taking sequestration into account). In making calculations under this subsection, the President shall use account outlay rates that are identical to those used in the report by the Director of OMB under section 904 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Base closures prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No actions taken by the President under subsection (a) of this section for a fiscal year may result in a domestic base closure or realignment that would otherwise be subject to section 2687 of title 10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the Senate, an amendment which adds to a resolution reported under paragraph (2) an instruction of the type referred to in such paragraph shall be in order during the consideration of such resolution if such amendment would be in order but for the fact that it would be held to be non-germane on the basis that the instruction constitutes new matter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Introduction of joint resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time after the Director of OMB issues a report under section 901(c)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#908_1_target" name="908_1">1</a></sup> of this title for a fiscal year, but before the close of the tenth calendar day of session in that session of Congress beginning after the date of issuance of such report, the majority leader of either House of Congress may introduce a joint resolution which contains provisions directing the President to modify the most recent order issued under section 902&nbsp;<sup><a href="#908_1_target" name="908_1">1</a></sup> of this title for such fiscal year. After the introduction of the first such joint resolution in either House of Congress in any calendar year, then no other joint resolution introduced in such House in such calendar year shall be subject to the procedures set forth in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures for consideration of joint resolutions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No referral to committee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A joint resolution introduced in the Senate or the House of Representatives under subsection (a) of this section shall not be referred to a committee of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, and shall be placed on the appropriate calendar pending disposition of such joint resolution in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Immediate consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On or after the third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after a joint resolution is introduced under subsection (a) of this section, notwithstanding any rule or precedent of the Senate, including Rule 22 of the Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order (even though a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to) for any Member of the respective House to move to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution, and all points of order against the joint resolution (and against consideration of the joint resolution) are waived, except for points of order under titles III or IV of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 [2 U.S.C. 631 et seq., 651 et seq.]. The motion is not in order after the eighth calendar day (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) beginning after a joint resolution (to which the motion applies) is introduced. The motion is highly privileged in the House of Representatives and is privileged in the Senate and is not debatable. The motion is not subject to amendment, or to a motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the respective House shall immediately proceed to consideration of the joint resolution without intervening motion, order, or other business, and the joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business of the respective House until disposed of.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:379 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Debate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the Senate, debate on a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section, amendments thereto, and all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 hours, which shall be divided equally between the majority leader and the minority leader (or their designees). In the House, general debate on a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section shall be limited to not more than 4 hours which shall be equally divided between the majority and minority leaders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other business is not in order. A motion to reconsider the vote by which the joint resolution is agreed to or disagreed to is not in order. In the Senate, a motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in order. In the House, a motion further to limit debate is in order and not debatable. In the House, a motion to recommit is in order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) In the House of Representatives, an amendment and any amendment thereto is debatable for not to exceed 30 minutes to be equally divided between the proponent of the amendment and a Member opposed thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) No amendment that is not germane or relevant to the provisions of the joint resolution or to the order issued under section 902(b)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#908_1_target" name="908_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall be in order in the Senate. In the Senate, an amendment, any amendment to an amendment, or any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for not to exceed 30 minutes to be equally divided between the majority leader and the minority leader (or their designees).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) In the Senate, an amendment that is otherwise in order shall be in order notwithstanding the fact that it amends the joint resolution in more than one place or amends language previously amended. It shall not be in order in the Senate to vote on the question of agreeing to such a joint resolution or any amendment thereto unless the figures then contained in such joint resolution or amendment are mathematically consistent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Vote on final passage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Immediately following the conclusion of the debate on a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section, a single quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of the appropriate House, and the disposition of any amendments under paragraph (3) (except for the motion to recommit in the House of Representatives), the vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall occur.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Appeals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Appeals from the decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules of the Senate or the House of Representatives, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to a joint resolution described in subsection (a) of this section shall be decided without debate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Conference reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the Senate, points of order under titles III and IV of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 [2 U.S.C. 631 et seq., 651 et seq.] (including points of order under sections 302(c), 303(a), 306, and 401(b)(1) [2 U.S.C. 633(c), 634(a), 637, 651(b)(1)]) are applicable to a conference report on the joint resolution or any amendments in disagreement thereto.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Resolution from other House</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, before the passage by the Senate of a joint resolution of the Senate introduced under subsection (a) of this section, the Senate receives from the House of Representatives a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section, then the following procedures shall apply:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The joint resolution of the House of Representatives shall not be referred to a committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) With respect to a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section in the Senate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the procedure in the Senate shall be the same as if no joint resolution had been received from the House; but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) the vote on final passage shall be on the joint resolution of the House if it is identical to the joint resolution then pending for passage in the Senate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) if the joint resolution from the House is not identical to the joint resolution then pending for passage in the Senate and the Senate then passes it, the Senate shall be considered to have passed the joint resolution as amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Upon disposition of the joint resolution received from the House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the resolution originated in the Senate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Senate action on House resolution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Senate receives from the House of Representatives a joint resolution introduced under subsection (a) of this section after the Senate has disposed of a Senate originated resolution which is identical to the House passed joint resolution, the action of the Senate with regard to the disposition of the Senate originated joint resolution shall be deemed to be the action of the Senate with regard to the House originated joint resolution. If it is not identical to the House passed joint resolution, then the Senate shall be considered to have passed the joint resolution of the House as amended by the text of the Senate joint resolution.</p>
