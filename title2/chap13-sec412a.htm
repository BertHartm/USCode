<p class="statutory-body">The House members of the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations shall undertake and conduct a continuing study of the jurisdiction of the various standing committees of the House under Rule X of the Rules of the House and the relative workloads sustained by such committees as a result thereof, and periodically shall prepare for submission to and consideration by the Committee on Rules (and for possible submission by that committee to the full House) a report including any recommended changes in the Rules of the House which may be necessary or appropriate to effect a more equitable distribution of workload or a more rational combination of jurisdictional responsibilities. It is the sense of the House of Representatives that the House members of the Joint Committee on Congressional Operations should work with the Senate members of such joint committee in an effort to rationalize the committee jurisdiction between the Houses.  </p>
