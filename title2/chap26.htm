<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) responsible representative Government requires public awareness of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence the public decisionmaking process in both the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the effective public disclosure of the identity and extent of the efforts of paid lobbyists to influence Federal officials in the conduct of Government actions will increase public confidence in the integrity of Government.</p>
