<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Each officer or member of the Capitol Police force whose compensation is disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate, who performs duty in addition to the number of hours of his regularly scheduled tour of duty for any day on or after July 1, 1974, is entitled to be paid compensation (when ordered to perform such duty by proper authority) or receive compensatory time off for each such additional hour of duty, except that an officer shall be entitled to such compensation only upon a determination made by the Capitol Police Board with respect to any additional hours. Compensation of an officer or member for each additional hour of duty shall be paid at a rate equal to his hourly rate of compensation in the case of an officer, and at a rate equal to one and one-half times his hourly rate of compensation for a member of such force. The hourly rate of compensation of such officer or member shall be determined by dividing his annual rate of compensation by 2,080. Any officer or member entitled to be paid compensation for such additional hours shall make a written election, <!-- PDFPage:518 -->which is irrevocable, whether he desires to be paid that compensation or to receive compensatory time off instead for each such hour. Compensation due officers and members under this paragraph shall be paid by the Secretary, upon certification by the Chief of the Capitol Police at the end of each calendar quarter and approval of the Capitol Police Board, from funds available in the Senate appropriation, &ldquo;Salaries, Officers and Employees&rdquo; for the fiscal year in which the additional hours of duty are performed without regard to the limitations specified therein. Any compensatory time off accrued and not used by an officer or member at the time he is separated from service on the Capitol Police force may not be transferred to any other department, agency, or establishment of the United States Government or the government of the District of Columbia, and no lump-sum amount shall be paid for such accrued time. The Capitol Police Board is authorized to prescribe regulations to carry out this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorization of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Capitol Police Board (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) may authorize the Chief of the United States Capitol Police (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Chief&rdquo;) to pay a bonus to an individual who is newly appointed to a position as an officer or employee of the Capitol Police, and to pay an additional bonus to an individual who must relocate to accept a position as an officer or employee of the Capitol Police, if the Board determines that the Capitol Police would be likely, in the absence of such a bonus, to encounter difficulty in filling the position.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of a bonus under this subsection shall be determined by regulations of the Board, but the amount of any bonus paid to an individual under this subsection may not exceed 25 percent of the annual rate of basic pay of the position to which the individual is being appointed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Minimum period of service required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payment of a bonus under this subsection shall be contingent upon the individual entering into an agreement with the Capitol Police to complete a period of employment with the Capitol Police, with the required period determined pursuant to regulations of the Board. If the individual voluntarily fails to complete such period of service or is separated from the service before completion of such period of service for cause on charges of misconduct or delinquency, the individual shall repay the bonus on a pro rata basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Bonus not considered part of basic pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A bonus under this subsection shall be paid as a lump sum, and may not be considered to <!-- PDFPage:519 -->be part of the basic pay of the officer or employee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Payment permitted prior to commencement of duty</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorization of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Board may authorize the Chief to pay an allowance to an officer or employee of the United States Capitol Police if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the unusually high or unique qualifications of the officer or employee or a special need of the Capitol Police for the officer's or employee's services makes it essential to retain the officer or employee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Chief determines that the officer or employee would be likely to leave in the absence of a retention allowance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A retention allowance, which shall be stated as a percentage of the rate of basic pay of the officer or employee, may not exceed 25 percent of such rate of basic pay.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment not considered part of basic pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A retention allowance may not be considered to be part of the basic pay of an officer or employee, and the reduction or elimination of a retention allowance may not be appealed.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Time and manner of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A retention allowance under this subsection shall be paid at the same time and in the same manner as the officer's or employee's basic pay is paid.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an officer of the United States Capitol Police in a service step who has demonstrated meritorious service (in accordance with criteria established by the Chief or the Chief's designee) may be advanced in compensation to the next higher service step, effective with the first pay period which begins after the date of the Chief's approval; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an officer of the United States Capitol Police in a service step who has demonstrated extraordinary performance (in accordance with criteria established by the Chief or the Chief's designee) may be advanced in compensation to the second next higher service step, effective with the first pay period which begins after the date of the Chief's approval.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Additional compensation for field training officers</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Manner of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The additional compensation authorized by this subsection shall be paid to the officer in the same manner as the officer is paid basic compensation, except that when the officer ceases to be assigned to duty as a field training officer, the loss of such additional compensation shall not constitute an adverse action for any purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The payment of bonuses, allowances, step increases, compensation, and other payments pursuant to this section shall be carried out in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Board.</p>
