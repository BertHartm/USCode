<h4 class="note-head">Committee Order No. 31</h4>
<p class="note-body">Resolved, that effective April 1, 1977, until otherwise provided by order of the Committee on House Administration, each Member, Delegate or Resident Commissioner of the House of Representatives may compensate employees from the clerk-hire allowance at a per annum rate equivalent to, and not to exceed, the highest per annum rate of basic pay, as in effect from time to time, authorized for Level V of the Executive Schedule (5 U.S.C. 5316).</p>
<h4 class="note-head">To Accompany Committee Order No. 31</h4>
<p class="note-body">This order will tie the maximum annual rate of compensation which may be paid from the clerk-hire allowance to the Executive Schedule, and will reestablish the previously existing parity between the maximum which may be paid a committee employee, and the maximum which may be paid a clerk-hire employee.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:39 --><p class="note-body">The Order raises the ceiling from its present level of $39,600 to $47,500, which corresponds to a Level V position, but provides no additional funds to the clerk-hire allowance. If a Member desires to raise an employee's salary, it must be done from the existing allowance.</p>
<p class="note-body">This action is clearly within the Committee's authority under 2 U.S.C. 57 as modified by H.Res. 1372 (P.L. 94&ndash;440) [2 U.S.C. 57a], because it sets a &ldquo;term or condition&rdquo; of an allowance, and does not fix or adjust the amount of an allowance, which action would require a vote on the House floor.</p>
