<!-- field-end:effectivedate-note -->
<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I herewith transmit my plan for the Reorganization of the Executive Office of the President (EOP), Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1977. This plan is the first of a series I intend to submit under the reorganization authority vested in me by the Reorganization Act of 1977 (Public Law 95&ndash;17) [5 U.S.C. 901&ndash;912]. It adheres to the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of the Act [5 U.S.C. 901(a)].</p>
<p class="note-body">This plan in conjunction with the other steps I am taking will:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Eliminate seven of the seventeen units now within the EOP and modify the rest. There were 19 units when I took office; the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board and the Economic Policy Board have already been abolished. Thus with this plan I will have eliminated nine of 19 EOP units.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Reduce EOP staffing by about 250 which includes the White House staff reduction of 134 or 28 percent which I have already ordered.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Improve efficiency by centralizing administrative functions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Improve the process by which information is provided for Presidential decisionmaking.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:9 --><p class="note-body">These recommendations arise from a careful, systematic study of the EOP. They are based on the premise that the EOP exists to serve the President and should be structured to meet his needs. They will reduce waste and cost while improving the service the President, and the nation, receive from the EOP.</p>
<p class="note-body">The EOP now consists of the immediate White House Office, the Vice President's Office, the Office of Management and Budget, and fourteen other agencies. The EOP has a budget authority of about $80,000,000 and 1,712 full time employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The White House Office concentrates on close personal support including policy and political advice and administrative and operational services. The Office of the Vice President provides similar support to him. OMB's primary mission is to develop and implement the budget; it also carries out a number of management and reorganization activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Three EOP units have responsibility for policy development:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">National Security Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Domestic Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Council on International Economic Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">The other 11 are more specialized offices that offer analysis and advice, help develop policy in certain areas, or carry out special projects. These are:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Council on Wage and Price Stability.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Office of Drug Abuse Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Office of Telecommunications Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Intelligence Oversight Board.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Federal Property Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Energy Resources Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Economic Opportunity Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">To make the EOP more effective, four steps are necessary:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">I. Strengthen management of policy issues.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">II. Limit the EOP, wherever possible, to functions directly related to the President's work.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">III. Centralize administrative services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">IV. Reduce size of White House and EOP staffs.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">i. strengthen process management of policy issues</h4>
<p class="note-body">Perhaps the most important function of the President's staff is to make sure he has the wide variety of views and facts he needs to make decisions. By building a more orderly system for collecting information and advice, the President can make sure that he will hear all the views he should&mdash;and hear them in time. To better insure that this happens, I am taking the following actions to:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Institute for domestic and economic issues, a system similar to the Presidential Review Memorandum process currently used for National Security issues.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Create a committee of Presidential advisers, chaired by the Vice President, to set priorities among issues and oversee their staffing.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Assure that Presidential decision memoranda on policy issues are coordinated with Cabinet and EOP advisers most involved with the issue.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Consolidate under the Staff Secretary the two current White House paper circulation systems.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Appoint a group of advisers to review the decisionmaking process periodically.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Give the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy clear responsibility for managing the way in which domestic and most economic policy issues are prepared for Presidential decision.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Assign follow-up responsibility for Presidential decisions as follows: immediate follow-up will be handled by the NSC or Domestic Policy Staff most directly involved in the issue; long term follow-up on selected issues will be handled by the Assistant to the President for Intergovernmental Relations.</p>
<p class="note-body">These actions recognize that the White House and Executive Office staff must use their proximity to the President to insure that the full resources of the government and the public are brought to bear on Presidential decisions in a timely fashion. It is my purpose in instituting these changes to strengthen Cabinet participation in Presidential decisions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">ii. rationalize eop structure by limiting eop, wherever possible, to functions which bear a close relationship to the work of the president</h4>
<p class="note-body">As the President's principal staff institution, there are several major things the EOP must do:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Provide day-to-day operational support (e.g., scheduling, appointments) and help the President communicate with the public, the Congress, and the press.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Manage the budget and coordinate Administration positions on matters before the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Manage the Presidential decisionmaking processes efficiently and fairly, and bring the President the widest possible range of opinions.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Help the President: plan and set priorities; monitor and evaluate progress toward achieving the President's objectives; understand and resolve major conflicts among line subordinates; manage crises, especially in national security matters.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to restructure the EOP around these basic functions, the functions of seven units should be discontinued or transferred, and ten units, including the White House Office, should be retained but modified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Seven units should be discontinued or their functions transferred. These are:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">1. Office of Drug Abuse Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">2. Office of Telecommunications Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">3. Council on International Economic Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">4. Federal Property Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">5. Energy Resources Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">6. Economic Opportunity Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">7. Domestic Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">The functions of the Office of Drug Abuse Policy (ODAP) can be performed by a smaller staff reporting to a Presidential adviser in the EOP. The Office itself will be discontinued.</p>
<p class="note-body">Much of the work done by the Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) can be more effectively performed outside the EOP. It is important that the EOP have the capacity to resolve differences and that the President have immediate advice on telecommunications and information policy, especially on national security, emergency preparedness and privacy issues. This only requires a small staff within EOP. The Office of Management and Budget would take responsibility for Federal telecommunications procurement and management policy and arbitration of interagency disputes about frequency allocation. All other functions except developing Presidential policy options would be transferred to a new office within the Department of Commerce, headed by a new Assistant Secretary for Communications and Information, who will perform many of the functions previously performed by the head of the OTP.</p>
<p class="note-body">I propose that the Economic Opportunity Council be discontinued; it is dormant and its only active function (preparation of the Catalogue of Federal Domestic Assistance) is being performed by OMB. Three other units are also inactive and should be discontinued: Council on International Economic Policy, the Federal Property Council, and the Energy Resources Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Domestic Council should be abolished. It has rarely functioned as a Council, because it is too large and its membership too diverse to make decisions efficiently. Its functions have been performed entirely by its staff. This Domestic Policy Staff should report to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Affairs and Policy. Under the policy process system described earlier, they should manage the process which coordinates the making of domestic and most economic policy. They should work closely with the Cabinet departments and agencies to insure that the views of the Cabinet and agency heads are brought to the President before decisions are made.</p>
<p class="note-body">The ten EOP units which will continue with some modification are:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:10 --><p class="note-body-1em">1. White House Office.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">2. Office of the Vice President.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">3. Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">4. Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">5. Council of Economic Advisers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">6. Office of Science and Technology Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">7. Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">8. National Security Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">9. Intelligence Oversight Board.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">10. Council on Wage and Price Stability.</p>
<p class="note-body">The operations of the Office of the Vice President reflect the combination of constitutional, statutory, and Presidentially assigned duties that make it unique among EOP units. Because his interests and assignments cover the same range as the President's, the Vice President requires a staff with expertise in diverse areas. Its basic functions should not be changed. However, I propose that certain support functions&mdash;involving accounting, personnel services, and supply&mdash;be transferred to a centralized EOP Administrative Unit.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Office of Management and Budget would remain as a separate entity in the EOP, but some functional changes should be made. Four functions should be transferred from OMB to other parts of the government:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Administration to the new EOP Central Administrative Unit;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Executive Department/Labor Relations (except for Pay Agent, Executive Level Pools, and Legislative Analysis) to the Civil Service Commission;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Advisory Committee Management Secretariat to the General Services Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Statistical Policy (except Forms Clearance) to the Department of Commerce.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have asked the OMB to reorganize its management arm to emphasize major Presidential initiatives, such as reorganization, program evaluation, paperwork reduction, and regulatory reform.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) should remain in the EOP as an environmental adviser to the President. The CEQ's major purpose is to provide an independent assessment of our policies for improving the environment. Toward this end, it will analyze long term trends and conditions in the environment. It will advise OMB on the reorganization of natural resources functions within the Federal government. The Council will retain the functions it now has under NEPA and Executive Order No. 11514 with the exception of routine review of the adequacy of impact statements and the administrative aspects of their receipt and handling. The EPA will take over CEQ's evaluation responsibility under the Federal Nonnuclear Energy Research Development Act of 1974 [section 5901 et seq. of Title 42, The Public Health and Welfare]. The CEQ will continue to review and publish the Annual Report on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p class="note-body">The strength of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEQ) lies in its economic analysis of current policy choices. It also presents objective economic data, makes macroeconomic forecasts, and analyzes economic trends and their impact on the national economy. It will continue with a small reduction in staff.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) should retain those science, engineering, and technology functions which can be so useful in helping the President and his advisers make decisions about policy and budget issues. Instead of the Intergovernmental Science, Engineering, and Technology Advisory Panels, the President should rely on an intergovernmental relations working group, chaired by the Science Adviser. The Federal Coordinating Council on Science and Technology should operate as a sub-Cabinet working group chaired by the Science Adviser. The reorganization work of the President's Committee on Science and Technology would be part of the overall reorganization effort. The responsibility for preparing certain reports should be transferred to the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposal places manageable limits on OSTP's broad mandate while emphasizing functions that support the President.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Office of the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations (STR) is now operating effectively and will be retained essentially as is. With the difficult negotiations now underway in Geneva, the benefits of transferring the STR to another agency are outweighed by the potential reduction in its effectiveness as an international negotiator.</p>
<p class="note-body">The National Security Council (NSC) will be retained in its present form and its staff slightly reduced.</p>
<p class="note-body">Intelligence Oversight Board (IOB) should be retained to insure that abuses of the past are not repeated and to emphasize Presidential concerns regarding intelligence issues.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Council of Wage and Price Stability (COWPS) is a necessary weapon in the continuing fight against inflation and will be retained. To be sure that its work is closely coordinated with the economic analyses performed by the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), COWPS should be directed by the Chairman of CEA.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">iii. centralize administrative functions</h4>
<p class="note-body">About 380 (22 percent) of the full-time, permanent EOP personnel perform administrative support services in EOP units. Most EOP units besides the White House and OMB are too small to provide a full complement of administrative services. They depend on the White House, OMB, GSA, other federal departments, or several of these sources for many of these services. This approach is inefficient; the quality is uneven and the coordination poor. Some services are duplicated, others inconsistently distributed (excess capacity in some units and deficiencies in others), and most too costly.</p>
<p class="note-body">I propose to combine administrative support operations into a Central Administrative Unit in EOP to provide support in administrative services common to all EOP entities. It should be a separate EOP entity because of the need to assure equal access by all other units.</p>
<p class="note-body">This consolidation will result in:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Saving of roughly 40 positions and about $1.1 million, improved and more innovative services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">A focus for monitoring the efficiency and responsibility of administrative services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">A base for an effective EOP budget/planning system through which the President can manage an integrated EOP rather than a collection of disparate units.</p>
<p class="note-body">The EOP has never before been organized as a single, unified entity serving the President. It is only by viewing it as a whole that we can improve efficiency through steps like the Central Administrative Unit.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">iv. reduce the size of white house and eop staffs</h4>
<p class="note-body">I am reducing the White House staff by 28 percent, from the 485 I inherited from my predecessor to 351. This involves cuts in my policy and administrative staffs as well as transfers to the Central Administrative Unit.</p>
<p class="note-body">I estimate that this plan and the other steps I am taking will reduce staff levels in the EOP by about 250, from 1,712 full-time permanent positions to about 1,460 and will save the taxpayers at least $6 million.</p>
<p class="note-body">As in the rest of the government, I will be reluctant to add staff unless necessary to help me do my job better.</p>
<p class="note-body">I ask that you support me in improving the operations of the Executive Office of the President by approving the attached reorganization plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">In summary this plan would:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Abolish the Domestic Council and establish a Domestic Policy Staff.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Establish within the EOP a Central Administrative Unit.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Transfer certain functions of the Council on Environmental Quality to the President for redelegation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Abolish the Office of Drug Abuse Policy and vest functions in the President for redelegation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Abolish the Office of Telecommunications Policy and transfer functions to the Department of Commerce and to the President for redelegation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:11 --><p class="note-body-1em">Create an Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Vest some Office of Science and Technology Policy functions in the President for redelegation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Abolish the Economic Opportunity Council and vest those functions in the President for redelegation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Transfer the Committee Management Secretariat function of the Office of Management and Budget to the President for redelegation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Make other incidental transfers attendant to those mentioned above.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each of the changes set forth in the plan accompanying this message is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of Title 5 of the United States Code. I have taken care to determine that all functions abolished by the plan are done so only under statutory authority provided by Section 903(b) of Title 5 of the United States Code. The provisions in the plan for the appointment and pay of any head or officer of any agency have been found by me to be necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">As we continue our studies of other parts of the Executive Branch, we will find more ways to improve services in the EOP and elsewhere.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. About 80 percent of Americans live in urban areas, and the economic health and social vitality of our urban communities are critically important to the prosperity and quality of life for Americans. Vibrant cities spawn innovation, economic growth, and cultural enrichment through the businesses, universities, and civic, cultural, religious, and nonprofit institutions they attract. Forward-looking policies that encourage wise investment and development in our urban areas will create employment and housing opportunities and make our country more competitive, prosperous, and strong. In the past, insufficient attention has been paid to the problems faced by urban areas and to coordinating the many Federal programs that affect our cities. A more comprehensive approach is needed, both to develop an effective strategy for urban America and to coordinate the actions of the many executive departments and agencies whose actions impact urban life.</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) to work with executive departments and agencies to ensure that appropriate consideration is given by such departments and agencies to the potential impact of their actions on urban areas;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) to work with executive departments and agencies, including the Office of Management and Budget, to ensure that Federal Government dollars targeted to urban areas are effectively spent on the highest-impact programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) to engage in outreach and work closely with State and local officials, with nonprofit organizations, and with the private sector, both in seeking input regarding the development of a comprehensive urban policy and in ensuring that the implementation of Federal programs advances the objectives of that policy.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Coordination</em>. In performing its functions, the Office shall work closely with all relevant executive departments and agencies, and offices and councils within the Executive Office of the President, including but not limited to:</p>

<h4 class="note-head">White House Task Force on Middle-Class Working Families</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 5979, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">For many years, middle-class Americans have been working harder, yet not enjoying their fair share of the fruits of a growing economy. While the productivity of the American workforce grew during the decade ending in 2007, middle-income workers saw their real incomes fall. The current economic situation has exacerbated the challenges facing middle-class Americans, with health care coverage, safe and steady employment opportunities, effective and affordable education, owning a home, and saving for retirement slipping out of reach. It is a high priority of my Administration to achieve a secure future for middle-class working families, one in which they share in prosperous times and are cushioned during hard times. To these ends, I hereby direct the following:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>White House Task Force on Middle-Class Working Families</em>. There is established within the Office of the Vice President, a White House Task Force on <!-- PDFPage:16 -->Middle-Class Working Families (Task Force) to focus on raising the living standards of middle-class working families in the United States of America.

<p class="note-body">(3) the Department of Health and Human Services;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) the Department of Education;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) the Office of Management and Budget;</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) the National Economic Council;</p>
<p class="note-body">(7) the Domestic Policy Council;</p>
<p class="note-body">(8) the Council of Economic Advisers; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(9) such other executive branch departments, agencies, or offices as the President may designate.</p>
<p class="note-body">A member of the Task Force may designate, to perform the Task Force functions of the member, any person who is a part of the member's department, agency, or office, and who is a full-time officer or employee of the Federal Government. At the direction of the Chair, the Task Force may establish subgroups consisting exclusively of Task Force members or their designees under this section, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <cap-smallcap>Administration of the Task Force</cap-smallcap>. The Department of Labor shall provide funding and administrative support for the Task Force to the extent permitted by law and within existing appropriations. The Vice President shall designate an Executive Director of the Task Force, who shall coordinate the work of the Task Force.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Mission and Functions of the Task Force</em>. The Task Force shall work with a wide array of executive departments and agencies that have responsibility for key issues facing middle-class working families, expedite administrative reforms, propose Executive Orders, and develop legislative and policy proposals that can be of special importance to middle-class working families.

<p class="note-body">(c) restore labor standards, including workplace safety;</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) protect the incomes of middle-class working families; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) protect retirement security.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Outreach</em>. Consistent with the objectives set out in section 2 of this memorandum, the Task Force, in accordance with applicable law, in addition to regular meetings, shall conduct outreach with representatives of labor, business, nonprofit organizations, State and local government agencies, and other interested persons that will assist with the Task Force's development of a detailed set of recommendations.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Transparency and Reports</em>. The Task Force shall facilitate the posting on the Internet of submissions by outside parties and engage in an open, two-way dialogue with the American people.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>General Provisions</em>. (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall assist and provide information to the Task Force, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the functions of the Task Force.
