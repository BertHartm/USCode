<p class="statutory-body">The District Courts of the United States, and the United States court for any Territory, of the District where the offense is committed or threatened or of which the offender is an inhabitant or has his principal place of business, are vested with jurisdiction of any suit brought by the Attorney General in the name of the United States, to prevent and restrain violations of any of the provisions of this subchapter. Any person violating any of the provisions of section 203 or 205 of this title shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof be fined not more than $1,000 for each offense. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized, with respect to any violation of this subchapter, to compromise the liability arising with respect to such violation (1) upon payment of a sum not in excess of $500 for each offense, to be collected by the Secretary and to be paid into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts, and (2) in case of repetitious violations and in order to avoid multiplicity of criminal proceedings, upon agreement to a stipulation, that the United States may, on its own <!-- PDFPage:14 -->motion upon five days&rsquo; notice to the violator, cause a consent decree to be entered by any court of competent jurisdiction enjoining the repetition of such violation.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Codification</h4>
<p class="note-body">As originally enacted this section contained a reference to the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia. Act June 25, 1936, substituted &ldquo;the district court of the United States for the District of Columbia&rdquo; for &ldquo;the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia&rdquo;, and act June 25, 1948, as amended by act May 24, 1949, substituted &ldquo;United States District Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; for &ldquo;district court of the United States for the District of Columbia&rdquo;. However, the words &ldquo;United States District Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; have been deleted entirely as superfluous in view of section 132(a) of Title 28, Judiciary and Judicial Procedure, which states that &ldquo;There shall be in each judicial district a district court which shall be a court of record known as the United States District Court for the district&rdquo;, and section 88 of Title 28 which states that &ldquo;the District of Columbia constitutes one judicial district&rdquo;.</p>
