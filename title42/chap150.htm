<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) aeronautics research and development; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) scientific research, which shall include, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) robotic missions to study the Moon and other planets and their moons, and to deepen understanding of astronomy, astrophysics, and other areas of science that can be productively studied from space;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) earth science research and research on the Sun-Earth connection through the development and operation of research satellites and other means;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) support of university research in space science, earth science, and microgravity science; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) research on microgravity, including research that is not directly related to human exploration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consultation and coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the programs of NASA, the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consult and coordinate to the extent appropriate with other relevant Federal agencies, including through the National Science and Technology Council;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) work closely with the private sector, including by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) encouraging the work of entrepreneurs who are seeking to develop new means to launch satellites, crew, or cargo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) contracting with the private sector for crew and cargo services, including to the International Space Station, to the extent practicable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) using commercially available products (including software) and services to the extent practicable to support all NASA activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) encouraging commercial use and development of space to the greatest extent practicable; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) involve other nations to the extent appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Vision for space exploration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall establish a program to develop a sustained human presence on the Moon, including a robust precursor program, to promote exploration, science, commerce, and United States preeminence in space, and as a stepping-stone to future exploration of Mars and other destinations. The Administrator is further authorized to develop and conduct appropriate international collaborations in pursuit of these goals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Milestones</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall manage human space flight programs to strive to achieve the following milestones (in conformity with section 16763 of this title)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Returning Americans to the Moon no later than 2020.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Launching the Crew Exploration Vehicle as close to 2010 as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Increasing knowledge of the impacts of long duration stays in space on the human body using the most appropriate facilities available, including the ISS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Enabling humans to land on and return from Mars and other destinations on a timetable that is technically and fiscally possible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Aeronautics</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President of the United States, through an official the President shall designate, and in consultation with appropriate Federal agencies, shall develop a national policy to guide the aeronautics research and development programs of the United States through 2020. The policy shall include national goals for aeronautics research and development and shall describe the role and responsibilities of each Federal agency that will carry out the policy. The development of the policy shall utilize external studies that have been conducted on the state of United States aeronautics and aviation research and development and have suggested policies to ensure continued competitiveness.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Content</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) At a minimum, the national aeronautics research and development policy shall describe for NASA&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the priority areas of research for aeronautics through fiscal year 2011;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the basis on which and the process by which priorities for ensuing fiscal years will be selected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the facilities and personnel needed to carry out the aeronautics program through fiscal year 2011; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth's atmosphere several times in the Earth's history and pose a similar threat in the future.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects&rsquo; closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section the term &ldquo;near-Earth object&rdquo; means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Near-Earth Object Survey</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Survey program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after December 30, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Fifth-year report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 28 of the fifth year after December 30, 2005, a report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A summary of all activities taken pursuant to paragraph (1) since December 30, 2005.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A summary of expenditures for all activities pursuant to paragraph (1) since December 30, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Initial report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall transmit to Congress not later than 1 year after December 30, 2005, an initial report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A recommended option and proposed budget to carry out the Survey program pursuant to the recommended option.</p>
