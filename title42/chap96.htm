<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary of Energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to sections 8835 and 8836 of this title, the Secretary of Energy may commit to guarantee, and guarantee, against loss on up to 90 per centum of the principal and interest, any loan which is made solely to provide funds for the construction of a municipal waste energy project and which does not exceed 90 per centum of the cost of the construction of the project involved, as estimated by the Secretary on the date of the guarantee or commitment to guarantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Estimated project construction costs as determinative of revised amount of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event the total estimated costs of construction of the project thereafter exceed the total estimated costs initially determined by the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary may in addition, upon application therefor, guarantee, against loss on up to 90 per centum of the principal and interest, a loan for so much of the additional estimated total costs as does not exceed 10 per centum of the total estimated costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The terms and conditions of loan guarantees under this section shall provide that, if the Secretary of Energy makes a payment of principal or interest upon the default by a borrower, the Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the recipient of such payment (and such subrogation shall be expressly set forth in the loan guarantee or related agreements).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Termination, cancellation, or revocation, and conclusive nature of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any loan guarantee under this section shall not be terminated, canceled, or otherwise revoked, except in accordance with the terms thereof and shall be conclusive evidence that such guarantee complies fully with the provisions of this chapter and of the approval and legality of the principal amount, interest rate, and all other terms of the securities, obligations, or loans and of the guarantee.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5432 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment to lender</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary of Energy determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the borrower is unable to meet payments and is not in default,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is in the public interest to permit the borrower to continue to pursue the purposes of such project, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the probable net benefit to the United States in paying the principal and interest due under a loan guarantee agreement will be greater than that which would result in the event of a default,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the Secretary may pay to the lender under a loan guarantee agreement an amount not greater than the principal and interest which the borrower is obligated to pay to such lender, if the borrower agrees to reimburse the Secretary for such payment on terms and conditions, including interest, which the Secretary determines are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Preconditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A loan may not be guaranteed under this section unless the applicant for such loan has established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy that the lender is not willing without such a guarantee to extend credit to the applicant at reasonable rates and terms, taking into consideration prevailing market rates and terms for loans for similar periods of time, to finance the construction of the project for which such loan is sought.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment of interest; tax consequences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to any loan or debt obligation which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) issued after June 30, 1980, by, or on behalf of, any State or any political subdivision or governmental entity thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy under this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not supported by the full faith and credit of the issuer as a general obligation of the issuer,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the interest paid on such obligation and received by the purchaser thereof (or the purchaser's successors in interest) shall be included in gross income for the purposes of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to the amount of obligations described in paragraph (1) that the issuer would have been able to issue as tax exempt obligations (other than obligations secured by the full faith and credit of the issuer as a general obligation of the issuer), the Secretary of Energy is authorized to pay only to the issuer any portion of the interest on such obligations, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking into account the interest rate which would have been paid on the obligations had they been issued as tax exempt obligations without being so guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy and the interest rate actually paid on the obligations when issued as taxable obligations. Such payments shall be made in amounts determined by the Secretary of Energy, and in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A fee or fees may be charged and collected by the Secretary of Energy for any loan guarantee under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of such fee shall be based on the estimated administrative costs and risk of loss, except that such fee may not exceed 1 per centum of the maximum of the guarantee.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 271 of the Energy Security Act (94 Stat. 710; Public Law 96&ndash;294; 42 U.S.C. 8871), in order to require Federal agencies which own or lease motor vehicles to use gasohol in those vehicles which are capable of operating on gasohol where it is available at reasonable prices and in reasonable quantities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;101. In procurement actions for unleaded gasoline motor fuel, Federal agencies shall, whenever feasible, specify that gasohol is an acceptable substitute motor fuel. In such procurements there shall be a preference for the purchase of gasohol.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;102. Agencies may procure the components of gasohol and do their own blending.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;103. In determining the feasibility of specifying gasohol as a substitute motor fuel in procurement actions <!-- PDFPage:5438 -->for unleaded gasoline, agencies shall include in their considerations such factors as the availability of storage facilities for bulk purchases and the number of vehicles capable of operating on gasohol.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;104. Agencies shall designate those vehicles which are capable of using gasohol, consistent with overall agency needs and sound vehicle management practices. Agencies shall specify the conditions governing the use of gasohol, including when gasohol shall be purchased from normal retail outlets by vehicle operators.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;105. The use of gasohol by the Department of Defense pursuant to this Order shall be in accordance with Section 815 of the Department of Defense Authorization Act, 1980 (93 Stat. 817; Public Law 96&ndash;107; 10 U.S.C. 2388 note) which provides for the use of gasohol to the maximum extent feasible and consistent with overall defense needs and sound vehicle management practices, as determined by the Secretary of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;106. Vehicles used in experimental programs to test fuels other than gasohol are excepted from this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;107. The authority vested in the President by Section 271(b) of the Energy Security Act (42 U.S.C. 8871(b)) is delegated to the Secretary of Defense with respect to gasohol use by the Department of Defense, and delegated to the Administrator of General Services with respect to gasohol use by other agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;108. Federal agencies shall make available to the Department of Energy, upon request, relevant data or information they possess concerning agency gasohol usage.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;109. For purposes of this Order &ldquo;Gasohol&rdquo; means a motor fuel which has an octane rating of not less than 87 (R+M)/2 and which consists of approximately 90 percent unleaded gasoline and approximately 10 percent anhydrous (199 proof or above) ethyl alcohol derived from biomass, as defined in Section 203(2)(A) of the Energy Security Act (94 Stat. 683; Public Law 96&ndash;294; 42 U.S.C. 8802(2)(A)).</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;110. (a) The Secretary of Defense with respect to gasohol use by the Department of Defense, and the Administrator of General Services with respect to gasohol use by other agencies, shall issue such guidelines for the implementation of this Order as they deem appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Such guidelines shall provide for a determination of reasonable prices and reasonable quantities based on the local prevailing price of unleaded gasolines, the octane requirements for vehicles in the Federal fleet, local market availability of gasohol or its components, and other such factors, as may be appropriate.</p>
