<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States commercial launch industry is technically capable of providing reliable and cost efficient access to space and is an essential component of national efforts to assure access to space for Government and commercial users;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Federal Government should encourage, facilitate, and promote the United States commercial launch industry, including the development and enhancement of commercial launch facilities, in order to ensure United States economic preeminence in space;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the interests of the United States will be served if the commercial launch industry is competitive in the international marketplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) commercial vehicles are effective means to challenge foreign competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the use by the Federal Government of performance specifically in lieu of detailed specifications relating to vehicle design, construction, and operation will facilitate the efficient operation of the United States commercial launch industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the procurement of commercial launch services in a commercially reasonable manner permits a reduced level of Federal Government regulation and oversight and economies of scale which may result in significant cost savings to the commercial launch industry and to the United States.<sup><a href="#2465b_1_target" name="2465b_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) it is the general policy of the Federal Government to purchase needed goods and services, including launch services, from the private sector to the fullest extent feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) predictable access to National Aeronautics and Space Administration launch markets would encourage continuing United States private sector investment in space and related activities.</p>
