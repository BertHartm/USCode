<h4 class="note-head">Perinatal Transmission of HIV Disease; Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 7(a) of Pub. L. 104&ndash;146 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Research studies and statewide clinical experiences have demonstrated that administration of anti-retroviral medication during pregnancy can significantly reduce the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus (commonly known as HIV) from an infected mother to her baby.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that all pregnant women receive HIV counseling; voluntary, confidential HIV testing; and appropriate medical treatment (including anti-retroviral therapy) and support services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The provision of such testing without access to such counseling, treatment, and services will not improve the health of the woman or the child.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The provision of such counseling, testing, treatment, and services can reduce the number of pediatric cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, can improve access to and provision of medical care for the woman, and can provide opportunities for counseling to reduce transmission among adults, and from mother to child.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The provision of such counseling, testing, treatment, and services can reduce the overall cost of pediatric cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The cancellation or limitation of health insurance or other health coverage on the basis of HIV status should be impermissible under applicable law. Such cancellation or limitation could result in disincentives for appropriate counseling, testing, treatment, and services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) For the reasons specified in paragraphs (1) through (6)&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) routine HIV counseling and voluntary testing of pregnant women should become the standard of care; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the relevant medical organizations as well as public health officials should issue guidelines making such counseling and testing the standard of care.&rdquo;</p>
