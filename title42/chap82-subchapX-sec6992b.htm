The program shall (1) provide for tracking of the transportation of the waste from the generator to the disposal facility, except that waste that is incinerated need not be tracked after incineration, (2) include a system for providing the generator of the waste with assurance that the waste is received by the disposal facility, (3) use a uniform form for tracking in each of the demonstration States, and (4) include the following requirements:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A requirement for placement of the waste in containers that will protect waste handlers and the public from exposure.</p>
