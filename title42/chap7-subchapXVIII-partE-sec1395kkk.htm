<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established an independent board to be known as the &ldquo;Independent Payment Advisory Board&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section to, in accordance with the following provisions of this section, reduce the per capita rate of growth in Medicare spending&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by requiring the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to determine in each year to which this section applies (in this section referred to as &ldquo;a determination year&rdquo;) the projected per capita growth rate under Medicare for the second year following the determination year (in this section referred to as &ldquo;an implementation year&rdquo;);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the projection for the implementation year exceeds the target growth rate for that <!-- PDFPage:3269 -->year, by requiring the Board to develop and submit during the first year following the determination year (in this section referred to as &ldquo;a proposal year&rdquo;) a proposal containing recommendations to reduce the Medicare per capita growth rate to the extent required by this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by requiring the Secretary to implement such proposals unless Congress enacts legislation pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Board proposals</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Development</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Board shall develop detailed and specific proposals related to the Medicare program in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Advisory reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Beginning January 15, 2014, the Board may develop and submit to Congress advisory reports on matters related to the Medicare program, regardless of whether or not the Board submitted a proposal for such year. Such a report may, for years prior to 2020, include recommendations regarding improvements to payment systems for providers of services and suppliers who are not otherwise subject to the scope of the Board's recommendations in a proposal under this section. Any advisory report submitted under this subparagraph shall not be subject to the rules for congressional consideration under subsection (d). In any year (beginning with 2014) that the Board is not required to submit a proposal under this section, the Board shall submit to Congress an advisory report on matters related to the Medicare program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Proposals</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each proposal submitted under this section in a proposal year shall meet each of the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) If the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has made a determination under paragraph (7)(A) in the determination year, the proposal shall include recommendations so that the proposal as a whole (after taking into account recommendations under clause (v)) will result in a net reduction in total Medicare program spending in the implementation year that is at least equal to the applicable savings target established under paragraph (7)(B) for such implementation year. In determining whether a proposal meets the requirement of the preceding sentence, reductions in Medicare program spending during the 3-month period immediately preceding the implementation year shall be counted to the extent that such reductions are a result of the implementation of recommendations contained in the proposal for a change in the payment rate for an item or service that was effective during such period pursuant to subsection (e)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The proposal shall not include any recommendation to ration health care, raise revenues or Medicare beneficiary premiums under section 1395i&ndash;2, 1395i&ndash;2a, or 1395r of this title, increase Medicare beneficiary cost-sharing (including deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments), or otherwise restrict benefits or modify eligibility criteria.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) In the case of proposals submitted prior to December 31, 2018, the proposal shall not include any recommendation that would reduce payment rates for items and services furnished, prior to December 31, 2019, by providers of services (as defined in section 1395x(u) of this title) and suppliers (as defined in section 1395x(d) of this title) scheduled, pursuant to the amendments made by section 3401 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, to receive a reduction to the inflationary payment updates of such providers of services and suppliers in excess of a reduction due to productivity in a year in which such recommendations would take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) As appropriate, the proposal shall include recommendations to reduce Medicare payments under parts C and D, such as reductions in direct subsidy payments to Medicare Advantage and prescription drug plans specified under paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395kkk_1_target" name="1395kkk_1">1</a></sup> (1) and (2) of section 1395w&ndash;115(a) of this title that are related to administrative expenses (including profits) for basic coverage, denying high bids or removing high bids for prescription drug coverage from the calculation of the national average monthly bid amount under section 1395w&ndash;113(a)(4) of this title, and reductions in payments to Medicare Advantage plans under clauses (i) and (ii) of section 1395w&ndash;23(a)(1)(B) of this title that are related to administrative expenses (including profits) and performance bonuses for Medicare Advantage plans under section 1395w&ndash;23(n)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395kkk_2_target" name="1395kkk_2">2</a></sup> of this title. Any such recommendation shall not affect the base beneficiary premium percentage specified under 1395w&ndash;113(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395kkk_3_target" name="1395kkk_3">3</a></sup> of this title or the full premium subsidy under section 1395w&ndash;114(a) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) The proposal shall only include recommendations related to the Medicare program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) If the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has made a determination described in subsection (e)(3)(B)(i)(II) in the determination year, the proposal shall be designed to help reduce the growth rate described in paragraph (8) while maintaining or enhancing beneficiary access to quality care under this subchapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3270 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In developing and submitting each proposal under this section in a proposal year, the Board shall, to the extent feasible&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) take into account the data and findings contained in the annual reports under subsection (n) in order to develop proposals that can most effectively promote the delivery of efficient, high quality care to Medicare beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No increase in total Medicare program spending</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each proposal submitted under this section shall be designed in such a manner that implementation of the recommendations contained in the proposal would not be expected to result, over the 10-year period starting with the implementation year, in any increase in the total amount of net Medicare program spending relative to the total amount of net Medicare program spending that would have occurred absent such implementation.</p>
