<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 180 days after September 13, 1994, the Attorney General shall develop, in cooperation with the States, a national voluntary motor vehicle theft prevention program (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;program&rdquo;) under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the owner of a motor vehicle may voluntarily sign a consent form with a participating State or locality in which the motor vehicle owner&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) states that the vehicle is not normally operated under certain specified conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) agrees to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) display program decals or devices on the owner's vehicle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) permit law enforcement officials in any State to stop the motor vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether the vehicle is being operated by or with the permission of the owner, if the vehicle is being operated under the specified conditions; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) participating States and localities authorize law enforcement officials in the State or locality to stop motor vehicles displaying program decals or devices under specified conditions and take reasonable steps to determine whether the vehicle is being operated by or with the permission of the owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniform decal or device designs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The motor vehicle theft prevention program developed pursuant to this section shall include a uniform design or designs for decals or other devices to be displayed by motor vehicles participating in the program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) clearly state that participation in the program is voluntary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) clearly explain that participation in the program means that, if the participating vehicle is being operated under the specified conditions, law enforcement officials may stop the vehicle and take reasonable steps to determine whether it is being operated by or with the consent of the owner, even if the law enforcement officials have no other basis for believing that the vehicle is being operated unlawfully;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include an express statement that the vehicle is not normally operated under the specified conditions and that the operation of the vehicle under those conditions would provide sufficient grounds for a prudent law enforcement officer to reasonably believe that the vehicle was not being operated by or with the consent of the owner; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the operation of the vehicle during certain hours of the day; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the operation of the vehicle under other circumstances that would provide a sufficient basis for establishing a reasonable suspicion that the vehicle was not being operated by the owner, or with the consent of the owner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) More than one set of conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General may establish more than one set of conditions under which participating motor vehicles may be stopped. If more than one set of conditions is established, a separate consent form and a separate design for program decals or devices shall be established for each set of conditions. The Attorney General may choose to satisfy the require<!-- PDFPage:6128 -->ment of a separate design for program decals or devices under this paragraph by the use of a design color that is clearly distinguishable from other design colors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No new conditions without consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the program has begun, the conditions under which a vehicle may be stopped if affixed with a certain decal or device design may not be expanded without the consent of the owner.</p>
