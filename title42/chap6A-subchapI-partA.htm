<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1966, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended, and providing for reorganization of health functions of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare.</p>
<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-end:notes -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">I</h4>
<p class="note-body">Today we face new challenges and unparalleled opportunities in the field of health. Building on the progress of the past several years, we have truly begun to match the achievements of our medicine to the needs of our people.</p>
<p class="note-body">The task ahead is immense. As a nation, we will unceasingly pursue our research and learning, our training and building, our testing and treatment. But now our concern must also turn to the organization of our Federal health programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">As citizens we are entitled to the very best health services our resources can provide.</p>
<p class="note-body">As taxpayers, we demand the most efficient and economic health organizations that can be devised.</p>
<p class="note-body">I ask the Congress to approve a reorganization plan to bring new strength to the administration of Federal health programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">I propose a series of changes in the organization of the Public Health Service that will bring to all Americans a structure modern in design, more efficient in operation and better prepared to meet the great and growing needs of the future. Through such improvements we can achieve the full promise of the landmark health legislation enacted by the 89th Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">I do not propose these changes lightly. They follow a period of careful deliberation. For many months the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Surgeon General have consulted leading experts in the Nation&mdash;physicians, administrators, scientists, and public health specialists. They have confirmed my belief that modernization and reorganization of the Public Health Service are urgently required and long overdue.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">II</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Public Health Service is an operating agency of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. It is the principal arm of the Federal Government in the field of health. Its programs are among those most vital to our well-being.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since 1953 more than 50 new programs have been placed in the Public Health Service. Its budget over the past 12 years has increased tenfold&mdash;from $250 million to $2.4 billion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today the organization of the Public Health Service is clearly obsolete. The requirement that new and expanding programs be administered through an organizational structure established by law more than two decades ago stands as a major obstacle to the fulfillment of our Nation's health goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">As presently constituted, the Public Health Service is composed of four major components:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Bureau of State Services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Bureau of Medical Services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Office of the Surgeon General.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Under present law, Public Health Service functions must be assigned only to these four components.</p>
<p class="note-body">This structure was designed to provide separate administrative arrangements for health research, programs of State and local aid, health services, and executive staff resources. At a time when these functions could be neatly compartmentalized, the structure was adequate. But today the situation is different.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under recent legislation many new programs provide for an integrated attack on specific disease problems or health hazards in the environment by combining health services, State and local aid, and research. Each new program of this type necessarily is assigned to one of the three operating components of the Public Health Service. Yet none of these components is intended to administer programs involving such a variety of approaches.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:46 --><p class="note-body">Our health problems are difficult enough without having them complicated by outmoded organizational arrangements.</p>
<p class="note-body">But if we merely take the step of integrating the four agencies within the Public Health Service we will not go far enough. More is required.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">III</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare performs major health or health-related functions which are not carried out through the Public Health Service, although they are closely related to its functions. Among these are:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Health insurance for the aged, administered through the Social Security Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Medical assistance for the needy, administered through the Welfare Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Regulation of the manufacture, labeling, and distribution of drugs, carried out through the Food and Drug Administration; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Grants-in-aid to States for vocational rehabilitation of the handicapped, administered by the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Expenditures for health and health-related programs of the Department administered outside the Public Health Service have increased from $44 million in 1953 to an estimated $5.4 billion in 1967.</p>
<p class="note-body">As the head of the Department, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is responsible for the Administration and coordination of all the Department's health functions. He has clear authority over the programs I have just mentioned.</p>
<p class="note-body">But today he lacks this essential authority over the Public Health Service. The functions of that agency are vested in the Surgeon General and not in the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">This diffusion of responsibility is unsound and unwise.</p>
<p class="note-body">To secure the highest possible level of health services for the American people the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare must be given the authority to establish&mdash;and modify as necessary&mdash;the organizational structure for Public Health Service programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">He must also have the authority to coordinate health functions throughout the Department. The reorganization plan I propose will accomplish these purposes. It will provide the Secretary with the flexibility to create new and responsive organizational arrangements to keep pace with the changing and dynamic nature of our health programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">My views in this respect follow a basic principle of good government set by the Hoover Commission in 1949 when it recommended that &ldquo;the Department head should be given authority to determine the organization within his Department.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">IV</h4>
<p class="note-body">In summary, the reorganization plan would:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Transfer to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare the functions now vested in the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service and in its various subordinate units (this transfer will not affect certain statutory advisory bodies such as the National Advisory Cancer and Heart Councils);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Abolish the four principal statutory components of the Public Health Service, including the offices held by their heads (the Bureau of Medical Services, the Bureau of State Services, the National Institutes of Health exclusive of its several research institutes such as the National Cancer and Heart Institutes, and the Office of the Surgeon General); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Authorize the Secretary to assign the functions transferred to him by the plan to officials and entities of the Public Health Service and to other agencies of the Department as he deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thus, the Secretary would be&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Enabled to assure that all health functions of the Department are carried out as effectively and economically as possible;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Given authority commensurate with his responsibility; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Made responsible in fact for matters for which he is now, in any case, held accountable by the President, the Congress, and the people.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">V</h4>
<p class="note-body">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">Should the reorganizations in the accompanying reorganization plan take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of the affected health programs. It is, however, not practicable at this time to itemize the reductions in expenditures which may result.</p>
<p class="note-body">I strongly recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;210b. Professional categories</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Division of corps; basis of categories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of establishing eligibility of officers of the Regular Corps for promotions, the Surgeon General shall by regulation divide the corps into professional categories. Each category shall, as far as practicable, be based upon one of the subjects of examination set forth in section 209(a)(1) of this title or upon a subdivision of such subject, and the categories shall be designed to group officers by fields of training in such manner that officers in any one grade in any one category will be available for similar duty in the discharge of the several functions of the Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assignment of officers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each officer of the Regular Corps on active duty shall, on the basis of his training and experience, be assigned by the Surgeon General to one of the categories established by regulations under subsection (a) of this section. Except upon amendment of such regulations, no assignment so made shall be changed unless the Surgeon General finds (1) that the original assignment was erroneous, or (2) that the officer is equally well qualified to serve in another category to which he has requested to be transferred, and that such transfer is in the interests of the Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maximum number of officers in each category</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within the limits fixed by the Secretary in regulations under section 207(d) of this title for any fiscal year, the Surgeon General shall determine for each category in the Regular Corps the maximum number of officers authorized to be in each of the grades from the warrant officer (W&ndash;1) grade to the director grade, inclusive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Vacancies in grade for purposes of promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The excess of the number so fixed for any grade in any category over the number of officers of the Regular Corps on active duty in such grade in such category (including in the case of the director grade, officers holding such grade in accordance with section 207(c) of this title) shall for the purpose of promotions constitute vacancies in such grade in such category. For purposes of this subsection, an officer who has been temporarily promoted or who is temporarily holding the grade of director in accordance with section 207(c) of this title shall be deemed to hold the grade to which so promoted or which he is temporarily holding; but while he holds such promotion or grade, and while any officer is temporarily assigned to a position pursuant to section 206(c) of this title, the number fixed under subsection (c) of this section for the grade of his permanent rank shall be reduced by one.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Absence of vacancy in grade as affecting promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The absence of a vacancy in a grade in a category shall not prevent an appointment to such grade pursuant to section 209 of this title, a permanent length of service promotion, or the recall of a retired officer to active duty; but the making of such an appointment, promotion, or recall shall be deemed to fill a vacancy if one exists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Vacancy in grade as affecting maximum number for each category</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a vacancy exists in any grade in a category the Surgeon General may increase by one the number fixed by him under subsection (c) of this section for the next lower grade in the same category, without regard to the numbers fixed in regulations under section 207(d) of this title; and in that event the vacancy in the higher grade shall not be filled except by a permanent promotion, and upon the making of such promotion the number for the next lower grade shall be reduced by one.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;211. Promotion of commissioned officers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Permanent or temporary promotions; examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Promotions of officers of the Regular Corps to any grade up to and including the director grade shall be either permanent promotions based on length of service, other permanent promotions to fill vacancies, or temporary promotions. Permanent promotions shall be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and temporary promotions shall be made by the President. Each permanent promotion shall be to the next higher grade, and shall be made only after examination given in accordance with regulations of the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Promotion to certain grades only to fill vacancies; regulations; &ldquo;restricted grade&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may by regulation provide that in a specified professional category permanent promotions to the senior grade, or to both the full grade and the senior grade, shall be made only if there are vacancies in such grade. A grade in any category with respect to which such regulations have been issued is referred to in this section as a &ldquo;restricted grade&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Examinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Examinations to determine qualification for permanent promotions may be either noncompetitive or competitive, as the Surgeon General shall in each case determine; except that examinations for promotions to the assistant or senior assistant grade shall in all cases be noncompetitive. The officers to be examined shall be selected by the Surgeon General from the professional category, and in the order of seniority in the grade, from which promotion is to be recommended. In the case of a competitive examination the Surgeon General shall determine in advance of the examination the number (which may be one or more) of officers who, after passing the examination, will be recommended to the President for promotion; but if the examination is one for promotions based on length of service, or is one for promotions to fill vacancies other than vacancies in the director grade or in a restricted grade, such number shall not be less than 80 per centum of the number of officers to be examined.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Permanent promotions to qualified officers on length of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Officers of the Regular Corps, found pursuant to subsection (c) of this section to be qualified, shall be given permanent promotions based on length of service, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Officers in the warrant officer (W&ndash;1) grade, chief warrant officer (W&ndash;2) grade, chief warrant officer (W&ndash;3) grade, chief warrant officer (W&ndash;4) grade, and junior assistant grade shall be promoted at such times as may be prescribed in regulations of the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Officers with permanent rank in the assistant grade, the senior assistant grade, and the full grade shall (except as provided in regulations under subsection (b) of this section) be promoted after completion of three, ten, and seventeen years, respectively, of service in grades above the junior assistant grade; and such promotions, when made, shall be effective, for purposes of pay and seniority in grade, as of the day following the completion of such years of service. An officer with permanent rank in the assistant, senior assistant, or full grade who has not completed such years of service shall be promoted at the same time, and his promotion shall be effective as of the same day, as any officer junior to him in the same grade in the same professional category who is promoted under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Promotion of professional category officers to fill certain vacancies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Officers in a professional category of the Regular Corps, found pursuant to subsection (c) of this section to be qualified, may be given permanent promotions to fill any or all vacancies in such category in the senior assistant grade, the full grade, the senior grade, or the director grade; but no officer who has not had one year of service with permanent or temporary rank in the next lower grade shall be promoted to any restricted grade or to the director grade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reexamination upon failure of promotion; effective date of promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an officer who has completed the years of service required for promotion to a grade under paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of this section fails to receive such promotion, he shall (unless he has already been twice examined for promotion to such grade) be once reexamined for promotion to such grade. If he is thereupon promoted (otherwise than under subsection (e) of this section), the effective date of such promotion shall be one year later than it would have been but for such failure. Upon the effective date of any permanent promotion of such <!-- PDFPage:61 -->officer to such grade, he shall be considered as having had only the length of service required for such promotion which he previously failed to receive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Separation from service upon failure of promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, for reasons other than physical disability, an officer of the Regular Corps in the warrant officer (W&ndash;1) grade or junior assistant grade is found pursuant to subsection (c) of this section not to be qualified for promotion he shall be separated from the Service. If, for reasons other than physical disability, an officer of the Regular Corps in the chief warrant officer (W&ndash;2), chief warrant officer (W&ndash;3), assistant, senior assistant, or full grade, after having been twice examined for promotion (other than promotion to a restricted grade), fails to be promoted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if in the chief warrant officer (W&ndash;2) or assistant grade he shall be separated from the Service and paid six months&rsquo; basic pay and allowances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if in the chief warrant officer (W&ndash;3) or senior assistant grade he shall be separated from the Service and paid one year's basic pay and allowances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if in the full grade he shall be considered as not in line for promotion and shall, at such time thereafter as the Surgeon General may determine, be retired from the Service with retired pay (unless he is entitled to a greater amount by reason of another provision of law)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of an officer who first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980, at the rate of 21/2 percent of the retired pay base determined under section 1406(h) of title 10 for each year, not in excess of 30, of his active commissioned service in the Service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an officer who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after September 8, 1980, at the rate determined by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the retired pay base determined under section 1407 of title 10; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of such title for the number of years of his active commissioned service in the Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Separation from service upon refusal to stand examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an officer of the Regular Corps, eligible to take an examination for promotion, refuses to take such examination, he may be separated from the Service in accordance with regulations of the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Review of record; separation from service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of his first three years of service, the record of each officer of the Regular Corps originally appointed to the senior assistant grade or above, shall be reviewed in accordance with regulations of the President and, if found not qualified for further service, he shall be separated from the Service and paid six months&rsquo; pay and allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Determination of order of seniority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The order of seniority of officers in a grade in the Regular Corps shall be determined, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, by the relative length of time spent in active service after the effective date of each such officer's original appointment or permanent promotion to that grade. When permanent promotions of two or more officers to the same grade are effective on the same day, their relative seniority shall be the same as it was in the grade from which promoted. In all other cases of original appointments or permanent promotions (or both) to the same grade effective on the same day, relative seniority shall be determined in accordance with regulations of the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an officer originally appointed in the Regular Corps to the grade of assistant or above, his seniority in the grade to which appointed shall be determined after inclusion, as service in such grade, of any active service in such grade or in any higher grade in the Reserve Corps, but (if the appointment is to the grade of senior assistant or above) only to the extent of whichever of the following is greater: (A) His active service in such grade or any higher grade in the Reserve Corps after the first day on which, under regulations in effect on the date of his appointment to the Regular Corps, he had the training and experience necessary for such appointment, or (B) the excess of his total active service in the Reserve Corps (above the grade of junior assistant) over three years if his appointment in the Regular Corps is to the senior assistant grade, over ten years if the appointment is to the full grade, or over seventeen years if the appointment is to the senior grade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Temporary promotions; fill vacancy in higher grade; war or national emergency; selection of officers; termination of appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any commissioned officer of the Regular Corps in any grade in any professional category may be recommended to the President for temporary promotion to fill a vacancy in any higher grade in such category, up to and including the director grade. In time of war, or of national emergency proclaimed by the President, any commissioned officer of the Regular Corps in any grade in any professional category may be recommended to the President for promotion to any higher grade in such category, up to and including the director grade, whether or not a vacancy exists in such grade. The selection of officers to be recommended for temporary promotions shall be made in accordance with regulations of the President. Promotion of an officer recommended pursuant to this subsection may be made without regard to length of service, without examination, and without vacating his permanent appointment, and shall carry with it the pay and allowances of the grade to which promoted. Such promotions may be terminated at any time, as may be directed by the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Determination of requirements of Service by Secretary; assignment of Reserve Officers to professional categories; temporary promotions; termination of temporary promotions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the number of officers of the Regular Corps on active duty, plus the number of officers of the Reserve Corps who have been on active duty for thirty days or more, exceeds the <!-- PDFPage:62 -->authorized strength of the Regular Corps, the Secretary shall determine the requirements of the Service in each grade in each category, based upon the total number of officers so serving on active duty and the tasks being performed by the Service; and the Surgeon General shall thereupon assign each officer of the Reserve Corps on active duty to a professional category. If the Secretary finds that the number of officers fixed under section 210b(c) of this title for any grade and category (or the number of officers, including officers of the Reserve Corps, on active duty in such grade in such category, if such number is greater than the number fixed under section 210b(c) of this title) is insufficient to meet such requirements of the Service, officers of either the Regular Corps or the Reserve Corps may be recommended for temporary promotion to such grade in such category. Any such promotion may be terminated at any time, as may be directed by the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Acceptance of promotion; oath and affidavit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer of the Regular Corps, or any officer of the Reserve Corps on active duty, who is promoted to a higher grade shall, unless he expressly declines such promotion, be deemed for all purposes to have accepted such promotion; and shall not be required to renew his oath of office, or to execute a new affidavit as required by section 3332 of title 5.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:64 --><p class="statutory-body">(6) The retired pay of a commissioned officer retired under this subsection who first became a member of a uniformed service after September 7, 1980, is determined by multiplying&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the basic pay of the highest grade to which a commissioned officer has received a temporary promotion means the basic pay to which he would be entitled if serving on active duty in such grade on the date of his retirement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recall to active duty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A commissioned officer, retired for reasons other than for failure of promotion to the senior grade, may (1) if an officer of the Regular Corps or an officer of the Reserve Corps entitled to retired pay under subsection (a) of this section, be involuntarily recalled to active duty during such times as the Commissioned Corps constitutes a branch of the land or naval forces of the United States, and (2) if an officer of either the Regular or Reserve Corps, be recalled to active duty at any time with his consent.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Retirement or separation for physical disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of retirement or separation for physical disability under chapter 61 of title 10, a commissioned officer of the Service shall be credited, in addition to the service described in section 1208(a)(2) of that title, with active service with the Public Health Service, other than as a commissioned officer, which the Surgeon General determines is comparable to service performed by commissioned officers of the Service, except that, if there are more than five years of such service, only the last five years thereof may be so credited. For such purposes, such section 1208(a)(2) shall be applicable to officers of the Regular or Reserve Corps of the Service.</p>

Any such person against whom such civil action or proceeding is brought shall deliver within such time after date of service or knowledge of service as determined by the Attorney General, all process served upon him or an attested true copy thereof to his immediate superior or to whomever was designated by the Secretary to receive such papers and such person shall promptly furnish copies of the pleading and process therein to the United States attorney for the district embracing the place wherein the proceeding is brought, to the Attorney General, and to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Removal to United States district court; procedure; proceeding upon removal deemed a tort action against United States; hearing on motion to remand to determine availability of remedy against United States; remand to State court or dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon a certification by the Attorney General that the defendant was acting in the scope of his employment at the time of the incident out of which the suit arose, any such civil action or proceeding commenced in a State court shall be removed without bond at any time before trial by the Attorney General to the district court of the United States of the district and division embracing the place wherein it is pending and the proceeding deemed a tort action brought against the United States under the provisions of title 28 and all references thereto. Should a United States district court determine on a hearing on a motion to remand held before a trial on the merit that the case so removed is one in which a remedy by suit within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section is not available against the United States, the case shall be remanded to the State Court: <em>Provided</em>, That where such a remedy is precluded because of the availability of a remedy through proceedings for compensation or other benefits from the United States as provided by any other law, the case shall be dismissed, but in the event the running of any limitation of time for commencing, or filing an application or claim in, such proceedings for compensation or other benefits shall be deemed to have been suspended during the pendency of the civil action or proceeding under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compromise or settlement of claim by Attorney General</h4>

The remedy against the United States for an entity described in paragraph (4) and any officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor (subject to paragraph (5)) of such an entity who is deemed to be an employee of the Public Health Service pursuant to this paragraph shall be exclusive of any other civil action or proceeding to the same extent as the remedy against the United States is exclusive pursuant to subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The deeming of any entity or officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor of the entity to be an employee of the Public Health Service for purposes of this section shall apply with respect to services provided&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to all patients of the entity, and</p>

The determination of the Secretary that an entity or an officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor of the entity is deemed to be an employee of the Public Health Service for purposes of this section shall apply for the period specified by the Secretary under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Once the Secretary makes a determination that an entity or an officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor of an entity is deemed to be an employee of the Public Health Service for purposes of this section, the determination shall be final and binding upon the Secretary and the Attorney General and other parties to any civil action or proceeding. Except as provided in subsection (i) of this section, the Secretary and the Attorney General may not determine that the provision of services which are the subject of such a determination are not covered under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The Secretary may not consider the entity in making estimates under subsection (k)(1) of this section.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(H) In the case of an entity described in paragraph (4) for which an application under subparagraph (D) is in effect, the entity may, through notifying the Secretary in writing, elect to terminate the applicability of this subsection to the entity.

<!-- PDFPage:81 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Upon the effective date for the election, clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (G) apply to the entity to the same extent and in the same manner as such clauses apply to an entity that has not submitted an application under subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) If after making the election the entity submits an application under subparagraph (D), the election does not preclude the Secretary from approving the application (&nbsp;<sup><a href="#233_2_target" name="233_2">2</a></sup>&nbsp;and thereby restoring the applicability of this subsection to the entity and each officer, governing board member, employee, and contractor of the entity, subject to the provisions of this subsection and the subsequent provisions of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, with respect to an entity or person deemed to be an employee for purposes of paragraph (1), a cause of action is instituted against the United States pursuant to this section, any claim of the entity or person for benefits under an insurance policy with respect to medical malpractice relating to such cause of action shall be subrogated to the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has a history of claims filed against him or her as provided for under this section that is outside the norm for licensed or certified health care practitioners within the same specialty;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) amounts in the fund established under paragraph (2) but unspent from prior fiscal years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to appropriations, for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall establish a fund of an amount equal to the amount estimated under paragraph (1) that is attributable to entities receiving funds under each of the grant programs described in paragraph (4) of subsection (g) of this section, but not to exceed a total of $10,000,000 for each such fiscal year. Appropriations for purposes of this paragraph shall be made separate from appropriations made for purposes of sections 254b, 254b and 256a of this title.<sup><a href="#233_1_target" name="233_1">1</a></sup></p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Timely response to filing of action or proceeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a civil action or proceeding is filed in a State court against any entity described in subsection (g)(4) of this section or any officer, governing board member, employee, or any contractor of such an entity for damages described in subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General, within 15 days after being notified of such filing, shall make an appearance in such court and advise such court as to whether the Secretary has determined under subsections (g) and (h) of this section, that such entity, officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor of the entity is deemed to be an employee of the Public Health Service for purposes of this section with respect to the actions or omissions that are the subject of such civil action or proceeding. Such advice shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of subsection (c) of this section that the Attorney General certify that an entity, officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor of the entity was acting within the scope of their employment or responsibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Attorney General fails to appear in State court within the time period prescribed under paragraph (1), upon petition of any entity or officer, governing board member, employee, or contractor of the entity named, the civil action or proceeding shall be removed to the appropriate United States district court. The civil action or proceeding shall be stayed in such court until such court conducts a hearing, and makes a determination, as to the appropriate forum or procedure for the assertion of the claim for damages described in subsection (a) of this section and issues an order consistent with such determination.</p>

Any plan which is found by the Secretary on the record, after notice and an opportunity for a full and fair hearing, to have violated this subsection shall upon such finding cease, for a period to be determined by the Secretary, to receive and to be eligible to receive any Federal funds under titles XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;managed care plan&rdquo; shall mean health maintenance organizations and similar entities that contract at-risk with payors for the provision of health services or plan enrollees and which contract with providers (such as entities described in subsection (g)(4) of this section) for the delivery of such services to plan enrollees.</p>
