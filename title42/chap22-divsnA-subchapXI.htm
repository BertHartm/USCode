<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Continuous review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall maintain a continuous review of Restricted Data and of any Classification Guides issued for the guidance of those in the atomic energy program with respect to the areas of Restricted Data which have been declassified in order to determine which information may be declassified and removed from the category of Restricted Data without undue risk to the common defense and security.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Joint determination on atomic weapons; Presidential determination on disagreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of Restricted Data which the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly determine to relate primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons, the determination that such data may be published without constituting an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security shall be made by the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly, and if the Commission and the Department of Defense do not agree, the determination shall be made by the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Removal from Restricted Data category</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall remove from the Restricted Data category such data as the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly determine relates primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons and which the Commission and Department of Defense jointly determine can be adequately safeguarded as defense information: <em>Provided, however,</em> That no such data so removed from the Restricted Data category shall be transmitted or otherwise made available to any nation or regional defense orga<!-- PDFPage:2801 -->nization, while such data remains defense information, except pursuant to an agreement for cooperation entered into in accordance with subsection (b) or (d) of section 2164 of this title.</p>
