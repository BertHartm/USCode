<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such a loan may be made only to a student who (A) is in need of the amount of the loan to pursue a full-time or half-time course of study at the school leading to a baccalaureate or associate degree in nursing or an equivalent degree, or a diploma in nursing, or a graduate degree in nursing, (B) is capable, in the opinion of the school, of maintaining good standing in such course of study, and (C) with respect to any student enrolling in the school after June 30, 1986, is of financial need (as defined in regulations issued by the Secretary);;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_2_target" name="297b_2">2</a></sup></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of a student who received such a loan before September 29, 1979, an amount up to 85 per centum of any such loan made before such date (plus interest thereon) shall be canceled for full-time employment as a professional nurse (including teaching in any of the fields of nurse training and service as an administrator, supervisor, or consultant in any of the fields of nursing) in any public or nonprofit private agency, institution, or organization (including neighborhood health centers), at the rate of 15 per centum of the amount of such loan (plus interest) unpaid on the first day of such service for each of the first, second, and third complete year of such service, and 20 per centum of such amount (plus interest) for each complete fourth and fifth year of such service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the liability to repay the unpaid balance of such loan and accrued interest thereon shall be canceled upon the death of the borrower, or if the Secretary determines that he has become permanently and totally disabled;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such a loan shall bear interest on the unpaid balance of the loan, computed only for periods during which the loan is repayable, at the rate of 5 percent per annum;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such a loan shall be made without security or endorsement, except that if the borrower is a minor and the note or other evidence of obligation executed by him would not, under the applicable law, create a binding obligation, either security or endorsement may be required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) no note or other evidence of any such loan may be transferred or assigned by the school making the loan except that, if the borrower transfers to another school participating in the program under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> such note or other evidence of a loan may be transferred to such other school; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) pursuant to uniform criteria established by the Secretary, the repayment period established under paragraph (2) for any student borrower who during the repayment period failed to make consecutive payments and who, during the last 12 months of the repayment period, has made at least 12 consecutive payments may be extended for a period not to exceed 10 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cancellation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where all or any part of a loan, or interest, is canceled under this section, the Secretary shall pay to the school an amount equal to the school's proportionate share of the canceled portion, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Installments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any loan for any year by a school from a student loan fund established pursuant to an agreement under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> shall be made in such installments as may be provided in regulations of the Secretary or such agreement and, upon notice to the Secretary by the school that any recipient of a loan is failing to maintain satisfactory standing, any or all further installments of his loan shall be withheld, as may be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability to eligible students in need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An agreement under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> with any school shall include provisions designed to make loans from the student loan fund established thereunder reasonably available (to the extent of the available funds in such fund) to all eligible students in the school in need thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Penalty for late payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to regulations of the Secretary and in accordance with this section, a school shall as<!-- PDFPage:747 -->sess a charge with respect to a loan from the loan fund established pursuant to an agreement under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> for failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when it is due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment of the loan under subsection (b)(2) of this section or cancellation of part or all of the loan under subsection (b)(3) of this section, for any failure to file timely and satisfactory evidence for such entitlement. No such charge may be made if the payment of such installment or the filing of such evidence is made within 60 days after the date on which such installment or filing is due. The amount of any such charge may not exceed an amount equal to 6 percent of the amount of such installment. The school may elect to add the amount of any such charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the first day after the day on which such installment or evidence was due, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school not later than the due date of the next installment after receipt by the borrower of notice of the assessment of the charge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Minimum monthly repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A school may provide in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, that during the repayment period of a loan from a loan fund established pursuant to an agreement under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> payments of principal and interest by the borrower with respect to all the outstanding loans made to him from loan funds so established shall be at a rate equal to not less than $40 per month.</p>
