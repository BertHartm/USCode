<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to provide diagnosis, and treatment and services (including counseling, substance abuse treatment, education, job training and placement assistance while under correctional supervision, and linkage to similar outside services), to increase the success rate of offenders who decide to pursue a course of lawful and productive conduct after release from legal restraint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to reduce criminal recidivism by offenders who receive punishment through such alternatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to reduce the cost of correctional services and facilities by reducing criminal recidivism; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Selection of grantees</h4>

In selecting the applicants to receive grants under subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Director shall&mdash;</p>
