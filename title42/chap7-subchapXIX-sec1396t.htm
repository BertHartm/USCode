<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reviews of providers</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The certification under this subsection with respect to a provider of home or community care must be based on a periodic review of the provider's performance in providing the care required under ICCP's in accordance with the requirements of subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special reviews of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a provider of home or community care with any of the requirements of subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a review of the provider and, on the basis of that review, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the provider meets such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Surveys of community care settings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The certification under this subsection with respect to community care settings must be based on a survey. Such survey for such a setting must be conducted without prior notice to the setting. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a community care setting of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title. The Secretary shall review each State's procedures for scheduling and conducting such surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Survey protocol</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Validation surveys of community care settings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of community care settings in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under subparagraph (A) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State's surveys conducted under subparagraph (A). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under subparagraph (B). If the State has determined that an individual setting meets the requirements of subsection (g) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the setting does not meet such requirements, the Secretary's determination as to the setting's noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special surveys of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a community care setting with any of the requirements of subsection (g) or (h) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the setting and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the setting meets such requirements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State shall provide, through the agency responsible for surveys and certification of providers of home or community care and community care settings under this sub<!-- PDFPage:2727 -->section, for a process for the receipt, review, and investigation of allegations of individual neglect and abuse (including injuries of unknown source) by individuals providing such care or in such setting and of misappropriation of individual property by such individuals. The State shall, after notice to the individual involved and a reasonable opportunity for hearing for the individual to rebut allegations, make a finding as to the accuracy of the allegations. If the State finds that an individual has neglected or abused an individual receiving community care or misappropriated such individual's property, the State shall notify the individual against whom the finding is made. A State shall not make a finding that a person has neglected an individual receiving community care if the person demonstrates that such neglect was caused by factors beyond the control of the person. The State shall provide for public disclosure of findings under this paragraph upon request and for inclusion, in any such disclosure of such findings, of any brief statement (or of a clear and accurate summary thereof) of the individual disputing such findings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a State finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a provider of home or community care has provided care of substandard quality with respect to an individual, the State shall make a reasonable effort to notify promptly (I) an immediate family member of each such individual and (II) individuals receiving home or community care from that provider under this subchapter, or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Enforcement process for providers of community care</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) State authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a State finds, on the basis of a review under subsection (i)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a provider of home or community care no longer meets the requirements of this section, the State may terminate the provider's participation under the State plan and may provide in addition for a civil money penalty. Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to a State to remedy a provider's deficiencies. If the State finds that a provider meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(A) for the period during which it finds that the provider was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Civil money penalty</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each State shall establish by law (whether statute or regulation) at least the following remedy: A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the provider is or was out of compliance with a requirement of this section. Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty under subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section) may be applied to reimbursement of individuals for personal funds lost due to a failure of home or community care providers to meet the requirements of this section. The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how this remedy is to be applied and the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the penalties and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Deadline and guidance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each State which elects to provide home and community care under this section must establish the civil money penalty remedy described in clause (i) applicable to all providers of community care covered under this section. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations or otherwise by not later than July 1, 1990, guidance to States in establishing such remedy; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Secretarial authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) For State providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a State provider of home or community care, the Secretary shall have <!-- PDFPage:2728 -->the authority and duties of a State under this subsection, except that the civil money penalty remedy described in subparagraph (C) shall be substituted for the civil money remedy described in paragraph (1)(B)(i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to any other provider of home or community care in a State, if the Secretary finds that a provider no longer meets a requirement of this section, the Secretary may terminate the provider's participation under the State plan and may provide, in addition, for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C). If the Secretary finds that a provider meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C) for the period during which the Secretary finds that the provider was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Civil money penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary finds on the basis of a review under subsection (i)(2) of this section or otherwise that a home or community care provider no longer meets the requirements of this section, the Secretary shall impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title. The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how this remedy is to be applied and the amounts of any penalties. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the penalties and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe penalties for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Secretarial responsibilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Publication of interim requirements</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimum protections</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Development of final requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall develop, by not later than October 1, 1992&mdash;</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, an election period is the period of 4 or more calendar quarters elected by the State, and approved by the Secretary, for the provision of home and community care under this section.</p>
