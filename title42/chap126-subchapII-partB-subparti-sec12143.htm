<p class="statutory-body">It shall be considered discrimination for purposes of section 12132 of this title and section 794 of title 29 for a public entity which operates a fixed route system (other than a system which provides solely commuter bus service) to fail to provide with respect to the operations of its fixed route system, in accordance with this section, paratransit and other special transportation services to individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, that are sufficient to provide to such individuals a level of service (1) which is comparable to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system; or (2) in the case of response time, which is comparable, to the extent practicable, to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after July 26, 1990, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to carry out this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Required contents of regulations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible recipients of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under this section shall require each public entity which operates a fixed route system to provide the paratransit and other special transportation services required under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) to any individual with a disability who is unable, as a result of a physical or mental impairment (including a vision impairment) and without the assistance of another individual (except an operator of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device), to board, ride, or disembark from any vehicle on the system which is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to any individual with a disability who needs the assistance of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device (and is able with such assistance) to board, ride, and disembark from any vehicle which is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if the individual wants to travel on a route on the system during the hours of operation of the system at a time (or within a reasonable period of such time) when such a vehicle is not being used to provide designated public transportation on the route; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) to any individual with a disability who has a specific impairment-related condition which prevents such individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location on such system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to one other individual accompanying the individual with the disability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to other individuals, in addition to the one individual described in subparagraph (B), accompanying the individual with a disability provided that space for these additional individuals is available on the paratransit vehicle carrying the individual with a disability and that the transportation of such additional individuals will not result in a denial of service to individuals with disabilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under this section shall provide that, if the public entity is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the provision of paratransit and other special transportation services otherwise required under this section would impose an undue financial burden on the public entity, the public entity, notwithstanding any other provision of this section (other than paragraph (5)), shall only be required to provide such services to the extent that providing such services would not impose such a burden.</p>
