<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to establish a demonstration program to test the effectiveness of combining housing certificates and vouchers with supportive services to assist frail elderly persons to continue to live independently. The demonstration program under this section shall terminate upon the expiration of the 5-year period determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Housing assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with this demonstration, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may enter into contracts with public housing agencies to provide not more than 1,500 incremental vouchers and certificates under sections 1437f(b) and 1437f(<em>o</em>) of this title. A public housing agency may not require that a frail elderly person live in a particular structure or unit, but the agency may restrict the program under this section to a geographic area, where necessary to ensure that the provision of supportive services is feasible. At the end of the demonstration period, the public housing agency shall give each frail elderly person the option to continue to receive assistance under the housing certificate or voucher program of the agency. In the demonstration, the Secretary may also provide for supportive services in connection with existing contracts for housing assistance under sections 1437f(b) and 1437f(<em>o</em>) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Supportive services requirements and matching funding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal, PHA and,<sup><a href="#8012_1_target" name="8012_1">1</a></sup> individual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount estimated by the public housing agency and approved by the Secretary as necessary to provide the supportive services for the demonstration period shall be funded as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary shall provide 40 percent, using amounts appropriated under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The public housing agency shall ensure the provision of at least 50 percent from sources other than under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each frail elderly person shall pay 10 percent of the costs of the supportive services that the person receives, except that a frail elderly person may not be required to pay an amount that exceeds 20 percent of the adjusted income (as the term is defined in section 1437a(b)(5) of this title) of such person and the Secretary shall provide for the waiver of the requirement to pay costs under this subparagraph for persons whose income is determined to be insufficient to provide for any payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) To the extent that the limitation under subparagraph (C) regarding the percentage of income frail elderly persons may pay for services will result in collected amounts for any public housing agency of less than 10 percent of the cost of providing the services, 50 percent of such remaining costs shall be provided by the public housing agency and 50 percent of such remaining costs shall be provided by the Secretary from amounts appropriated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Provision of services for entire demonstration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency shall ensure that supportive services appropriate to the needs of the frail elderly persons to be served under this demonstration are provided throughout the demonstration period. Expenditures for supportive services need not be made in equal amounts for each year, but may vary depending on the needs of the frail elderly persons assisted under this section. A public housing agency may use up to 20 percent of the Federal assistance provided for supportive services in each year of this demonstration and any amounts from any prior year in which the public housing agency did not use 20 percent of the available Federal assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Calculation of match</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining compliance with paragraph (1)(B), an agency may include the value of such items as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, which may include the salary paid to staff to provide supportive services, if such items have a readily discernible market value.</p>
