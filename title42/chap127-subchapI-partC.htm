<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) over the past 10 years, parents have increasingly come together with other parents to organize family resource and support programs that promote healthy child development and increase parental competency, particularly families at risk; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Federal investment in promoting the development of family resource and support programs will reap long-term benefits for individual families and the nation as a whole.</p>
