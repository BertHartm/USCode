The term &ldquo;eligible entity&rdquo; also includes any limited purpose agency designated under title II of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2781 et seq.] for fiscal year 1981 which served the general purposes of a community action agency under title II of such Act, unless such designated agency lost its designation under title II of such Act as a result of a failure to comply with the provisions of such Act, any grantee which received financial assistance under section 222(a)(4) of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2809(a)(4)] in fiscal year 1981, and any organization to which a State which applied for and received a waiver from the Secretary under Public Law 98&ndash;139 made a grant under this Act in fiscal year 1984.
