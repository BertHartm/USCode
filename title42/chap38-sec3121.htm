<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the maintenance of the national economy at a high level is vital to the best interests of the United States, but that some of our regions, counties, and communities are suffering substantial and persistent unemployment and underemployment; that such unemployment and underemployment cause hardship to many individuals and their families, and waste invaluable human resources; that to overcome this problem the Federal Government, in cooperation with the States, should help areas and regions of substantial and persistent unemployment and underemployment to take effective steps in planning and financing their public works and economic development; that Federal financial assistance, including grants for public <!-- PDFPage:3154 -->works and development facilities to communities, industries, enterprises, and individuals in areas needing development should enable such areas to help themselves achieve lasting improvement and enhance the domestic prosperity by the establishment of stable and diversified local economies and improved local conditions, provided that such assistance is preceded by and consistent with sound, long-range economic planning; and that under the provisions of this chapter new employment opportunities should be created by developing and expanding new and existing public works and other facilities and resources rather than by merely transferring jobs from one area of the United States to another. Congress further declares that, in furtherance of maintaining the national economy at a high level, the assistance authorized by this chapter should be made available to both rural and urban areas; that such assistance be available for planning for economic development prior to the actual occurrences of economic distress in order to avoid such condition; and that such assistance be used for long-term economic rehabilitation in areas where long-term economic deterioration has occurred or is taking place.</p>
