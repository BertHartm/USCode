<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct a program to demonstrate electric motor vehicles and the associated equipment of such vehicles, in consultation with the Electric and Hybrid Vehicle Program Site Operators, manufacturers, the electric utility industry, and such other persons as the Secretary considers appropriate. Such program shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) designed to accelerate the development and use of electric motor vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) structured to evaluate the performance of such electric motor vehicles in field operation, including fleet operation, and evaluate the necessary supporting infrastructure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Solicitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 18 months after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall solicit proposals to demonstrate electric motor vehicles and associated equipment in one or more eligible metropolitan areas.
