<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of the Congress in this chapter to reduce the risks of life and property from future earthquakes in the United States through the establishment and maintenance of an effective earthquake hazards reduction program. The objectives of such program shall include&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5626 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the education of the public, including State and local officials, as to earthquake phenomena, the identification of locations and structures which are especially susceptible to earthquake damage, ways to reduce the adverse consequences of an earthquake, and related matters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the development of technologically and economically feasible design and construction methods and procedures to make new and existing structures, in areas of seismic risk, earthquake resistant, giving priority to the development of such methods and procedures for power generating plants, dams, hospitals, schools, public utilities and other lifelines, public safety structures, high occupancy buildings, and other structures which are especially needed in time of disaster;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the implementation to the greatest extent practicable, in all areas of high or moderate seismic risk, of a system (including personnel, technology, and procedures) for predicting damaging earthquakes and for identifying, evaluating, and accurately characterizing seismic hazards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the development, publication, and promotion, in conjunction with State and local officials and professional organizations, of model building codes and other means to encourage consideration of information about seismic risk in making decisions about land-use policy and construction activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the development, in areas of seismic risk, of improved understanding of, and capability with respect to, earthquake-related issues, including methods of mitigating the risks from earthquakes, planning to prevent such risks, disseminating warnings of earthquakes, organization emergency services, and planning for reconstruction and redevelopment after an earthquake;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the development of ways to increase the use of existing scientific and engineering knowledge to mitigate earthquake hazards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the development of ways to assure the availability of affordable earthquake insurance.</p>
