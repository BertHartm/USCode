<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), an average of at least forty percent of the funds provided in a State under this part for weatherization materials, labor, and related matters described in subsection (c) of this section shall be spent for weatherization materials. Not more than an amount equal to 10 percent of any grant made by the Secretary under this part may be used for administrative purposes in carrying out duties under this part, except that not more than one-half of such amount may be used by any State for such purposes, and a State may provide in the plan adopted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for recipients of grants of less than $350,000 to use up to an additional 5 percent of such grant for administration if the State has determined that such recipient requires such additional amount to implement effectively the administrative requirements established by the Secretary pursuant to this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall approve a State's application to waive the 40-percent requirement established in paragraph (1) if the State includes in its plan energy audit procedures and techniques which (i) meet standards established by the Secretary after consultation with the State Energy Advisory Board established under section 6325(g) of this title, (ii) establish priorities for selection of weatherization measures based on their cost and contribution to energy efficiency, (iii) measure the energy requirement of individual dwellings and the rate of return of the total conservation investment in a dwelling, and (iv) account for interaction among energy efficiency measures.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4102 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make information on energy audit procedures and techniques available to States applying for a waiver under subparagraph (A) and shall provide training for State and local agencies in the implementation of such procedures and techniques.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) give priority to those States which, during such previous fiscal year, obtained a significant portion of income from non-Federal sources for their weatherization programs or increased significantly the portion of low-income weatherization assistance that the State obtained from non-Federal sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Supplementary financial assistance to grant recipients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Beginning with fiscal year 1992, the Secretary may allocate, from funds appropriated pursuant to section 6872(b) of this title, among the States an equal amount for each State not to exceed $100,000 per State.
