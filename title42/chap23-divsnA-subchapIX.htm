<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission is authorized to issue licenses to persons applying therefor to transfer or receive in interstate commerce, manufacture, produce, transfer, acquire, possess, use, import, or export under the terms of an agreement for cooperation arranged pursuant to section 2153 of this title, utilization or production facilities for industrial or commercial purposes. Such licenses shall be issued in accordance with the provisions of subchapter XV of this division and subject to such conditions as the Commission may by rule or regulation establish to effectuate the purposes and provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Nonexclusive basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall issue such licenses on a nonexclusive basis to persons applying therefor (1) whose proposed activities will serve a useful purpose proportionate to the quantities of special nuclear material or source material to be utilized; (2) who are equipped to observe and who agree to observe such safety standards to protect health and to minimize danger to life or property as the Commission may by rule establish; and (3) who agree to make available to the Commission such technical information and data concerning activities under such licenses as the Commission may determine necessary to promote the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public. All such information may be used by the Commission only for the purposes of the common defense and security and to protect the health and safety of the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) License period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each such license shall be issued for a specified period, as determined by the Commission, depending on the type of activity to be licensed, but not exceeding forty years, and may be renewed upon the expiration of such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No license under this section may be given to any person for activities which are not under or within the jurisdiction of the United States, except for the export of production or utilization facilities under terms of an agreement for cooperation arranged pursuant to section 2153 of this title, or except under the provisions of section 2139 of this title. No license may be issued to an alien or any any&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2133_1_target" name="2133_1">1</a></sup> corporation or other entity if the Commission knows or has reason to believe it is owned, controlled, or dominated by an alien, a foreign corporation, or a foreign government. In any event, no license may be issued to any person within the United States if, in the opinion of the Commission, the issuance of a license to such person would be inimical to the common defense and security or to the health and safety of the public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2133_2_target" name="2133_2">2</a></sup> Accident notification condition; license revocation; license amendment to include condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each license issued for a utilization facility under this section or section 2134(b) of this title shall require as a condition thereof that in case of any accident which could result in an unplanned release of quantities of fission products in excess of allowable limits for normal operation established by the Commission, the licensee shall immediately so notify the Commission. Violation of the condition prescribed by this subsection may, in the Commission's discretion, constitute grounds for license revocation. In accordance with section 2237 of this title, the Commission shall promptly amend each license for a utilization facility issued under this section or section 2134(b) of this title which is in effect on June 30, 1980, to include the provisions required under this subsection.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2135. Antitrust provisions governing licenses</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Violations of antitrust laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this chapter shall relieve any person from the operation of the following Acts, as amended, &ldquo;An Act to protect trade and commerce against unlawful restraints and monopolies&rdquo; approved July second, eighteen hundred and ninety; sections seventy-three to seventy-seven, inclusive, of an Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to reduce taxation, to provide revenue for the Government, and for other purposes&rdquo; approved August twenty-seven, eighteen hundred and ninety-four; &ldquo;An Act to supplement existing laws against unlawful restraints and monopolies, and for other purposes&rdquo; approved October fifteen, nineteen hundred and fourteen; and &ldquo;An Act to create a Federal Trade Commission, to defined its powers and duties, and for other purposes&rdquo; approved September twenty-six, nineteen hundred and fourteen. In the event a licensee is found by a court of competent jurisdiction, ei<!-- PDFPage:3420 -->ther in an original action in that court or in a proceeding to enforce or review the findings or orders of any Government agency having jurisdiction under the laws cited above, to have violated any of the provisions of such laws in the conduct of the licensed activity, the Commission may suspend, revoke, or take such other action as it may deem necessary with respect to any license issued by the Commission under the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reports to Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall report promptly to the Attorney General any information it may have with respect to any utilization of special nuclear material or atomic energy which appears to violate or to tend toward the violation of any of the foregoing Acts, or to restrict free competition in private enterprise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Transmissions to Attorney General of copies of license applications; publication of advice; factors considered; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall promptly transmit to the Attorney General a copy of any license application provided for in paragraph (2) of this subsection, and a copy of any written request provided for in paragraph (3) of this subsection; and the Attorney General shall, within a reasonable time, but in no event to exceed 180 days after receiving a copy of such application or written request, render such advice to the Commission as he determines to be appropriate in regard to the finding to be made by the Commission pursuant to paragraph (5) of this subsection. Such advice shall include an explanatory statement as to the reasons or basis therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) of this subsection shall apply to an application for a license to construct or operate a utilization or production facility under section 2133 of this title: <em>Provided, however</em>, That paragraph (1) shall not apply to an application for a license to operate a utilization or production facility for which a construction permit was issued under section 2133 of this title unless the Commission determines such review is advisable on the ground that significant changes in the licensee's activities or proposed activities have occurred subsequent to the previous review by the Attorney General and the Commission under this subsection in connection with the construction permit for the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to any Commission permit for the construction of a utilization or production facility issued pursuant to subsection (b) of section 2134 of this title prior to December 19, 1970, any person who intervened or who sought by timely written notice to the Commission to intervene in the construction permit proceeding for the facility to obtain a determination of antitrust considerations or to advance a jurisdictional basis for such determination shall have the right, upon a written request to the Commission, to obtain an antitrust review under this section of the application for an operating license. Such written request shall be made within 25 days after the date of initial Commission publication in the Federal Register of notice of the filing of an application for an operating license for the facility or December 19, 1970, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon the request of the Attorney General, the Commission shall furnish or cause to be furnished such information as the Attorney General determines to be appropriate for the advice called for in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Promptly upon receipt of the Attorney General's advice, the Commission shall publish the advice in the Federal Register. Where the Attorney General advises that there may be adverse antitrust aspects and recommends that there be a hearing, the Attorney General or his designee may participate as a party in the proceedings thereafter held by the Commission on such licensing matter in connection with the subject matter of his advice. The Commission shall give due consideration to the advice received from the Attorney General and to such evidence as may be provided during the proceedings in connection with such subject matter, and shall make a finding as to whether the activities under the license would create or maintain a situation inconsistent with the antitrust laws as specified in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In the event the Commission's finding under paragraph (5) is in the affirmative, the Commission shall also consider, in determining whether the license should be issued or continued, such other factors, including the need for power in the affected area, as the Commission in its judgment deems necessary to protect the public interest.
