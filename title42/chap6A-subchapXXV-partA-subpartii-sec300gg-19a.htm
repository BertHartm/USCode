<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii)(I) such services will be provided without imposing any requirement under the plan for prior authorization of services or any limitation on coverage where the provider of services does not have a contractual relationship with the plan for the providing of services that is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that apply to emergency department services received from providers who do have such a contractual relationship with the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) if such services are provided out-of-network, the cost-sharing requirement (expressed as a copayment amount or coinsurance rate) is the same requirement that would apply if such services were provided in-network;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-19a_2_target" name="300gg-19a_2">2</a></sup></p>
