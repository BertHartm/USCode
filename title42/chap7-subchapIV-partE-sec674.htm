<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction for violation of plan requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, during any quarter of a fiscal year, a State's program operated under this part is found, as a result of a review conducted under section 1320a&ndash;2a of this title, or otherwise, to have violated paragraph (18) or (23) of section 671(a) of this title with respect to a person or to have failed to implement a corrective action plan within a period of time not to exceed 6 months with respect to such violation, then, notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and any regulations promulgated under section 1320a&ndash;2a(b)(3) of this title, the Secretary shall reduce the amount otherwise payable to the State under this part, for that fiscal year quarter and for any subsequent quarter of such fiscal year, until the State program is found, as a result of a subsequent review under section 1320a&ndash;2a of this title, to have implemented a corrective action plan with respect to such violation, by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any individual who is aggrieved by a violation of section 671(a)(18) of this title by a State or other entity may bring an action seeking relief from the State or other entity in any United States district court.</p>
