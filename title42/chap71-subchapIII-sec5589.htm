<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Dissemination of information; trade secret exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall take all possible steps to assure that full and complete information with respect to the demonstrations and other activities conducted under this subchapter is made available to Federal, State, and local authorities, relevant segments of the economy, the scientific and technical community, and the public at large, both during and after the close of the <!-- PDFPage:3740 -->programs under this subchapter, with the objective of promoting and facilitating to the maximum extent feasible the early and widespread practical use of photovoltaic energy throughout the United States. Any trade secret or other proprietary information shall be exempted from such mandatory disclosure, as otherwise specified in law applicable to research, development and demonstration programs of the Department of Energy, including, but not limited to, section 5916 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Studies and investigations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) study the effect of the widespread utilization of photovoltaic systems on the existing electric utility system at varying levels of photovoltaic contribution to the system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) study and investigate the effect of utility rate structures, building codes, zoning ordinances, and other laws, codes, ordinances, and practices upon the practical use of photovoltaic systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) determine the extent to which such laws, codes, ordinances, and practices should be changed to permit or facilitate such use and the methods by which any such changes may best be accomplished; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) determine the necessity of a program of incentives to accelerate the commercial application of photovoltaic technologies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy recommendations to President and Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized and directed, within one year of November 4, 1978, to make recommendations to the President and to the Congress for Federal policies relating to barriers to the early and widespread utilization of photovoltaic systems in order to realize the goals set forth in section 5581 of this title. These recommendations shall include but not be limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the potential for integration of electricity derived from photovoltaic energy systems into the existing national grid system, including the potential of photovoltaic-generated electricity to meet the peak-load energy needs of electric utilities, load management and reliability implications of the utilization of photovoltaic electricity by utilities, the implications of utility ownership of photovoltaic components leased to others primarily for decentralized applications, the impacts of utility use of electricity derived from photovoltaic energy systems on utility rate structures, and the potential for reducing or obviating the need for energy storage components for photovoltaic energy systems through utility interface;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent of competition between firms currently engaged in the fabrication and installation of photovoltaics components and systems as it affects the character and growth potential of the American photovoltaics industry, and the likelihood that small photovoltaic firms will have reasonable opportunities to compete and participate in the various programs authorized by this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the need to identify legal alternatives to ensure access to direct sunlight for photovoltaic energy systems, the appropriate methods of encouraging the adoption of such alternatives, and the implications of widespread utilization of photovoltaic energy systems for land use and urban development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the availability of private capital at reasonable interest rates for individuals, businesses and others desiring to establish commercial enterprises to manufacture, market, install, and/or, maintain photovoltaic components and systems, or purchase and install such systems for private, industrial, agricultural, commercial or other uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the need for industry-wide warranty and reliability standards for photovoltaic energy components and systems for private sector applications, and, if appropriate, the mechanisms for establishing such standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the attainability of the goals specified in section 5581(b) of this title, and any modification of such goals which the Secretary proposes for consideration by Congress, with supporting analyses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consultation with government agencies, industry representatives, and scientific and technical community; coordination and merger of studies and reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out his functions under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the appropriate government agencies, industry representatives, and members of the scientific and technical community having expertise and interest in this area. The Secretary also shall ensure that any study or report prepared pursuant to this section is fully coordinated with and reflective of any analyses or reports prepared pursuant to the requirements in section 5556a of this title, and in the President's Solar Energy Domestic Policy Review. The Secretary, as appropriate, may merge any continuing or on-going studies under section 5556a of this title or the Domestic Policy Review with those required by this section or avoid any unnecessary duplication of effort or funding. The separate report requirements of section 5556a of this title and this section, however, shall remain in force.</p>
