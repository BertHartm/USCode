<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall respond in an expeditious and speedy manner to complaints of a substantial or serious nature that a State has failed to use funds in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or the assurances provided by the State under section 9904 of this title. For purposes of this paragraph, a violation of any one of the assurances contained in section 9904(c) of this title that constitutes a disregard of that assurance shall be considered a serious complaint.</p>
