Upon completion of any such plan, the State shall certify to the Secretary (1) that in the preparation of such State plan, the local and economic development district plans were considered and, to the fullest extent possible, such State plan is consistent with such local and economic development district plans, and (2) that such State plan is consistent with such local and economic development district plans, or, if such State plan is not consistent with such local and economic development district plans, all of the inconsistencies of the State plan with the local and economic development district plans, and the justification for each of these inconsistencies.
