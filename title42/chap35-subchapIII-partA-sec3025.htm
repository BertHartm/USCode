In any case in which a unit of general purpose local government makes application to the State agency under the preceding sentence to be designated as a planning and service area, the State agency shall, upon request, provide an opportunity for a hearing to such unit of general purpose local government. A State may designate as a planning and service area under subsection (a)(1) of this section, any region within the State recognized for purposes of areawide planning which includes one or more such units of general purpose local government when the State determines that the designation of such a regional planning and service area is necessary for, and will enhance, the effective administration of the programs authorized by this subchapter. The State may include in any planning and service area designated under subsection (a)(1) of this section such additional areas adjacent to the unit of general purpose local government or regions so designated as the State determines to be necessary for, and will enhance the effective administration of the programs authorized by this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The chief executive officer of each State in which a planning and service area crosses State boundaries, or in which an interstate Indian reservation is located, may apply to the Assistant Secretary to request redesignation as an interstate planning and service area comprising the entire metropolitan area or Indian reservation. If the Assistant Secretary approves such an application, the Assistant Secretary shall adjust the State allotments of the areas within the planning and service area in which the interstate planning and service area is established to reflect the number of older individuals within the area who will be served by an interstate planning and service area not within the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever a unit of general purpose local government, a region, a metropolitan area or an Indian reservation is denied designation under the provisions of subsection (a)(1) of this section, such unit of general purpose local government, region, metropolitan area, or Indian reservation may appeal the decision of the State agency to the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary shall afford such unit, region, metropolitan area, or Indian reservation an opportunity for a hearing. In carrying out the provisions of this paragraph, the Assistant Secretary may approve the decision of the State agency, disapprove the decision of the State agency and require the State agency to designate the unit, region, area, or Indian reservation appealing the decision as a planning and service area, or take such other action as the Assistant Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) A State which on or before October 1, 1980, had designated, with the approval of the Assistant Secretary, a single planning and service area covering all of the older individuals in the State, in which the State agency was administering the area plan, may after that date designate one or more additional planning and service areas within the State to be administered by public or private nonprofit agencies or organizations as area agencies on aging, after consider<!-- PDFPage:4060 -->ing the factors specified in subsection (a)(1)(E) of this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A State agency shall establish and follow appropriate procedures to provide due process to affected parties, if the State agency initiates an action or proceeding to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) revoke the designation of the area agency on aging under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) designate an additional planning and service area in a State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) divide the State into different planning and services&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3025_1_target" name="3025_1">1</a></sup> areas; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) otherwise affect the boundaries of the planning and service areas in the State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) allowing an appeal of the decision of the State agency in the action or proceeding to the Assistant Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) An adversely affected party involved in an action or proceeding described in clause (i) may bring an appeal described in clause (ii)(V) on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the facts and merits of the matter that is the subject of the action or proceeding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) procedural grounds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In deciding an appeal described in clause (ii)(V), the Assistant Secretary may affirm or set aside the decision of the State agency.
