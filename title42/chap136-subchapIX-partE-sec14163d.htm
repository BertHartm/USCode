<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In conducting evaluations under this subsection, the Inspector General shall give priority to States that the Inspector General determines, based on information submitted by the State and other comments provided by any other person, to be at the highest risk of noncompliance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination for statutory procedure States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each State that employs a statutory procedure described in section 14163(e)(1)(C) of this title, the Inspector General shall submit to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate, not later than the end of the first fiscal year for which such State receives funds, a determination as to whether the State is in substantial compliance with the requirements of the applicable State statute.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Comments from public</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Inspector General shall receive and consider comments from any member of the public regarding any State's compliance with the terms and conditions of a grant made under this part. To facilitate the receipt of such comments, the Inspector General shall maintain on its website a form that any member of the public may submit, either electronically or otherwise, providing comments.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Corrective action plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General, after reviewing a report under subsection (a)(1) of this section or a determination under subsection (a)(3) of this section, determines that a State is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant, the Attorney General shall consult with the appropriate State authorities to enter into a plan for corrective action. If the State does not agree to a plan for corrective action that has been approved by the Attorney General within 90 days after the submission of the report under subsection (a)(1) of this section or the determination under subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Attorney General shall, within 30 days, issue guidance to the State regarding corrective action to bring the State into compliance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 90 days after the earlier of the implementation of a corrective action plan or the issuance of guidance under paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall submit a report to the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate as to whether the State has taken corrective action and is in compliance with the terms and conditions of the grant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Penalties for noncompliance</h4>

Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent a State which has been subject to penalties for noncompliance from reapplying for a grant under this part in another fiscal year.</p>
