<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preferences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of making grants under subsection (a) of this section, the Attorney General shall give preference to a State that includes in the application required by section 13892 of this title assurances that if the State receives a grant&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) give written notice to a prisoner, not later than 30 days after the State first receives a grant under subsection (a) of this section or 30 days after the prisoner is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 7 years (whichever is later), of the proposed or current operation of the project;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) for the purposes of selecting eligible offenders to participate in such project, the State has authorized State courts to sentence an eligible offender directly to a community correctional facility, provided that the court gives assurances that the offender would have otherwise served a term of imprisonment.</p>
