<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cost and performance goals</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out programs authorized by this section, during each of calendar years 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2016, and during each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2021, the Secretary shall identify cost and performance goals for coal-based technologies that would permit the continued cost-competitive use of coal for the production of electricity, chemical feedstocks, and transportation fuels.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In establishing the cost and performance goals, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider activities and studies undertaken as of August 8, 2005, by industry in cooperation with the Department in support of the identification of the goals;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, and every 4 years thereafter, submit to Congress a report describing the final cost and performance goals for the technologies that includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a list of technical milestones; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an explanation of how programs authorized in this section will not duplicate the activities authorized under the Clean Coal Power Initiative authorized under subchapter IV.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Powder River Basin and Fort Union lignite coal mercury removal</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the programs authorized by subsection (a), the Secretary shall establish a program to test and develop technologies to control and remove mercury emissions from subbituminous coal mined in the Powder River Basin, and Fort Union lignite coals, that are used for the generation of electricity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Efficacy of mercury removal technology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the program under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall examine the efficacy of mercury removal technologies on coals described in that paragraph that are blended with other types of coal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fuel cells</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
