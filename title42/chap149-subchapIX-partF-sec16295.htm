<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of oil and gas, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) exploration and production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) gas hydrates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reservoir life and extension;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) transportation and distribution infrastructure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ultraclean fuels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) heavy oil, oil shale, and tar sands; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) related environmental research.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The objectives of this program shall include advancing the science and technology available to domestic petroleum producers, particularly independent operators, to minimize the economic dislocation caused by the decline of domestic supplies of oil and natural gas resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Natural gas and oil deposits report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 2 years after August 8, 2005, and every 2 years thereafter, the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with other appropriate Federal agencies, shall submit to Congress a report on the latest estimates of natural gas and oil reserves, reserves growth, and undiscovered resources in Federal and State waters off the coast of Louisiana, Texas, Alabama, and Mississippi.</p>
