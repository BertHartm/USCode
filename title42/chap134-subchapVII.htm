<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an identification of all applicable Federal authorities needed to achieve the purposes of this section, and of any inadequacies in those authorities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Secretarial consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing the least-cost energy strategy, the Secretary shall give full consideration to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the relative costs of each energy and energy efficiency resource based upon a comparison of all direct and quantifiable net costs for the resource over its available life, including the cost of production, transportation, distribution, utilization, waste management, environmental compliance, and, in the case of imported energy resources, maintaining access to foreign sources of supply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the economic, energy, social, environmental, and competitive consequences resulting from the establishment of any particular order of Federal priority as determined under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The least-cost energy strategy shall identify Federal priorities, including policies that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) implement standards for more efficient use of fossil fuels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) increase the energy efficiency of existing technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage technologies, including clean coal technologies, that generate lower levels of greenhouse gases;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) encourage the development of energy technologies, such as advanced nuclear fission and nuclear fusion, that produce energy without greenhouse gases as a byproduct, and encourage the deployment of nuclear electric generating capacity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall include in the least-cost energy strategy an identification of all of the <!-- PDFPage:6799 -->assumptions used in developing the strategy and priorities thereunder, and the reasons for such assumptions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Preference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When comparing an energy efficiency resource to an energy resource, a higher priority shall be assigned to the energy efficiency resource whenever all direct and quantifiable net costs for the resource over its available life are equal to the estimated cost of the energy resource.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Public review and comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide for a period of public review and comment of the least-cost energy strategy, for a period of at least 30 days, to be completed at least 60 days before the issuance of such strategy. The Secretary shall also provide for public review and comment before the issuance of any update to the least-cost energy strategy required under this section.</p>
