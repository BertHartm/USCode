<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 180 days after June 30, 1980, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy shall jointly prepare, and transmit to the President and the Congress, a plan for maximizing in accordance with this subchapter biomass energy production and use. Such plan shall be designed to achieve a total level of alcohol production and use within the United States of at least 60,000 barrels per day of alcohol by December 31, 1982.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Comprehensive plan respecting maximized production and use from January 1, 1983, to December 31, 1990, preparation, transmission, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than January 1, 1982, the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Energy shall jointly prepare, and transmit to the President and the Congress, a comprehensive plan for maximizing in accordance with this subchapter biomass energy production and use, for the period beginning January 1, 1983, and ending December 31, 1990. Such plan shall be designed to achieve a level of alcohol production within the United States equal to at least 10 percent of the level of gasoline consumption within the United States as estimated by the Secretary of Energy for the calendar year 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The plan prepared under this subsection shall evaluate the feasibility of reaching the goals set forth in such subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) In determining the amount of financial assistance for any biomass energy project which will yield byproducts in addition to biomass energy, the Secretary shall consider the potential value of such byproducts and the costs attributable to their production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms, conditions, maturity, etc., for insured loans, and loan guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An insured loan may not be made, and a loan guarantee may not be issued, under this subchapter unless the Secretary concerned determines that the terms, conditions, maturity, security, and schedule and amounts of repayments with respect to such loan are reasonable and meet such standards as the Secretary determines are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to each biomass energy project for which financial assistance is provided under this subchapter, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) require from the recipient of financial assistance such reports and records relating to that project as the Secretary deems necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prescribe the manner in which such recipient shall keep such records; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) have access to such records at reasonable times for the purpose of ensuring compliance with the terms and conditions upon which financial assistance is provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contracts and instruments of Secretary concerned backed by full faith and credit of United States</h4>
