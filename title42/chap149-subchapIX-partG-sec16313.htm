<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, acting through the Office of Science, shall support a program of research and development in catalysis science consistent with the statutory authorities of the Department related to research and development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Components</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program shall include efforts to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) enable catalyst design using combinations of experimental and mechanistic methodologies coupled with computational modeling of catalytic reactions at the molecular level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop techniques for high throughput synthesis, assay, and characterization at nanometer and subnanometer scales in-situ under actual operating conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) synthesize catalysts with specific site architectures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) conduct research on the use of precious metals for catalysis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) translate molecular understanding to the design of catalytic compounds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duties of the Office of Science</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the program, the Director of the Office of Science shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) support both individual investigators and multidisciplinary teams of investigators to pioneer new approaches in catalytic design;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:7343 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop, plan, construct, acquire, share, or operate special equipment or facilities for the use of investigators in collaboration with national user facilities, such as nanoscience and engineering centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) support technology transfer activities to benefit industry and other users of catalysis science and engineering; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) coordinate research and development activities with industry and other Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 3 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall enter into an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) review the catalysis program to measure&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) gains made in the fundamental science of catalysis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) progress towards developing new fuels for energy production and material fabrication processes; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) submit to Congress a report describing the results of the review.</p>
