<p class="statutory-body">As used in this part&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Drinking water cooler</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;drinking water cooler&rdquo; means any mechanical device affixed to drinking water supply plumbing which actively cools water for human consumption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Lead free</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;lead free&rdquo; means, with respect to a drinking water cooler, that each part or component of the cooler which may come in contact with drinking water contains not more than 8 percent lead, except that no drinking water cooler which contains any solder, flux, or storage tank interior surface which may come in contact with drinking water shall be considered lead free if the solder, flux, or storage tank interior surface contains more than 0.2 percent lead. The Administrator may establish more stringent requirements for treating any part or component of a drinking water cooler as lead free for purposes of this part whenever he determines that any such part may constitute an important source of lead in drinking water.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Local educational agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;local educational agency&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any local educational agency as defined in section 7801 of title 20,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the governing authority of any school operating under the defense dependent's education system provided for under the Defense Dependent's Education Act of 1978 (20 U.S.C. 921 and following).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Repair</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;repair&rdquo; means, with respect to a drinking water cooler, to take such corrective action as is necessary to ensure that water cooler is lead free.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Replacement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;replacement&rdquo;, when used with respect to a drinking water cooler, means the permanent removal of the water cooler and the installation of a lead free water cooler.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) School</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;school&rdquo; means any elementary school or secondary school as defined in section 7801 of title 20 and any kindergarten or day care facility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Lead-lined tank</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;lead-lined tank&rdquo; means a water reservoir container in a drinking water cooler which container is constructed of lead or which has an interior surface which is not lead free.</p>
