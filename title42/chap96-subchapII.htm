<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The terms and conditions of loan guarantees under this section shall provide that, if the Secretary of Energy makes a payment of principal or interest upon the default by a borrower, the Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the recipient of such payment (and such subrogation shall be expressly set forth in the loan guarantee or related agreements).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Termination, cancellation, or revocation, and conclusive nature of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any loan guarantee under this section shall not be terminated, canceled, or otherwise revoked, except in accordance with the terms thereof and shall be conclusive evidence that such guarantee complies fully with the provisions of this chapter and of the approval and legality of the principal amount, interest rate, and all other terms of the securities, obligations, or loans and of the guarantee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the borrower is unable to meet payments and is not in default,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it is in the public interest to permit the borrower to continue to pursue the purposes of such project, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the probable net benefit to the United States in paying the principal and interest due under a loan guarantee agreement will be greater than that which would result in the event of a default,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the Secretary may pay to the lender under a loan guarantee agreement an amount not greater than the principal and interest which the borrower is obligated to pay to such lender, if the borrower agrees to reimburse the Secretary for such payment on terms and conditions, including interest, which the Secretary determines are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Preconditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A loan may not be guaranteed under this section unless the applicant for such loan has established to the satisfaction of the Secretary of Energy that the lender is not willing without such a guarantee to extend credit to the applicant at reasonable rates and terms, taking into consideration prevailing market rates and terms for loans for similar periods of time, to finance the construction of the project for which such loan is sought.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment of interest; tax consequences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to any loan or debt obligation which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) issued after June 30, 1980, by, or on behalf of, any State or any political subdivision or governmental entity thereof,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy under this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not supported by the full faith and credit of the issuer as a general obligation of the issuer,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the interest paid on such obligation and received by the purchaser thereof (or the purchaser's successors in interest) shall be included in gross income for the purposes of chapter 1 of title 26.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to the amount of obligations described in paragraph (1) that the issuer would have been able to issue as tax exempt obligations (other than obligations secured by the full faith and credit of the issuer as a general obligation of the issuer), the Secretary of Energy is authorized to pay only to the issuer any portion of the interest on such obligations, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury after taking into account the interest rate which would have been paid on the obligations had they been issued as tax exempt obligations without being so guaranteed by the Secretary of Energy and the interest rate actually paid on the obligations when issued as taxable obligations. Such payments shall be made in amounts determined by the Secretary of Energy, and in accordance with such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A fee or fees may be charged and collected by the Secretary of Energy for any loan guarantee under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of such fee shall be based on the estimated administrative costs and risk of loss, except that such fee may not exceed 1 per centum of the maximum of the guarantee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Priority for financial assistance under the provisions of sections 8832, 8833, and 8834 of this title and the most favorable financial terms available, shall be provided for any municipal waste energy project that will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) produce a liquid fuel from municipal waste; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will displace petroleum or natural gas as a fuel.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to projects producing biomass energy other than biomass fuel, financial assistance under the provisions of sections 8832, 8833, and 8834 of this title shall be available only if the Secretary of Energy finds that the project does not use petroleum or natural gas except for flame stabilization or start-up.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) With respect to projects producing biomass fuel, financial assistance under such provisions shall be available to such project only if the Secretary of Energy finds that the Btu content of the biomass fuel produced substantially exceeds the Btu content of any petroleum or natural gas used in the project to produce the biomass fuel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Financial assistance may not be provided under section 8832, 8833, or 8834 of this title unless the Secretary of Energy finds that necessary municipal waste feedstocks are available and it is reasonable to expect they will continue to be available for the expected economic life of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In providing financial assistance under section 8832, 8833, or 8834 of this title, the Secretary of Energy shall give due consideration to promoting competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In determining the amount of financial assistance for any municipal waste energy project which will yield byproducts in addition to biomass energy, the Secretary shall consider the value of such byproducts and the costs attributable to their production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary of Energy shall not provide financial assistance under section 8832, 8833, or 8834 of this title for any municipal waste energy unless the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the project will be technically and economically viable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the financial assistance provided encourages and supplements, but does not compete with nor supplant, any private capital investment which otherwise would be available to the proposed municipal waste energy project on reasonable terms and conditions which would permit such project to be undertaken;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) assurances are provided that the project will not use, in any substantial quantities, waste paper which would otherwise be recycled for a use other than as a fuel and will not substantially compete with facilities in existence on the date of the financial assistance which are engaged in the separation or recovery of reuseable materials from municipal waste; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that the amount of financial assistance provided for the project is not greater than is necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms, conditions, maturity, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Financial assistance may not be provided under section 8832, 8833, or 8834 of this title unless the Secretary of Energy determines that&mdash;</p>
