<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Guaranteed availability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the succeeding subsections of this section and section 300gg&ndash;44 of this title, each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage (as defined in section 300gg&ndash;91(b)(1) of this title) in the individual market in a State may not, with respect to an eligible individual (as defined in subsection (b) of this section) desiring to enroll in individual health insurance coverage&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) decline to offer such coverage to, or deny enrollment of, such individual; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) impose any preexisting condition exclusion (as defined in section 300gg(b)(1)(A) of this title) with respect to such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substitution by State of acceptable alternative mechanism</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirement of paragraph (1) shall not apply to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in a State in which the State is implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism under section 300gg&ndash;44 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Eligible individual&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this part, the term &ldquo;eligible individual&rdquo; means an individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) for whom, as of the date on which the individual seeks coverage under this section, the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage (as defined in section 300gg(c) of this title) is 18 or more months and (B) whose most recent prior creditable coverage was under a group health plan, governmental plan, or church plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with any such plan);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) who is not eligible for coverage under (A) a group health plan, (B) part A or part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq., 1395j et seq.], or (C) a State plan under title XIX of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] (or any successor program), and does not have other health insurance coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) with respect to whom the most recent coverage within the coverage period described in paragraph (1)(A) was not terminated based on a factor described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 300gg&ndash;12(b) of this title (relating to nonpayment of premiums or fraud);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the individual had been offered the option of continuation coverage under a COBRA continuation provision or under a similar State program, who elected such coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) who, if the individual elected such continuation coverage, has exhausted such continuation coverage under such provision or program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Alternative coverage permitted where no State mechanism</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in a State in which the State is not implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism under section 300gg&ndash;44 of this title, the health insurance issuer may elect to limit the coverage offered under subsection (a) of this section so long as it offers at least two different policy forms of health insurance coverage both of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are designed for, made generally available to, and actively marketed to, and enroll both eligible and other individuals by the issuer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) meet the requirement of paragraph (2) or (3), as elected by the issuer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this subsection, policy forms which have different cost-sharing arrangements or different riders shall be considered to be different policy forms.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Choice of most popular policy forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirement of this paragraph is met, for health insurance coverage policy forms offered by an issuer in the individual market, if the issuer offers the policy forms for individual health insurance coverage with the largest, and next to largest, premium volume of all such policy forms offered by the issuer in the State or applicable marketing or service area (as may be prescribed in regulation) by <!-- PDFPage:1194 -->the issuer in the individual market in the period involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Choice of 2 policy forms with representative coverage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirement of this paragraph is met, for health insurance coverage policy forms offered by an issuer in the individual market, if the issuer offers a lower-level coverage policy form (as defined in subparagraph (B)) and a higher-level coverage policy form (as defined in subparagraph (C)) each of which includes benefits substantially similar to other individual health insurance coverage offered by the issuer in that State and each of which is covered under a method described in section 300gg&ndash;44(c)(3)(A) of this title (relating to risk adjustment, risk spreading, or financial subsidization).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Lower-level of coverage described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A policy form is described in this subparagraph if the actuarial value of the benefits under the coverage is at least 85 percent but not greater than 100 percent of a weighted average (described in subparagraph (D)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Higher-level of coverage described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A policy form is described in this subparagraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the actuarial value of the benefits under the coverage is at least 15 percent greater than the actuarial value of the coverage described in subparagraph (B) offered by the issuer in the area involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the actuarial value of the benefits under the coverage is at least 100 percent but not greater than 120 percent of a weighted average (described in subparagraph (D)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Weighted average</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the weighted average described in this subparagraph is the average actuarial value of the benefits provided by all the health insurance coverage issued (as elected by the issuer) either by that issuer or by all issuers in the State in the individual market during the previous year (not including coverage issued under this section), weighted by enrollment for the different coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The issuer elections under this subsection shall apply uniformly to all eligible individuals in the State for that issuer. Such an election shall be effective for policies offered during a period of not shorter than 2 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (3), the actuarial value of benefits provided under individual health insurance coverage shall be calculated based on a standardized population and a set of standardized utilization and cost factors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules for network plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual market through a network plan, the issuer may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) limit the individuals who may be enrolled under such coverage to those who live, reside, or work within the service area for such network plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) within the service area of such plan, deny such coverage to such individuals if the issuer has demonstrated, if required, to the applicable State authority that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to additional individual enrollees because of its obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees and individual enrollees, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it is applying this paragraph uniformly to individuals without regard to any health status-related factor of such individuals and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 180-day suspension upon denial of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer, upon denying health insurance coverage in any service area in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), may not offer coverage in the individual market within such service area for a period of 180 days after such coverage is denied.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-41_1_target" name="300gg-41_1">1</a></sup> Application of financial capacity limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A health insurance issuer may deny health insurance coverage in the individual market to an eligible individual if the issuer has demonstrated, if required, to the applicable State authority that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it does not have the financial reserves necessary to underwrite additional coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is applying this paragraph uniformly to all individuals in the individual market in the State consistent with applicable State law and without regard to any health status-related factor of such individuals and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 180-day suspension upon denial of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer upon denying individual health insurance coverage in any service area in accordance with paragraph (1) may not offer such coverage in the individual market within such service area for a period of 180 days after the date such coverage is denied or until the issuer has demonstrated, if required under applicable State law, to the applicable State authority that the issuer has sufficient financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage, whichever is later. A State may provide for the application of this paragraph on a service-area-specific basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-41_1_target" name="300gg-41_1">1</a></sup> Market requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not be construed to require that a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage only in connection with group health plans or through one or more bona fide associations, or both, offer such health insurance coverage in the individual market.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1195 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Conversion policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with group health plans under this subchapter shall not be deemed to be a health insurance issuer offering individual health insurance coverage solely because such issuer offers a conversion policy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to restrict the amount of the premium rates that an issuer may charge an individual for health insurance coverage provided in the individual market under applicable State law; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to prevent a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in the individual market from establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and disease prevention.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A health insurance issuer may nonrenew or discontinue health insurance coverage of an individual in the individual market based only on one or more of the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonpayment of premiums</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Movement outside service area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the market through a network plan, the individual no longer resides, lives, or works in the service area (or in an area for which the issuer is authorized to do business) but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of covered individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Association membership ceases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of health insurance coverage that is made available in the individual market only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of the individual in the association (on the basis of which the coverage is provided) ceases but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of covered individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for uniform termination of coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Particular type of coverage not offered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which an issuer decides to discontinue offering a particular type of health insurance coverage offered in the individual market, coverage of such type may be discontinued by the issuer only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuer offers to each individual in the individual market provided coverage of this type, the option to purchase any other individual health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer for individuals in such market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in exercising the option to discontinue coverage of this type and in offering the option of coverage under subparagraph (B), the issuer acts uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of enrolled individuals or individuals who may become eligible for such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Discontinuance of all coverage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (C), in any case in which a health insurance issuer elects to discontinue offering all health insurance coverage in the individual market in a State, health insurance coverage may be discontinued by the issuer only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) An amount equal to 30 percent of such appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be allotted among qualifying States that apply for such a grant so that the amount allotted to such a State bears the same ratio to such appropriated amount as the number of uninsured individuals in the State bears to the total number of uninsured individuals (as determined by the Secretary) in all qualifying States that so apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) An amount equal to 30 percent of such appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be allotted among qualifying States that apply for such a grant so that the amount allotted to a State bears the same ratio to such appropriated amount as the number of individuals enrolled in health care coverage through the qualified high risk pool of the State bears to the total number of individuals so enrolled through qualified high risk pools (as determined by the Secretary) in all qualifying States that so apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for pools charging higher premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a qualified high risk pool of a State which charges premiums that exceed 150 percent of the premium for applicable standard risks, the State shall use at least 50 percent of the amount of the grant provided to the State to carry out this subsection to reduce premiums for enrollees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation for territories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In no case shall the aggregate amount allotted and made available under paragraph (2) for a fiscal year to States that are not the 50 States or the District of Columbia exceed $1,000,000.</p>
