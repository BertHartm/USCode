<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability; time period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits under a State plan approved under this part for an individual who is an alien described in clause (B) of section 602(a)(33) of this title, the income and resources of any person who (as a sponsor of such individual's entry into the United States) executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement with respect to such individual, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse, shall be deemed to be the unearned income and resources of such individual (in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this section) for a period of three years after the individual's entry into the United States, except that this section is not applicable if such individual is a dependent child and such sponsor (or such sponsor's spouse) is the parent of such child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of income of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the unearned income of an alien for any month shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount of earned and unearned income of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined for such month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the lesser of (I) 20 percent of the total of any amounts received by the sponsor and his spouse in such month as wages or salary or as net earnings from self-employment, plus the full amount of any costs incurred by them in producing self-employment income in such month, or (II) $175;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the cash needs standard established by the State under its plan for a family of the same size and composition as the sponsor and those other individuals living in the same household as the sponsor who are claimed by him as dependents for purposes of determining his Federal personal income tax liability but whose needs are not taken <!-- PDFPage:1225 -->into account in making a determination under section 602(a)(7) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any amounts paid by the sponsor (or his spouse) to individuals not living in such household who are claimed by him as dependents for purposes of determining his Federal personal income tax liability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) any payments of alimony or child support with respect to individuals not living in such household.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of resources of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the resources of an alien for any month shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount of the resources (determined as if the sponsor were applying for aid under the State plan approved under this part) of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by $1,500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision of information by alien concerning his sponsor; receipt of information from Departments of State and Justice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any individual who is an alien and whose sponsor was a public or private agency shall be ineligible for aid under a State plan approved under this part during the period of three years after his or her entry into the United States, unless the State agency administering such plan determines that such sponsor either no longer exists or has become unable to meet such individual's needs; and such determination shall be made by the State agency based upon such criteria as it may specify in the State plan, and upon such documentary evidence as it may therein require. Any such individual, and any other individual who is an alien (as a condition of his or her eligibility for aid under a State plan approved under this part during the period of three years after his or her entry into the United States), shall be required to provide to the State agency administering such plan such information and documentation with respect to his sponsor as may be necessary in order for the State agency to make any determination required under this section, and to obtain any cooperation from such sponsor necessary for any such determination. Such alien shall also be required to provide to the State agency such information and documentation as it may request and which such alien or his sponsor provided in support of such alien's immigration application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall enter into agreements with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General whereby any information available to them and required in order to make any determination under this section will be provided by them to the Secretary (who may, in turn, make such information available, upon request, to a concerned State agency), and whereby the Secretary of State and Attorney General will inform any sponsor of an alien, at the time such sponsor executes an affidavit of support or similar agreement, of the requirements imposed by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Joint and several liability of alien and sponsor for overpayment of aid during specified period following entry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any sponsor of an alien, and such alien, shall be jointly and severally liable for an amount equal to any overpayment of aid under the State plan made to such alien during the period of three years after such alien's entry into the United States, on account of such sponsor's failure to provide correct information under the provisions of this section, except where such sponsor was without fault, or where good cause of such failure existed. Any such overpayment which is not repaid to the State or recovered in accordance with the procedures generally applicable under the State plan to the recoupment of overpayments shall be withheld from any subsequent payment to which such alien or such sponsor is entitled under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Division of income and resources of individual sponsoring two or more aliens living in same home</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case where a person is the sponsor of two or more alien individuals who are living in the same home, the income and resources of such sponsor (and his spouse), to the extent they would be deemed the income and resources of any one of such individuals under the preceding provisions of this section, shall be divided into two or more equal shares (the number of shares being the same as the number of such alien individuals) and the income and resources of each such individual shall be deemed to include one such share.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Income and resources of a sponsor (and his spouse) which are deemed under this section to be the income and resources of any alien individual in a family shall not be considered in determining the need of other family members except to the extent such income or resources are actually available to such other members.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Aliens not covered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply with respect to any alien who is&mdash;</p>
