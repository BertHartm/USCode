<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of failure to apply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State or territory fails to apply for, or fails to give notice to the Corporation of its intent to apply for, an allotment under this section, or the Corporation does not approve the application consistent with section 12585 of this title, the Corporation may use the amount that would have been allotted under this section to the State or territory to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">From amounts appropriated for a fiscal year to provide financial assistance under the national service laws, the Corporation may provide assistance in the form of fixed-amount grants in an amount determined by the Corporation under paragraph (2) rather than on the basis of actual costs incurred by a program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Other than fixed-amount grants to support programs described in section 12581a of this title, for the 1-year period beginning on the effective date of the Serve America Act, the Corporation may provide assistance in the form of fixed-amount grants to programs that only offer full-time positions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of amount of fixed-amount grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A fixed-amount grant authorized by this subsection shall be in an amount determined by the Corporation that is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the proposed design of the program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) whether the program provides service to, or involves the participation of, disadvantaged youth or otherwise would reasonably incur a relatively higher level of costs; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Requirements for grant recipients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In awarding a fixed-amount grant under this subsection, the Corporation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall require the grant recipient&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to return a pro rata amount of the grant funds based upon the difference between the number of hours served by a participant and the minimum number of hours for completion of a term of service (as established by the Corporation);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to report on the program's performance on standardized measures and performance levels established by the Corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to cooperate with any evaluation activities undertaken by the Corporation; and</p>
