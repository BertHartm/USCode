<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) there is growing mutual economic interdependence among the countries of the Western Hemisphere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) energy and environmental issues are intrinsically linked and must be considered together when formulating policy on the broader issue of sustainable economic development for the Western Hemisphere as a whole;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) when developing their respective energy infrastructures, countries in the Western Hemisphere must consider existing and emerging environmental constraints, and do so in a way that results in sustainable long-term economic growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the coordination of respective national energy and environmental policies of the governments of the Western Hemisphere could be substantially improved through regular consultation among these countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the development, production and consumption of energy can affect environmental quality, and the environmental consequences of energy-related activities are not confined within national boundaries, but are regional and global in scope;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) although the Western Hemisphere is richly endowed with indigenous energy resources, an insufficient energy supply would severely constrain future opportunities for sustainable economic development and growth in each of these member countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the energy markets of the United States are linked with those in other countries of the Western Hemisphere and the world.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; means the Consultative Commission on Western Hemisphere Energy and Environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Negotiations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to direct the United States representative to the Organization of American States to initiate negotiations with the Organization of American States for the establishment of a Consultative Commission <!-- PDFPage:5486 -->on Western Hemisphere Energy and Environment under the auspices of the Organization of American States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) The Commission</h4>
