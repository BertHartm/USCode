<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any action brought pursuant to section 1983 of this title by an adult convicted of a crime confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, the court shall, if the court believes that such a requirement would be appropriate and in the interests of justice, continue such case for a period of not to exceed 180 days in order to require exhaustion of such plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies as are available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The exhaustion of administrative remedies under paragraph (1) may not be required unless the Attorney General has certified or the court has determined that such administrative remedies are in substantial compliance with the minimum acceptable standards promulgated under subsection (b) of this section or are otherwise fair and effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum standards for development and implementation of system for resolution of grievances of confined adults; consultation, promulgation, submission, etc., by Attorney General of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No later than one hundred eighty days after May 23, 1980, the Attorney General shall, after consultation with persons, State and local agencies, and organizations with background and expertise in the area of corrections, promulgate minimum standards for the development and implementation of a plain, speedy, and effective system for the resolution of grievances of adults confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility. The Attorney General shall submit such proposed standards for publication in the Federal Register in accordance with section 553 of title 5. Such standards shall take effect thirty legislative days after publication unless, within such period, either House of Congress adopts a resolution of disapproval of such standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The minimum standards shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for an advisory role for employees and inmates of any jail, prison, or other correctional institution (at the most decentralized level as is reasonably possible), in the formulation, implementation, and operation of the system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) specific maximum time limits for written replies to grievances with reasons thereto at each decision level within the system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for priority processing of grievances which are of an emergency nature, including matters in which delay would subject the grievant to substantial risk of personal injury or other damages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) for safeguards to avoid reprisals against any grievant or participant in the resolution of a grievance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) for independent review of the disposition of grievances, including alleged reprisals, by a person or other entity not under the direct supervision or direct control of the institution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedure for review and certification of systems for resolution of grievances of confined adults for determination of compliance with minimum standards; suspension or withdrawal of certification for noncompliance; development, etc., by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall develop a procedure for the prompt review and certification of systems for the resolution of grievances of adults confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, or pretrial detention facility, to determine if such systems, as voluntarily submitted by the various States and political subdivisions, are in substantial compliance with the minimum standards promulgated under subsection (b) of this section or are otherwise fair and effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Attorney General may suspend or withdraw the certification under paragraph (1) at any time that he has reasonable cause to believe that the grievance procedure is no longer in substantial compliance with the minimum standards promulgated under subsection (b) of this section or is no longer fair and effective.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Failure of State to adopt or adhere to administrative grievance procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of a State to adopt or adhere to an administrative grievance procedure consistent with this section shall not constitute the basis for an action under section 1997a or 1997c of this title.</p>
