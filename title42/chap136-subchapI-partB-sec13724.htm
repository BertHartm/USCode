<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Study of suitable bases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General shall jointly conduct a study of all military installations selected before September 13, 1994, to be closed pursuant to a base closure law for the purpose of evaluating the suitability of any of these installations, or portions of these installations, for conversion into Federal prison facilities. As part of the study, the Secretary and the Attorney General shall identify the military installations so evaluated that are most suitable for conversion into Federal prison facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suitability for conversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In evaluating the suitability of a military installation for conversion into a Federal prison facility, the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General shall consider the estimated cost to convert the installation into a prison facility and such other factors as the Secretary and the Attorney General consider to be appropriate.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6413 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Time for study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The study required by subsection (a) of this section shall be completed not later than the date that is 180 days after September 13, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Construction of Federal prisons</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining where to locate any new Federal prison facility, and in accordance with the Department of Justice's duty to review and identify a use for any portion of an installation closed pursuant to title II of the Defense Authorization Amendments and Base Closure and Realignment Act (Public Law 100&ndash;526) and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (part A of title XXIX of Public Law 101&ndash;510), the Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider whether using any portion of a military installation closed or scheduled to be closed in the region pursuant to a base closure law provides a cost-effective alternative to the purchase of real property or construction of new prison facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consider whether such use is consistent with a reutilization and redevelopment plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) give consideration to any installation located in a rural area the closure of which will have a substantial adverse impact on the economy of the local communities and on the ability of the communities to sustain an economic recovery from such closure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With regard to paragraph (1)(B), consent must be obtained from the local re-use authority for the military installation, recognized and funded by the Secretary of Defense, before the Attorney General may proceed with plans for the design or construction of a prison at the installation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report on basis of decision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before proceeding with plans for the design or construction of a Federal prison, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report explaining the basis of the decision on where to locate the new prison facility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report on cost-effectiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General decides not to utilize any portion of a closed military installation or an installation scheduled to be closed for locating a prison, the report shall include an analysis of why installations in the region, the use of which as a prison would be consistent with a reutilization and redevelopment plan, does not provide a cost-effective alternative to the purchase of real property or construction of new prison facilities.</p>
