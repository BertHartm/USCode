<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) providing funding for the design and development of facilities from new sources within the Foundation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ways to enable and encourage entities proposing facilities projects to receive design and development funding from nongovernmental sources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Transmittal</h4>
