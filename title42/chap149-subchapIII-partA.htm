<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this section applies to all royalty in-kind accepted by the Secretary on or after August 8, 2005, under any Federal oil or gas lease or permit under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 192 of title 30;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 1353 of title 43; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any other Federal law governing leasing of Federal land for oil and gas development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All royalty accruing to the United States shall, on the demand of the Secretary, be paid in-kind. If the Secretary makes such a demand, the following provisions apply to the payment:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Satisfaction of royalty obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Delivery by, or on behalf of, the lessee of the royalty amount and quality due under the lease satisfies royalty obligation of the lessee for the amount delivered, except that transportation and processing reimbursements paid to, or deductions claimed by, the lessee shall be subject to review and audit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Marketable condition</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Definition of marketable condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;in marketable condition&rdquo; means sufficiently free from impurities and otherwise in a condition that the royalty production will be accepted by a purchaser under a sales contract typical of the field or area in which the royalty production was produced.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Royalty production shall be placed in marketable condition by the lessee at no cost to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Disposition by the Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sell or otherwise dispose of any royalty production taken in-kind (other than oil or gas transferred under section 1353(a)(3) of title 43&nbsp;<sup><a href="#15902_1_target" name="15902_1">1</a></sup> for not less than the market price; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) transport or process (or both) any royalty production taken in-kind.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Retention by the Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may, notwithstanding section 3302 of title 31, retain and use a portion of the revenues from the sale of oil and gas taken in-kind that otherwise would be deposited to miscellaneous receipts, without regard to fiscal year limitation, or may use oil or gas received <!-- PDFPage:6988 -->as royalty taken in-kind (referred to in this paragraph as &ldquo;royalty production&rdquo;) to pay the cost of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) transporting the royalty production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) processing the royalty production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) disposing of the royalty production; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any combination of transporting, processing, and disposing of the royalty production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the Secretary may not use revenues from the sale of oil and gas taken in-kind to pay for personnel, travel, or other administrative costs of the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the Secretary may use a portion of the revenues from royalty in-kind sales, without fiscal year limitation, to pay salaries and other administrative costs directly related to the royalty in-kind program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reimbursement of cost</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the lessee, pursuant to an agreement with the United States or as provided in the lease, processes the royalty gas or delivers the royalty oil or gas at a point not on or adjacent to the lease area, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reimburse the lessee for the reasonable costs of transportation (not including gathering) from the lease to the point of delivery or for processing costs; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) allow the lessee to deduct the transportation or processing costs in reporting and paying royalties in-value for other Federal oil and gas leases.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Benefit to the United States required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may receive oil or gas royalties in-kind only if the Secretary determines that receiving royalties in-kind provides benefits to the United States that are greater than or equal to the benefits that are likely to have been received had royalties been taken in-value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reports</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than September 30, 2006, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that addresses&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) future royalty-in-kind businesses operation plans and objectives.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reports on oil or gas royalties taken in-kind</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each of fiscal years 2006 through 2015 in which the United States takes oil or gas royalties in-kind from production in any State or from the outer Continental Shelf, excluding royalties taken in-kind and sold to refineries under subsection (h), the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that describes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the 1 or more methodologies used by the Secretary to determine compliance with subsection (d), including the performance standard for comparing amounts received by the United States derived from royalties in-kind to amounts likely to have been received had royalties been taken in-value;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an explanation of the evaluation that led the Secretary to take royalties in-kind from a lease or group of leases, including the expected revenue effect of taking royalties in-kind;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) actual amounts received by the United States derived from taking royalties in-kind and costs and savings incurred by the United States associated with taking royalties in-kind, including administrative savings and any new or increased administrative costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) an evaluation of other relevant public benefits or detriments associated with taking royalties in-kind.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Deduction of expenses</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before making payments under section 191 of title 30 or section 1337(g) of title 43 of revenues derived from the sale of royalty production taken in-kind from a lease, the Secretary shall deduct amounts paid or deducted under subsections (b)(4) and (c) and deposit the amount of the deductions in the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Accounting for deductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When the Secretary allows the lessee to deduct transportation or processing costs under subsection (c), the Secretary may not reduce any payments to recipients of revenues derived from any other Federal oil and gas lease as a consequence of that deduction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Consultation with States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall consult with a State before conducting a royalty in-kind program under this part within the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may delegate management of any portion of the Federal royalty in-kind program to the State except as otherwise prohibited by Federal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall consult annually with any State from which Federal oil or gas royalty is being taken in-kind to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the royalty in-kind program provides revenues to the State greater than or equal to the revenues likely to have been received had royalties been taken in-value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Small refineries</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Preference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that sufficient supplies of crude oil are not available in the open market to refineries that do not have their own source of supply for crude oil, the Secretary may grant preference to those refineries in the sale of any royalty oil accruing or reserved to the United States under Federal oil and gas leases issued under any mineral leasing law, for processing or use in those refineries at private sale at not less than the market price.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6989 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Proration among refineries in production area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In disposing of oil under this subsection, the Secretary may, at the discretion of the Secretary, prorate the oil among refineries described in paragraph (1) in the area in which the oil is produced.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Disposition to Federal agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Onshore royalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any royalty oil or gas taken by the Secretary in-kind from onshore oil and gas leases may be sold at not less than the market price to any Federal agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Offshore royalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any royalty oil or gas taken in-kind from a Federal oil or gas lease on the outer Continental Shelf may be disposed of only under section 1353 of title 43.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Preference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In disposing of royalty oil or gas taken in-kind under this section, the Secretary may grant a preference to any person, including any Federal or State agency, for the purpose of providing additional resources to any Federal low-income energy assistance program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 3 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall submit a report to Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assessing the effectiveness of granting preferences specified in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) providing a specific recommendation on the continuation of authority to grant preferences.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A royalty rate prescribed in subsection (c)(1) shall terminate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with respect to oil production from a marginal property, on the first day of the production month following the date on which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the property no longer qualifies as a marginal property; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with respect to gas production from a marginal property, on the first day of the production month following the date on which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the property no longer qualifies as a marginal property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations prescribing different relief</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Discretionary regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may by regulation prescribe different parameters, standards, and require<!-- PDFPage:6990 -->ments for, and a different degree or extent of, royalty relief for marginal properties in lieu of those prescribed in subsections (a) through (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mandatory regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless a determination is made under paragraph (3), not later than 18 months after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall by regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prescribe standards and requirements for, and the extent of royalty relief for, marginal properties for oil and gas leases on the outer Continental Shelf; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) define what constitutes a marginal property on the outer Continental Shelf for purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent the Secretary determines that it is not practicable to issue the regulations referred to in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall provide a report to Congress explaining such determination by not later than 18 months after August 8, 2005.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Royalty incentive regulations for ultra deep gas wells</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, in addition to any other regulations that may provide royalty incentives for natural gas produced from deep wells on oil and gas leases issued pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), the Secretary shall issue regulations granting royalty relief suspension volumes of not less than 35 billion cubic feet with respect to the production of natural gas from ultra deep wells on leases issued in shallow waters less than 400 meters deep located in the Gulf of Mexico wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes west longitude. Regulations issued under this subsection shall be retroactive to the date that the notice of proposed rulemaking is published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Suspension volumes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may grant suspension volumes of not less than 35 billion cubic feet in any case in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the ultra deep well is a sidetrack; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the lease has previously produced from wells with a perforated interval the top of which is at least 15,000 feet true vertical depth below the datum at mean sea level.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Ultra deep well</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;ultra deep well&rdquo; means a well drilled with a perforated interval, the top of which is at least 20,000 true vertical depth below the datum at mean sea level.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) drilling a well from a platform slot reclaimed from a previously drilled well;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) re-entering and deepening a previously drilled well; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) a bypass from a sidetrack, including drilling around material blocking a hole or drilling to straighten a crooked hole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Royalty incentive regulations for deep gas wells</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, in addition to any other regulations that may provide royalty incentives for natural gas produced from deep wells on oil and gas leases issued pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act (43 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), the Secretary shall issue regulations granting royalty relief suspension volumes with respect to production of natural gas from deep wells on leases issued in waters more than 200 meters but less than 400 meters deep located in the Gulf of Mexico wholly west of 87 degrees, 30 minutes west longitude. The suspension volumes for deep wells within 200 to 400 meters of water depth shall be calculated using the same methodology used to calculate the suspension volumes for deep wells in the shallower waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and in no case shall the suspension volumes for deep wells within 200 to 400 meters of water depth be lower than those for deep wells in shallower waters. Regulations issued under this subsection shall be retroactive to the date that the notice of proposed rulemaking is published in the Federal Register.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;15910. Enhanced oil and natural gas production through carbon dioxide injection</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Production incentive</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Approximately two-thirds of the original oil in place in the United States remains unproduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Enhanced oil and natural gas production from the sequestering of carbon dioxide and other appropriate gases has the potential to increase oil and natural gas production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Capturing and productively using carbon dioxide would help reduce the carbon intensity of the economy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to promote the capturing, transportation, and injection of produced carbon dioxide, natural carbon dioxide, and other appropriate gases or other matter for sequestration into oil and gas fields; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to promote oil and natural gas production from the outer Continental Shelf and onshore Federal lands under lease by providing royalty incentives to use enhanced recovery techniques using injection of the substances referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suspension of royalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that reduction of the royalty under a Federal oil and gas lease that is an eligible lease is in the public interest and promotes the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall undertake a rulemaking to provide for such reduction for an eligible lease.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rulemakings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall publish the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking within 180 days after August 8, 2005, and complete the rulemaking implementing this section within 365 days after August 8, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Eligible leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A lease shall be an eligible lease for purposes of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it is a lease for production of oil and gas from the outer Continental Shelf or Federal onshore lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the injection of the substances referred to in subsection (a)(2)(A) will be used as an enhanced recovery technique on such lease; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Secretary determines that the lease contains oil or gas that would not likely be produced without the royalty reduction provided under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Amount of relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rulemaking shall provide for a suspension volume, which shall not exceed 5,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent for each eligible lease. Such suspension volume shall be applied to any production from an eligible lease occurring on or after the date of publication of any advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may place limitations on the royalty reduction granted under this section based on market price.</p>
