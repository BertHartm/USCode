<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Proportionality of allotment; minimum allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From the sums appropriated under section 10409 of this title and available for grants to States under this subsection for any fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be allotted not less than 1/8 of 1 percent of the amounts available for grants under section 10402(a) of this title for the fiscal year for which the allotment is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) each State shall be allotted for payment in a grant authorized under section 10402(a) of this title, $600,000, with the remaining funds to be allotted to each State in an amount that bears the same ratio to such remaining funds as the population of such State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of population of States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of this section, the population of each State, and the total population of all the States, shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most recent census data available to the Secretary, and the Secretary shall use for such purpose, if available, the annual interim current census data produced by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant to section 181 of title 13.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Ratable reduction of amounts; increase on availability of additional funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the sums appropriated under section 10409 of this title for any fiscal year and available for grants to States authorized under section 10402(a) of this title are not sufficient to pay in full the total amounts which all States are entitled to receive under such section for such fiscal year, then the maximum amounts which all States are entitled to receive under such section for such fiscal year shall be ratably reduced. In the event that additional funds become available for making such grants for any fiscal year during which the preceding sentence is applicable, such reduced amounts shall be increased on the same basis as they were reduced.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallotment; continued availability of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, at the end of the sixth month of any fiscal year for which sums are appropriated under section 10409 of this title, the amount allotted to a State has not been made available to such State in grants under section 10402(a) of this title because of the failure of such State to meet the requirements for a grant, then the Secretary shall reallot such amount to States which meet such requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds made available by the Secretary through reallotment under paragraph (1) shall remain available for expenditure until the end of the fiscal year following the fiscal year in which such funds become available for reallotment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exclusion from definition of &ldquo;State&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In subsection (a)(2) of this section, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not include any jurisdiction specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
