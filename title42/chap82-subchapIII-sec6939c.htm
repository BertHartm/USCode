<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply with respect to any facility subject to any permit establishing a schedule for treatment of such wastes, or any existing agreement or administrative or <!-- PDFPage:4492 -->judicial order governing the treatment of such wastes, to which the State is a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Each plan shall contain the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For mixed wastes for which treatment technologies exist, a schedule for submitting all applicable permit applications, entering into contracts, initiating construction, conducting systems testing, commencing operations, and processing backlogged and currently generated mixed wastes.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Waiver of plan requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A State may waive the requirement for the Secretary of Energy to develop and submit a plan under this subsection for a facility located in the State if the State (i) enters into an agreement with the Secretary of Energy that addresses compliance at that facility with section 6924(j) of this title with respect to mixed waste, and (ii) issues an order requiring compliance with such agreement and which is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any violation of an agreement or order referred to in subparagraph (A) is subject to the waiver of sovereign immunity contained in section 6961(a) of this title.</p>
