<p class="note-body"><b>2011</b>&mdash;Pub. L. 111&ndash;358 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, text read as follows: &ldquo;A fundamental and unique capability of NASA is in stimulating science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education in the United States. In ensuring maximum use of that capability, NASA shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) establish a program to annually sponsor scientific and educational payloads developed with United States student and educator involvement to be flown on commercially available orbital platforms, when available and operational, with the goal of launching at least 50 such payloads (with at least one from each of the 50 States) to orbit on at least one mission per year;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) contract with providers of commercial orbital platform services for their use by the STEM-Commercial Orbital Platform program, preceded by the issuance of a request for proposal, not later than 90 days after October 11, 2010, to enter into at least one funded, competitively-awarded contract for commercial orbital platform services and make awards within 180 days after such date; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) engage with United States students and educators and make available NASA's science, engineering, payload development, and payload operations expertise to student teams selected to participate in the STEM-Commercial Orbital Platform program.&rdquo;</p>
