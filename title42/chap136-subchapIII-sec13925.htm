<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title II, &sect;201, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 2993, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Nearly 1/3 of American women report physical or sexual abuse by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 248,000 Americans 12 years of age and older were raped or sexually assaulted in 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Rape and sexual assault in the United States is estimated to cost $127,000,000,000 per year, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) lost productivity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) medical and mental health care;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) police and fire services;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) social services;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) loss of and damage to property; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) reduced quality of life.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Nonreporting of sexual assault in rural areas is a particular problem because of the high rate of nonstranger sexual assault.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Geographic isolation often compounds the problems facing sexual assault victims. The lack of anonymity and accessible support services can limit opportunities for justice for victims.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Domestic elder abuse is primarily family abuse. The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study found that the perpetrator was a family member in 90 percent of cases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Barriers for older victims leaving abusive relationships include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the inability to support themselves;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) poor health that increases their dependence on the abuser;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) fear of being placed in a nursing home; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) ineffective responses by domestic abuse programs and law enforcement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Disabled women comprise another vulnerable population with unmet needs. Women with disabilities are more likely to be the victims of abuse and violence than women without disabilities because of their increased physical, economic, social, or psychological dependence on others.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Many women with disabilities also fail to report the abuse, since they are dependent on their abusers and fear being abandoned or institutionalized.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Of the 598 battered women's programs surveyed&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) only 35 percent of these programs offered disability awareness training for their staff; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) only 16 percent dedicated a staff member to provide services to women with disabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of their family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to file immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and children as powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant women from seeking help, trapping battered immigrant women in violent homes because of fear of deportation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee abusive relationships may not have access to bilingual shelters or bilingual professionals, and face restrictions on public or financial assistance. They may also lack assistance of a certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to the police or a 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 operator, or even in acquiring information about their rights and the legal system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, the National Domestic Violence Hotline provides crisis intervention and immediately connects callers with sources of help in their local community.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a domestic violence situation and that they have not called the police or any other support services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase in call volume at the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Improving technology infrastructure at the National Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly and effectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title III, &sect;301, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3003, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Youth, under the age of 18, account for 67 percent of all sexual assault victimizations reported to law enforcement officials.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Department of Justice consistently finds that young women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the highest rate of non-fatal intimate partner violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In 1 year, over 4,000 incidents of rape or sexual assault occurred in public schools across the country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Young people experience particular obstacles to seeking help. They often do not have access to money, transportation, or shelter services. They must overcome issues such as distrust of adults, lack of knowledge about available resources, or pressure from peers and parents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A needs assessment on teen relationship abuse for the State of California, funded by the California Department of Health Services, identified a desire for confidentiality and confusion about the law as 2 of the most significant barriers to young victims of domestic and dating violence seeking help.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Only one State specifically allows for minors to petition the court for protection orders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Many youth are involved in dating relationships, and these relationships can include the same kind of domestic violence and dating violence seen in the adult population. In fact, more than 40 percent of all incidents of domestic violence involve people who are not married.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend, and 13 percent of college women report being stalked.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Of college women who said they had been the victims of rape or attempted rape, 12.8 percent of completed rapes, 35 percent of attempted rapes, and 22.9 percent of threatened rapes took place on a date. Almost 60 percent of the completed rapes that occurred on campus took place in the victim's residence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) According to a 3-year study of student-athletes at 10 Division I universities, male athletes made up only 3.3 percent of the general male university <!-- PDFPage:6886 -->population, but they accounted for 19 percent of the students reported for sexual assault and 35 percent of domestic violence perpetrators.&rdquo;</p>
