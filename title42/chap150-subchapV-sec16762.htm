<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;161, div. B, title III, Dec. 26, 2007, 121 Stat. 1919, provided that: &ldquo;The Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall prepare a strategy for minimizing job losses when the National Aeronautics and Space Administration transitions from the Space Shuttle to a successor human-rated space transport vehicle.
