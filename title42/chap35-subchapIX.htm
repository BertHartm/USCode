<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to foster and promote useful part-time opportunities in community service activities for unemployed low-income persons who are 55 years or older and who have poor employment prospects, and in order to foster individual economic self-sufficiency and to increase the number of persons who may enjoy the benefits of unsubsidized employment in both the public and private sectors, the Secretary of Labor (hereafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) is authorized to establish an older American community service employment program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts appropriated to carry out this subchapter shall be used only to carry out the provisions contained in this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of Secretary; execution of agreements to further purposes and goals of program</h4>

Such agreements may include provisions for the payment of costs, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, of projects developed by such organizations and agencies in cooperation with the Secretary in order to make the program effective or to supplement the program.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if such project is carried out by a tribal organization that enters into an agreement under this subsection or receives assistance from a State that enters into such an agreement, will provide employment for such individuals, including those who are Indians residing on an Indian reservation, as the term is defined in section 3501(2) of title 25;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) will employ eligible individuals in service related to publicly owned and operated facilities and projects, or projects sponsored by organizations, other than political parties, exempt from taxation under the provisions of section 501(c)(3) of title 26, except projects involving the construction, operation, or maintenance of any facility used or to be used as a place for sectarian religious instruction or worship;</p>
