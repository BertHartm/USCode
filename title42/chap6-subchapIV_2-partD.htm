<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that such State will undertake&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom an assignment under section 602(a)(26) of this title or section 1396k of this title is effective, to establish the paternity of such child, unless the agency administering the plan of the State under part A of this subchapter determines in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to section 602(a)(26)(B) of this title that it is against the best interests of the child to do so, or, in the case of such a child with respect to whom an assignment under section 1396k of this title is in effect, the State agency administering the plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter determines pursuant to section 1396k(a)(1)(B) of this title that it is against the best interests of the child to do so, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any child with respect to whom such assignment is effective, including an assignment with respect to a child on whose behalf a State agency is making foster care maintenance payments under part E of this subchapter, to secure support for such child from his parent (or from any other person legally liable for such support), and from such parent for his spouse (or former spouse) receiving aid to families with dependent children or medical assistance under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter (but only if a support obligation has been established with respect to such spouse, and only if the support obligation established with respect to the child is being enforced under the plan), utilizing any reciprocal arrangements adopted with other States (unless the agency administering the plan of the State under part A or E of this subchapter determines in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to section 602(a)(26)(B) of this title that it is against the best interests of the child to do so), except that when such arrangements and other means have proven ineffective, the State may utilize the Federal courts to obtain or enforce court orders for support;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that (A) in any case in which support payments are collected for an individual with respect to whom an assignment under section 602(a)(26) of this title is effective, such payments shall be made to the State for distribution pursuant to section 657 of this title and shall not be paid directly to the family, and the individual will be notified on a monthly basis (or on a quarterly basis for so long as the Secretary determines with respect to a State that requiring such notice on a monthly basis would impose an unreasonable administrative burden) of the amount of the support payments collected;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#654_1_target" name="654_1">1</a></sup> except that this paragraph shall not apply to such payments for any month following the first month in which the amount collected is sufficient to make such family ineligible for assistance under the State plan approved under part A of this subchapter; and (B) in any case in which support payments are collected for an individual pursuant to the assignment made under section 1396k of this title, such payments shall be made to the State for distribution pursuant to section 1396k of this title, except that this clause shall not apply to such payments for any month after the month in which the individual ceases to be eligible for medical assistance;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) from the parent who owes the child or spousal support obligation involved, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at the option of the State, from the individual to whom such services are made available, but only if such State has in effect a procedure whereby all persons in such State having authority to order child or spousal support are informed that such costs are to be collected from the individual to whom such services were made available;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Parent Locator Service in the Department of Health and Human Services;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide that the State will, in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, cooperate with any other State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in establishing paternity, if necessary,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in securing compliance by an absent parent residing in such State (whether or not permanently) with an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction against such parent for the support and maintenance of the child or children or the parent of such child or children with respect to whom aid is being provided under the plan of such other State, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) maintain methods of administration which are designed to assure that persons responsible for handling cash receipts shall not participate in accounting or operating functions which would permit them to conceal in the accounting records the misuse of cash receipts (except that the Secretary shall by regulations provide for exceptions to this requirement in the case of sparsely populated areas where the hiring of unreasonable additional staff would otherwise be necessary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) provide, at the option of the State, for the establishment, in accordance with an (initial and annually updated) advance automated data processing planning document approved under section 652(d) of this title, of a statewide automated data processing and information retrieval system designed effectively and efficiently to assist management in the administration of the State plan, in the State and localities thereof, so as (A) to control, account for, and monitor (i) all the factors in the support enforcement collection and paternity determination process under such plan (including, but not limited to, (I) identifiable correlation factors (such as social security numbers, names, dates of birth, home addresses and mailing addresses (including postal ZIP codes) of any individual with respect to whom support obligations are sought to be established or enforced and with respect to any person to whom such support obligations are owing) to assure sufficient compatibility among the systems of different jurisdictions to permit periodic screening to determine whether such individual is paying or is obligated to pay support in more than one jurisdiction, (II) checking of records of such individuals on a periodic basis with Federal, intra- and inter-State, and local agencies, (III) maintaining the data necessary to meet the Federal reporting requirements on a timely basis, and (IV) delinquency and enforcement activities), (ii) the collection and distribution of support payments (both intra- and inter-State), the determination, collection, and distribution of incentive payments both inter- and intra-State, and the maintenance of accounts receivable on all amounts owed, collected and distributed, and (iii) the costs of all services rendered, either directly or by interfacing with State financial management and expenditure information, (B) to provide interface with records of the State's aid to families with dependent children program in order to determine if a collection of a support payment causes a change affecting eligibility for or the amount of aid under such program, (C) to provide for security against unauthorized access to, or use of, the data in such system, (D) to facilitate the development and improvement of the income withholding and other procedures required under section 666(a) of this title through the monitoring of support payments, the maintenance of accurate records regarding the payment of support, and <!-- PDFPage:1250 -->the prompt provision of notice to appropriate officials with respect to any arrearages in support payments which may occur, and (E) to provide management information on all cases under the State plan from initial referral or application through collection and enforcement;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; requirement; quarterly payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage and reward State child support enforcement programs which perform in a cost-effective and efficient manner to secure support for all children who have sought assistance in securing support, whether such children reside within the State or elsewhere and whether or not they are eligible for aid to families with dependent children under a State plan approved under part A of this subchapter, and regardless of the economic circumstances of their parents, the Secretary shall, from support collected which would otherwise represent the Federal share of assistance to families of absent parents, pay to each State for each fiscal year, on a quarterly basis (as described in subsection (e) of this section) beginning with the quarter commencing October 1, 1985, an incentive payment in an amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incentive formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the incentive payment shall be equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 6 percent of the total amount of support collected under the plan during the fiscal year in cases in which the support obligation involved is assigned to the State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) or section 671(a)(17) of this title (with such total amount for any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;AFDC collections&rdquo; for that year), plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 6 percent of the total amount of support collected during the fiscal year in all other cases under this part (with such total amount for any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;non-AFDC collections&rdquo; for that year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If subsection (c) of this section applies with respect to a State's AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections for any fiscal year, the percent specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (B) (with respect to such collections) shall be increased to the higher percent determined under such subsection (with respect to such collections) in determining the State's incentive payment under this subsection for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The dollar amount of the portion of the State's incentive payment for any fiscal year which is determined on the basis of its non-AFDC collections under paragraph (1)(B) (after adjustment under subsection (c) of this section if applicable) shall in no case exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the dollar amount of the portion of such payment which is determined on the basis of its AFDC collections under paragraph (1)(A) (after adjustment under subsection (c) of this section if applicable) in the case of fiscal year 1986 or 1987;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 105 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1988;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 110 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1989; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 115 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1990 or any fiscal year thereafter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall make such additional payments to the State under this part, for fiscal year 1986 or 1987, as may be necessary to assure that the total amount of payments under this section and section 655(a)(1)(A) of this title for such fiscal year is no less than 80 percent of the amount that would have been payable to that State and its political subdivisions for such fiscal year under this section and section 655(a)(1)(A) of this title if those sections (including the amendment made by section 5(c)(2)(A) of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984) had remained in effect as they were in effect for fiscal year 1985.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increase in percentage; laboratory costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the total amount of a State's AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections for any fiscal year bears a ratio to the total amount expended by the State in that year for the operation of its plan approved under section 654 of this title for which payment may be made under section 655 of this title (with the total amount so expended <!-- PDFPage:1259 -->in any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;combined AFDC/non-AFDC administrative costs&rdquo; for that year) which is equal to or greater than 1.4, the relevant percent specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section (with respect to such collections) shall be increased to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 6.5 percent, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) one-half of 1 percent for each full two-tenths by which such ratio exceeds 1.4;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the percent so specified shall in no event be increased (for either AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections) to more than 10 percent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity in any fiscal year may at the option of the State be excluded from the State's combined AFDC/non-AFDC administrative costs for that year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Support collected on behalf of individuals residing in another State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing incentive payments under this section, support which is collected by one State at the request of another State shall be treated as having been collected in full by each such State, and any amounts expended by the State in carrying out a special project assisted under section 655(e) of this title shall be excluded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Estimates by Secretary; quarterly payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amounts of the incentive payments to be made to the various States under this section for any fiscal year shall be estimated by the Secretary at or before the beginning of such year on the basis of the best information available. The Secretary shall make such payments for such year, on a quarterly basis (with each quarterly payment being made no later than the beginning of the quarter involved), in the amounts so estimated, reduced or increased to the extent of any overpayments or underpayments which the Secretary determines were made under this section to the States involved for prior periods and with respect to which adjustment has not already been made under this subsection. Upon the making of any estimate by the Secretary under the preceding sentence, any appropriations available for payments under this section shall be deemed obligated.</p>

<p class="note-body">(iii) changes needed for selecting Federal agencies to test and evaluate new approaches to the establishment and enforcement of child support obligations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) proposals to improve service of process for civilian employees and members of the Uniformed Services stationed outside the United States, including the possibility of serving process by certified mail in establishment and enforcement cases or of designating an agent for service of process that would have the same effect and bind employees to the same extent as actual service upon the employees;</p>

<p class="note-body">(vi) analysis of whether compliance with support orders should be a factor used in defining suitability for Federal employment.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;664. Collection of past-due support from Federal tax refunds</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procedures applicable; distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support which has been assigned to such State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) or section 671(a)(17) of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual). If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall withhold from such refunds an amount equal to the past-due support, shall concurrently send notice to such individual that the withholding has been made (including in or with such notice a notification to any other person who may have filed a joint return with such individual of the steps which such other person may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the refund), and shall pay such amount to the State agency (together with notice of the individual's home address) for distribution in accordance with section 657(b)(4) or (d)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support (as that term is defined for purposes of this paragraph under subsection (c) of this section) which such State has agreed to collect under section 654(6) of this title, and that the State agency has sent notice to such individual in accordance with paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual). If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall withhold from such refunds an amount equal to such past-due support, and shall concurrently send notice to such individual that the withholding has been made, including in or with such notice a notification to any other person who may have filed a joint return with such individual of the steps which such other person may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the refund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay the amount withheld to the State agency, and the State shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury any fee imposed by the Secretary of the Treasury to cover the costs of the withholding and any required notification. The State agency shall, subject to paragraph (3)(B), distribute such amount to or on behalf of the child to whom the support was owed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply only with respect to refunds payable under section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 after December 31, 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Prior to notifying the Secretary of the Treasury under paragraph (1) or (2) that an individual owes past-due support, the State shall send notice to such individual that a withholding will be made from any refund otherwise payable to such individual. The notice shall also (i) instruct the individual owing the past-due support of the steps which may be taken to contest the State's determination that past-due support is owed or the amount of the past-due support, and (ii) provide information, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by regulation in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, with respect to procedures to be followed, in the case of a joint return, to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to another person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that an amount should be withheld under paragraph (1) or (2), and that the refund from which it should be withheld is based upon a joint return, the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the State that the withholding is being made from a refund based upon a joint return, and shall furnish to the State the names and addresses of each taxpayer filing such joint return. In the case of a withholding under paragraph (2), the State may delay distribution of the amount withheld until the State has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that the other person filing the joint return has received his or her proper share of the refund, but such delay may not exceed six months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the other person filing the joint return with the named individual owing the past-due support takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of a refund from which a withholding was made under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay such share to such other person. The Secretary of the Treasury shall deduct the amount of such payment from amounts subsequently payable to the State agency to which the amount originally withheld from such refund was paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any case in which an amount was withheld under paragraph (1) or (2) and paid to a State, and the State subsequently determines that the amount certified as past-due support was in excess of the amount actually owed at the time the amount withheld is to be distributed to or on behalf of the child, the State shall pay the excess amount withheld to the named individual thought to have owed the past-due support (or, in the case of amounts withheld on the basis of a joint return, jointly to the parties filing such return).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations; contents, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations, approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, prescribing the time or times at which States must submit notices of past-due support, the manner in which such notices must be submitted, and the necessary information that must be contained in or accompany the notices. The regulations shall be consistent with the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section, shall specify the minimum amount of past-due support to which the offset procedure established by subsection (a) of this section may be applied, and the fee that a State must pay to reimburse the Secretary of the Treasury for the full cost of applying the offset procedure, and shall provide that the Secretary of the Treasury will advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services, not less frequently than annually, of the States which have furnished notices of past-due support under sub<!-- PDFPage:1267 -->section (a) of this section, the number of cases in each State with respect to which such notices have been furnished, the amount of support sought to be collected under this subsection by each State, and the amount of such collections actually made in the case of each State. Any fee paid to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection may be used to reimburse appropriations which bore all or part of the cost of applying such procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of withholdings made under subsection (a)(2) of this section, the regulations promulgated pursuant to this subsection shall include the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The withholding shall apply only in the case where the State determines that the amount of the past-due support which will be owed at the time the withholding is to be made, based upon the pattern of payment of support and other enforcement actions being pursued to collect the past-due support, is equal to or greater than $500. The State may limit the $500 threshold amount to amounts of past-due support accrued since the time that the State first began to enforce the child support order involved under the State plan, and may limit the application of the withholding to past-due support accrued since such time.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Mandatory allotment; notice upon failure to make; amount of allotment; adjustment or discontinuance; consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which child support payments or child and spousal support payments are owed by a member of one of the uniformed services (as defined in section 101(3) of title 37) on active duty, such member shall be required to make allotments from his pay and allowances <!-- PDFPage:1268 -->(under chapter 13 of title 37) as payment of such support, when he has failed to make periodic payments under a support order that meets the criteria specified in section 1673(b)(1)(A) of title 15 and the resulting delinquency in such payments is in a total amount equal to the support payable for two months or longer. Failure to make such payments shall be established by notice from an authorized person (as defined in subsection (b) of this section) to the designated official in the appropriate uniformed service. Such notice (which shall in turn be given to the affected member) shall also specify the person to whom the allotment is to be payable. The amount of the allotment shall be the amount necessary to comply with the order (which, if the order so provides, may include arrearages as well as amounts for current support), except that the amount of the allotment, together with any other amounts withheld for support from the wages of the member, as a percentage of his pay from the uniformed service, shall not exceed the limits prescribed in sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#665_1_target" name="665_1">1</a></sup> 1673(b) and (c) of title 15. An allotment under this subsection shall be adjusted or discontinued upon notice from the authorized person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, no action shall be taken to require an allotment from the pay and allowances of any member of one of the uniformed services under such provisions (A) until such member has had a consultation with a judge advocate of the service involved (as defined in section 801(13) of title 10), or with a law specialist (as defined in section 801(11) of such title) in the case of the Coast Guard, or with a legal officer designated by the Secretary concerned (as defined in section 101(5) of title 37) in any other case, in person, to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect to the member's support obligation and his failure to make payments thereon, or (B) until 30 days have elapsed after the notice described in the second sentence of paragraph (1) is given to the affected member in any case where it has not been possible, despite continuing good faith efforts, to arrange such a consultation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Authorized person&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section the term &ldquo;authorized person&rdquo; with respect to any member of the uniformed services means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any agent or attorney of a State having in effect a plan approved under this part who has the duty or authority under such plan to seek to recover any amounts owed by such member as child or child and spousal support (including, when authorized under the State plan, any official of a political subdivision); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the court which has authority to issue an order against such member for the support and maintenance of a child, or any agent of such court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Defense, in the case of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and the Secretary concerned (as defined in section 101(5) of title 37) in the case of each of the other uniformed services, shall each issue regulations applicable to allotments to be made under this section, designating the officials to whom notice of failure to make support payments, or notice to discontinue or adjust an allotment, should be given, prescribing the form and content of the notice and specifying any other rules necessary for such Secretary to implement this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;666. Requirement of statutorily prescribed procedures to improve effectiveness of child support enforcement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of procedures required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to satisfy section 654(20)(A) of this title, each State must have in effect laws requiring the use of the following procedures, consistent with this section and with regulations of the Secretary, to increase the effectiveness of the program which the State administers under this part:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Procedures described in subsection (b) of this section for the withholding from income of amounts payable as support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Procedures under which expedited processes (determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary) are in effect under the State judicial system or under State administrative processes (A) for obtaining and enforcing support orders, and (B) for establishing paternity. The Secretary may waive the provisions of this paragraph with respect to one or more political subdivisions within the State on the basis of the effectiveness and timeliness of support order issuance and enforcement or paternity establishment within the political subdivision (in accordance with the general rule for exemptions under subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Procedures under which the State child support enforcement agency shall request, and the State shall provide, that for the purpose of enforcing a support order under any State plan approved under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any refund of State income tax which would otherwise be payable to an absent parent will be reduced, after notice has been sent to that absent parent of the proposed reduction and the procedures to be followed to contest it (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State), by the amount of any overdue support owed by such absent parent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount by which such refund is reduced shall be distributed in accordance with section 657(b)(4) or (d)(3) of this title in the case of overdue support assigned to a State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) or 671(a)(17) of this title, or, in the case of overdue support which a State has agreed to collect under section 654(6) of this title, shall be distributed, after deduction of any fees imposed by the State to cover the costs of col<!-- PDFPage:1269 -->lection, to the child or parent to whom such support is owed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notice of the absent parent's social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) and home address shall be furnished to the State agency requesting the refund offset, and to the State agency enforcing the order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Procedures under which liens are imposed against real and personal property for amounts of overdue support owed by an absent parent who resides or owns property in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A)(i) Procedures which permit the establishment of the paternity of any child at any time prior to such child's eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) As of August 16, 1984, the requirement of clause (i) shall also apply to any child for whom paternity has not yet been established and any child for whom a paternity action was brought but dismissed because a statute of limitations of less than 18 years was then in effect in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures under which the State is required (except in cases where the individual involved has been found under section 602(a)(26)(B) of this title to have good cause for refusing to cooperate) to require the child and all other parties, in a contested paternity case, to submit to genetic tests upon the request of any such party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Procedures for a simple civil process for voluntarily acknowledging paternity under which the State must provide that the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging paternity are explained and ensure that due process safeguards are afforded. Such procedures must include a hospital-based program for the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity during the period immediately before or after the birth of a child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity creates a rebuttable, or at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity, and under which such voluntary acknowledgment is admissible as evidence of paternity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity must be recognized as a basis for seeking a support order without requiring any further proceedings to establish paternity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Procedures which provide that (i) any objection to genetic testing results must be made in writing within a specified number of days before any hearing at which such results may be introduced into evidence, and (ii) if no objection is made, the test results are admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Procedures which create a rebuttable or, at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity upon genetic testing results indicating a threshold probability that the alleged father is the father of the child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Procedures requiring a default order to be entered in a paternity case upon a showing of service of process on the defendent&nbsp;<sup><a href="#666_1_target" name="666_1">1</a></sup> and any additional showing required by State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Procedures which require that an absent parent give security, post a bond, or give some other guarantee to secure payment of overdue support, after notice has been sent to such absent parent of the proposed action and of the procedures to be followed to contest it (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Procedures which require the State to periodically report to consumer reporting agencies (as defined in section 1681a(f) of title 15) the name of any parent who owes overdue support and is at least 2 months delinquent in the payment of such support and the amount of such delinquency; except that (A) if the amount of the overdue support involved in any case is less than $1,000, information regarding such amount shall be made available only at the option of the State, (B) any information with respect to an absent parent shall be made available under such procedures only after notice has been sent to such absent parent of the proposed action, and such absent parent has been given a reasonable opportunity to contest the accuracy of such information (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State), and (C) such information shall not be made available to (i) a consumer reporting agency which the State determines does not have sufficient capability to systematically and timely make accurate use of such information, or (ii) an entity which has not furnished evidence satisfactory to the State that the entity is a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8)(A) Procedures under which all child support orders not described in subparagraph (B) will include provision for withholding from wages, in order to assure that withholding as a means of collecting child support is available if arrearages occur without the necessity of filing application for services under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures under which all child support orders which are initially issued in the State on or after January 1, 1994, and are not being enforced under this part will include the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The wages of an absent parent shall be subject to withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, on the effective date of the order; except that such wages shall not be subject to withholding under this clause in any case where (I) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court (or administrative process) finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or (II) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section (which shall apply in the case of each absent parent against whom a support order is or has been issued or modified in the State, without regard to whether the order is being enforced under the State plan).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (2), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), and (10) of subsection (b) of this section, where applicable.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1270 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Withholding from income of amounts payable as support must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Procedures which require that any payment or installment of support under any child support order, whether ordered through the State judicial system or through the expedited processes required by paragraph (2), is (on and after the date it is due)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of the State, including the ability to be enforced,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in such State and in any other State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not subject to retroactive modification by such State or by any other State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that such procedures may permit modification with respect to any period during which there is pending a petition for modification, but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee or (where the obligee is the petitioner) to the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10)(A) Procedures to ensure that, beginning 2 years after October 13, 1988, if the State determines (pursuant to a plan indicating how and when child support orders in effect in the State are to be periodically reviewed and adjusted) that a child support order being enforced under this part should be reviewed, the State must, at the request of either parent subject to the order, or of a State child support enforcement agency, initiate a review of such order, and adjust such order, as appropriate, in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to section 667(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures to ensure that, beginning 5 years after October 13, 1988, or such earlier date as the State may select, the State must implement a process for the periodic review and adjustment of child support orders being enforced under this part under which the order is to be reviewed not later than 36 months after the establishment of the order or the most recent review, and adjusted, as appropriate, in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to section 667(a) of this title, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of an order with respect to an individual with respect to whom an assignment under section 602(a)(26) of this title is in effect, the State has determined, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, that such a review would not be in the best interests of the child and neither parent has requested review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of any other order being enforced under this part, neither parent has requested review.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Procedures to ensure that the State notifies each parent subject to a child support order in effect in the State that is being enforced under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) of any review of such order, at least 30 days before the commencement of such review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) of the right of such parent under subparagraph (B) to request the State to review such order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) of a proposed adjustment (or determination that there should be no change) in the child support award amount, and such parent is afforded not less than 30 days after such notification to initiate proceedings to challenge such adjustment (or determination).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Procedures under which a State must give full faith and credit to a determination of paternity made by any other State, whether established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative or judicial processes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding section 654(20)(B) of this title, the procedures which are required under paragraphs (3), (4), (6), and (7) need not be used or applied in cases where the State determines (using guidelines which are generally available within the State and which take into account the payment record of the absent parent, the availability of other remedies, and other relevant considerations) that such use or application would not carry out the purposes of this part or would be otherwise inappropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Withholding from income of amounts payable as support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procedures referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section (relating to the withholding from income of amounts payable as support) must provide for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of each absent parent against whom a support order is or has been issued or modified in the State, and is being enforced under the State plan, so much of such parent's wages (as defined by the State for purposes of this section) must be withheld, in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this subsection, as is necessary to comply with the order and provide for the payment of any fee to the employer which may be required under paragraph (6)(A), up to the maximum amount permitted under section 1673(b) of title 15. If there are arrearages to be collected, amounts withheld to satisfy such arrearages, when added to the amounts withheld to pay current support and provide for the fee, may not exceed the limit permitted under such section 1673(b), but the State need not withhold up to the maximum amount permitted under such section in order to satisfy arrearages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such withholding must be provided without the necessity of any application therefor in the case of a child (whether or not eligible for aid under part A of this subchapter) with respect to whom services are already being provided under the State plan under this part, and must be provided in accordance with this subsection on the basis of an application for services under the State plan in the case of any other child in whose behalf a support order has been issued or modified in the State. In either case such withholding must occur without the need for any amendment to the support order involved or for any further action (other than those actions required under this part) by the court or other entity which issued such order.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1271 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The wages of an absent parent shall be subject to such withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, in the case of a support order being enforced under this part that is issued or modified on or after the first day of the 25th month beginning after October 13, 1988, on the effective date of the order; except that such wages shall not be subject to such withholding under this subparagraph in any case where (i) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court (or administrative process) finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or (ii) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The wages of an absent parent shall become subject to such withholding, in the case of wages not subject to withholding under subparagraph (A), on the date on which the payments which the absent parent has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the date as of which the absent parent requests that such withholding begin,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the date as of which the custodial parent requests that such withholding begin, if the State determines, in accordance with such procedures and standards as it may establish, that the request should be approved, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) such earlier date as the State may select.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Such withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State, and (subject to subparagraph (B)) the State must send advance notice to each absent parent to whom paragraph (1) applies regarding the proposed withholding and the procedures such absent parent should follow if he or she desires to contest such withholding on the grounds that withholding (including the amount to be withheld) is not proper in the case involved because of mistakes of fact. If the absent parent contests such withholding on those grounds, the State shall determine whether such withholding will actually occur, shall (within no more than 45 days after the provision of such advance notice) inform such parent of whether or not withholding will occur and (if so) of the date on which it is to begin, and shall furnish such parent with the information contained in any notice given to the employer under paragraph (6)(A) with respect to such withholding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The requirement of advance notice set forth in the first sentence of subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of any State which has a system of income withholding for child support purposes in effect on August 16, 1984, if such system provides on that date, and continues to provide, such procedures as may be necessary to meet the procedural due process requirements of State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Such withholding must be administered by a public agency designated by the State, and the amounts withheld must be expeditiously distributed by the State or such agency in accordance with section 657 of this title under procedures (specified by the State) adequate to document payments of support and to track and monitor such payments, except that the State may establish or permit the establishment of alternative procedures for the collection and distribution of such amounts (under the supervision of such public agency) otherwise than through such public agency so long as the entity making such collection and distribution is publicly accountable for its actions taken in carrying out such procedures, and so long as such procedures will assure prompt distribution, provide for the keeping of adequate records to document payments of support, and permit the tracking and monitoring of such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A)(i) The employer of any absent parent to whom paragraph (1) applies, upon being given notice as described in clause (ii), must be required to withhold from such absent parent's wages the amount specified by such notice (which may include a fee, established by the State, to be paid to the employer unless waived by such employer) and pay such amount (after deducting and retaining any portion thereof which represents the fee so established) to the appropriate agency (or other entity authorized to collect the amounts withheld under the alternative procedures described in paragraph (5)) for distribution in accordance with section 657 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The notice given to the employer shall contain only such information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Methods must be established by the State to simplify the withholding process for employers to the greatest extent possible, including permitting any employer to combine all withheld amounts into a single payment to each appropriate agency or entity (with the portion thereof which is attributable to each individual employee being separately designated).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The employer must be held liable to the State for any amount which such employer fails to withhold from wages due an employee following receipt by such employer of proper notice under subparagraph (A), but such employer shall not be required to vary the normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Provision must be made for the imposition of a fine against any employer who discharges from employment, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against any absent parent subject to wage withholding required by this subsection because of the existence of such withholding and the obligations or additional obligations which it imposes upon the employer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Support collection under this subsection must be given priority over any other legal process under State law against the same wages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The State may take such actions as may be necessary to extend its system of withholding under this subsection so that such system will include withholding from forms of income other than wages, in order to assure that child support owed by absent parents in the State <!-- PDFPage:1272 -->will be collected without regard to the types of such absent parents&rsquo; income or the nature of their income-producing activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The State must extend its withholding system under this subsection so that such system will include withholding from income derived within such State in cases where the applicable support orders were issued in other States, in order to assure that child support owed by absent parents in such State or any other State will be collected without regard to the residence of the child for whom the support is payable or of such child's custodial parent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Provision must be made for terminating withholding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administration of support payments through State agency or other entity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State may at its option, under its plan approved under section 654 of this title, establish procedures under which support payments under this part will be made through the State agency or other entity which administers the State's income withholding system in any case where either the absent parent or the custodial parent requests it, even though no arrearages in child support payments are involved and no income withholding procedures have been instituted; but in any such case an annual fee for handling and processing such payments, in an amount not exceeding the actual costs incurred by the State in connection therewith or $25, whichever is less, shall be imposed on the requesting parent by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exemption of States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary, through the presentation to the Secretary of such data pertaining to caseloads, processing times, administrative costs, and average support collections, and such other data or estimates as the Secretary may specify, that the enactment of any law or the use of any procedure or procedures required by or pursuant to this section will not increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the State child support enforcement program, the Secretary may exempt the State, subject to the Secretary's continuing review and to termination of the exemption should circumstances change, from the requirement to enact the law or use the procedure or procedures involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Overdue support&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;overdue support&rdquo; means the amount of a delinquency pursuant to an obligation determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative process established under State law, for support and maintenance of a minor child which is owed to or on behalf of such child, or for support and maintenance of the absent parent's spouse (or former spouse) with whom the child is living if and to the extent that spousal support (with respect to such spouse or former spouse) would be included for purposes of paragraph (4) or (6) of section 654 of this title. At the option of the State, overdue support may include amounts which otherwise meet the definition in the first sentence of this subsection but which are owed to or on behalf of a child who is not a minor child. The option to include support owed to children who are not minors shall apply independently to each procedure specified under this section.</p>
