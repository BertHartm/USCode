<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the term &ldquo;child abuse&rdquo; shall not include discipline administered by a parent or legal guardian to his or her child provided it is reasonable in manner and moderate in degree and otherwise does not constitute cruelty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Agency designated to receive report and action to be taken</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For all Federal lands and all federally operated (or contracted) facilities in which children are cared for or reside, the Attorney General shall designate an agency to receive and investigate the reports described in subsection (a) of this section. By formal written agreement, the designated agency may be a non-Federal agency. When such reports are received by social services or health care agencies, and involve allegations of sexual abuse, serious physical injury, or life-threatening neglect of a child, there shall be an immediate referral of the report to a law enforcement agency with authority to take emergency action to protect the child. All reports received shall be promptly investigated, and whenever appropriate, investigations shall be conducted jointly by social services and law enforcement personnel, with a view toward avoiding unnecessary multiple interviews with the child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting form</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In every federally operated (or contracted) facility, and on all Federal lands, a standard written reporting form, with instructions, shall be disseminated to all mandated reporter groups.

If a person is sued because of the person's performance of one of the above functions, and the defendant prevails in the litigation, the court <!-- PDFPage:6155 -->may order that the plaintiff pay the defendant's legal expenses. Immunity shall not be accorded to persons acting in bad faith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Omitted</h4>
