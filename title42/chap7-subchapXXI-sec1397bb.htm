Such standards may include (to the extent consistent with this subchapter) those relating to the geographic areas to be served by the plan, age, income and resources (including any standards relating to spenddowns and disposition of resources), residency, disability status (so long as any standard relating to such status does not restrict eligibility), access to or coverage under other health coverage, and duration of eligibility. Such standards may not discriminate on the basis of diagnosis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The plan shall include a description of procedures to be used to ensure&mdash;</p>

Such procedures shall be established and revised as often as the State determines appropriate to take into account the most recent information available to the State identifying such barriers.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deemed compliance if joint application and renewal process that permits application other than in person</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State shall be deemed to comply with subparagraph (A) if the State's application and renewal forms and supplemental forms (if any) and information verification process is the same for purposes of establishing and renewing eligibility for children and pregnant women for medical assistance under subchapter XIX and child health assistance under this subchapter, and such process does not require an application to be made in person or a face-to-face interview.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Nonentitlement</h4>
