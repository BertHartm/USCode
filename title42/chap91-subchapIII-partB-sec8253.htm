<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Energy management requirement for Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than January 1, 2005, each agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, install in Federal buildings owned by the United States all energy and water conservation measures with payback periods of less than 10 years, as determined by using the methods and procedures developed pursuant to section 8254 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection for any agency for such periods as the Secretary may determine if the Secretary finds that the agency is taking all practicable steps to meet the requirements and that the requirements of this subsection will pose an unacceptable burden upon the agency. If the Secretary waives the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall, as part of the report required under section 8258(b) of this title, notify the Congress in writing with an explanation and a justification of the reasons for such waiver.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A finding of impracticability under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the energy intensiveness of activities carried out in the Federal building or collection of Federal buildings; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the fact that the Federal building or collection of Federal buildings is used in the performance of a national security function.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each agency shall identify and list, in each report made under section 8258(a) of this title, the Federal buildings designated by it for such exclusion. The Secretary shall review such findings for consistency with the standards for exclusion set forth in paragraph (1), and may within 90 days after receipt of the findings, reverse the exclusion. In the case of any such reversal, the agency shall comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b)(1) of this section for the building concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not later than 180 days after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall issue guidelines that establish criteria for exclusions under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Implementation steps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of General Services in developing guidelines for the implementation of this part. To meet the requirements of this section, each agency shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">By October 1, 2012, in accordance with guidelines established by the Secretary under paragraph (2), all Federal buildings shall, for the purposes of efficient use of energy and reduction in the cost of electricity used in such buildings, be metered. Each agency shall use, to the maximum extent practicable, advanced meters or advanced metering devices that provide data at least daily and that measure at least hourly consumption of electricity in the Federal buildings of the agency. Such data shall be incorporated into existing Federal energy tracking systems and made available to Federal facility managers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Guidelines</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) establish exclusions from the requirements specified in paragraph (1) based on the de minimis quantity of energy use of a Federal building, industrial process, or structure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 6 months after the date guidelines are established under paragraph (2), in a report submitted by the agency under section 8258(a) of this title, each agency shall submit to the Secretary a plan describing how the agency will implement the requirements of paragraph (1), including (A) how the agency will designate personnel primarily responsible for achieving the requirements and (B) demonstration by the agency, complete with docu<!-- PDFPage:5785 -->mentation, of any finding that advanced meters or advanced metering devices, as defined in paragraph (1), are not practicable.</p>
