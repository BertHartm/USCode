<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 101 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;193 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successful society which promotes the interests of children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families with children had a child support order established and, of that 54 percent, only about one-half received the full amount due. Of the cases enforced through the public child support enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a collection.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families with dependent children (in this section referred to as &lsquo;AFDC&rsquo;) has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-thirds of these recipients are children. Eighty-nine percent of children receiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in which no father is present.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A)(i) The average monthly number of children receiving AFDC benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(I) was 3,300,000 in 1965;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(II) was 6,200,000 in 1970;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(III) was 7,400,000 in 1980; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1438 --><p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(IV) was 9,300,000 in 1992.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) While the number of children receiving AFDC benefits increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992, the total number of children in the United States aged 0 to 18 has declined by 5.5 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDC benefits within 10 years.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) The increase in the number of children receiving public assistance is closely related to the increase in births to unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the percentage of live births to unmarried women increased nearly threefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births is well documented as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teen pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991. The overall rate of nonmarital pregnancy rose 14 percent from 90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried women in 1980 to 103 in both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the overall pregnancy rate for married couples decreased 7.3 percent between 1980 and 1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000 married women in 1980 to 117.6 pregnancies in 1991.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 1970 and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent and if the current trend continues, 50 percent of all births by the year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy must address the issue of male responsibility, including statutory rape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe and is linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are significantly older.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) It is estimated that in the late 1980's, the rate for girls age 14 and under giving birth increased 26 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Data indicates that at least half of the children born to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men. Available data suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teenage girls are fathered by men over age 20.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Surveys of teen mothers have revealed that a majority of such mothers have histories of sexual and physical abuse, primarily with older adult men.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth on the mother, the child, the family, and society are well documented as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Young women 17 and under who give birth outside of marriage are more likely to go on public assistance and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled. These combined effects of &lsquo;younger and longer&rsquo; increase total AFDC costs per household by 25 percent to 30 percent for 17-year-olds.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantially higher risk of being born at a very low or moderately low birth weight.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely to experience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as more child abuse, and neglect.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces the chances of the child growing up to have an intact marriage.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent homes were born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that of children in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced (37 percent). While many parents find themselves, through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, facing the difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless, the negative consequences of raising children in single-parent homes are well documented as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with children under 18 years of age have income below the national poverty level. In contrast, 46 percent of female-headed households with children under 18 years of age are below the national poverty level.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Among single-parent families, nearly 1/2 of the mothers who never married received AFDC while only 1/5 of divorced mothers received AFDC.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Children born into families receiving welfare assistance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they reach adulthood than children not born into families receiving welfare.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the greatest risk of bearing low birth weight babies.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) The younger the single-parent mother, the less likely she is to finish high school.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) Young women who have children before finishing high school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a longer period of time.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of births to teenage mothers under the aid to families with dependent children program, the food stamp program, and the medicaid program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(H) The absence of a father in the life of a child has a negative effect on school performance and peer adjustment.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(I) Children of teenage single parents have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times more likely to fail and repeat a year in grade school than are children from intact 2-parent families.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4 times more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youth aged 12 through 20 and areas with higher percentages of single-parent households have higher rates of violent crime.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses within the State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived primarily in a home with both parents. In contrast to these incarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62,800,000 children in the Nation's resident population were living with both parents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisis in our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock birth are very important Government interests and the policy contained in part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [this part] (as amended by section 103(a) of this Act) is intended to address the crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Require a parent or caretaker receiving assistance under the program to engage in work (as defined by the State) once the State determines the parent or caretaker is ready to engage in work, or once the parent or caretaker has received assistance under the program for 24 months (whether or not consecutive), whichever is earlier, consistent with section 607(e)(2) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Ensure that parents and caretakers receiving assistance under the program engage in work activities in accordance with section 607 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Take such reasonable steps as the State deems necessary to restrict the use and disclosure of information about individuals and families receiving assistance under the program attributable to funds provided by the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Establish goals and take action to prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, with special emphasis on teenage pregnancies, and establish numerical goals for reducing the illegitimacy ratio of the State (as defined in section 603(a)(2)(C)(iii) of this title) for calendar years 1996 through 2005.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) Conduct a program, designed to reach State and local law enforcement officials, the education system, and relevant counseling services, that provides education and training on the problem of statutory rape so that teenage pregnancy prevention programs may be expanded in scope to include men.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The document shall indicate whether the State intends to treat families moving into the State from another State differently than other families under the program, and if so, how the State intends to treat such families under the program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The document shall set forth objective criteria for the delivery of benefits and the determination of eligibility and for fair and equitable treatment, including an explanation of how the State will provide opportunities for recipients who have been adversely affected to be heard in a State administrative or appeal process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Not later than 1 year after August 22, 1996, unless the chief executive officer of the State opts out of this provision by notifying the Secretary, a State shall, consistent with the exception provided in section 607(e)(2) of this title, require a parent or caretaker receiving assistance under the program who, after receiving such assistance for 2 months is not exempt from work requirements and is not engaged in work, as determined under section 607(c) of this title, to participate in community service employment, with minimum hours per week and tasks to be determined by the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification that the State will operate a child support enforcement program</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certification of the administration of the program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certification by the chief executive officer of the State specifying which State agency or agencies will administer and supervise the program referred to in paragraph (1) for the fiscal year, which shall include assurances that local governments and private sector organizations&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) refer such individuals to counseling and supportive services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) waive, pursuant to a determination of good cause, other program requirements such as time limits (for so long as necessary) for individuals receiving assistance, residency requirements, child support cooperation requirements, and family cap provisions, in cases where compliance with such requirements would make it more difficult for individuals receiving assistance under this part to escape domestic violence or unfairly penalize such individuals who are or have been victimized by such violence, or individuals who are at risk of further domestic violence.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Assets for Independence Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 402. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Economic well-being does not come solely from income, spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, investment, and accumulation of assets because assets can improve economic independence and stability, connect individuals with a viable and hopeful future, stimulate development of human and other capital, and enhance the welfare of offspring.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Fully 1/2 of all Americans have either no, negligible, or negative assets available for investment, just as the price of entry to the economic mainstream, the cost of a house, an adequate education, and starting a business, is increasing. Further, the household savings rate of the United States lags far behind other industrial nations, presenting a barrier to economic growth.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United States should invest existing resources in high-yield initiatives. There is reason to believe that the financial returns, including increased income, tax revenue, and decreased welfare cash assistance, resulting from individual development accounts will far exceed the cost of investment in those accounts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Traditional public assistance programs concentrating on income and consumption have rarely been successful in promoting and supporting the transition to increased economic self-sufficiency. Income-based domestic policy should be complemented with asset-based policy because, while income-based policies ensure that consumption needs (including food, child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, asset-based policies provide the means to achieve greater independence and economic well-being.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 403. PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purposes of this title are to provide for the establishment of demonstration projects designed to determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the social, civic, psychological, and economic effects of providing to individuals and families with limited means an incentive to accumulate assets by saving a portion of their earned income;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the extent to which an asset-based policy that promotes saving for postsecondary education, homeownership, and microenterprise development may be used to enable individuals and families with limited means to increase their economic self-sufficiency; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the extent to which an asset-based policy stabilizes and improves families and the community in which the families live.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 404. DEFINITIONS.</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nondiscrimination against religious organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event a State exercises its authority under subsection (a) of this section, religious organizations are eligible, on the same basis as any other private organization, as contractors to provide assistance, or to accept certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement, under any program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section so long as the programs are implemented consistent with the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution. Except as provided in subsection (k) of this section, neither the Federal Government nor a State receiving funds under such programs shall discriminate against an organization which is or applies to be a contractor to provide assistance, or which accepts certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement, on the basis that the organization has a religious character.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Religious character and freedom</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Religious organizations</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to be eligible to contract to provide assistance, or to accept certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement, funded under a program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual described in paragraph (2) has an objection to the religious character of the organization or institution from which the individual receives, or would receive, assistance funded under any program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, the State in which the individual resides shall provide such individual (if otherwise eligible for such assistance) within a reasonable period of time after the date of such objection with assistance from an alternative provider that is accessible to the individual and the value of which is not less than the value of the assistance which the individual would have received from such organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Individual described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual described in this paragraph is an individual who receives, applies for, or requests to apply for, assistance under a program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nondiscrimination against beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in law, a religious organization shall not discriminate against an individual in regard to rendering assistance funded under any program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section on the basis of religion, a religious belief, or refusal to actively participate in a religious practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fiscal accountability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), any religious organization contracting to provide assistance funded under any program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be subject to the same regulations as other contractors to account in accord with generally accepted auditing principles for the use of such funds provided under such programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limited audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If such organization segregates Federal funds provided under such programs into separate accounts, then only the financial assistance provided with such funds shall be subject to audit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any party which seeks to enforce its rights under this section may assert a civil action for injunctive relief exclusively in an appropriate State court against the entity or agency that allegedly commits such violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Limitations on use of funds for certain purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds provided directly to institutions or organizations to provide services and administer programs under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section shall be expended for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization.</p>

Such regulations shall place the burden on the Secretary to prove that such families were diverted as a direct result of differences in such eligibility criteria.</p>

Such available amounts shall be redistributed to a State pursuant to section 603(n) of this title (as such section was in effect before October 1, 1995) by substituting &ldquo;the number of children residing in all States applying for such funds&rdquo; for &ldquo;the number of children residing in the United States in the second preceding fiscal year&rdquo;.</p>
