<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definition of energy intensity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;energy intensity&rdquo; means the primary energy consumed for each unit of physical output in an industrial process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Voluntary agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into voluntary agreements with one or more persons in industrial sectors that consume significant quantities of primary energy for each unit of physical output to reduce the energy intensity of the production activities of the persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Goal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Voluntary agreements under this section shall have as a goal the reduction of energy intensity by not less than 2.5 percent each year during the period of calendar years 2007 through 2016.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Recognition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in cooperation with other appropriate Federal agencies, shall develop mechanisms to recognize and publicize the achievements of participants in voluntary agreements under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Technical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person that enters into an agreement under this section and continues to make a good faith effort to achieve the energy efficiency goals specified in the agreement shall be eligible to receive from the Secretary a grant or technical assistance, as appropriate, to assist in the achievement of those goals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than each of June 30, 2012, and June 30, 2017, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) evaluates the success of the voluntary agreements under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provides independent verification of a sample of the energy savings estimates provided by participating firms.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;15812. Advanced Building Efficiency Testbed</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with the Administrator of General Services, shall establish an Advanced Building Efficiency Testbed program for the development, testing, and demonstration of advanced engineering systems, components, and materials to enable innovations in building technologies. The program shall evaluate efficiency concepts for government and industry buildings, and demonstrate the ability of next generation buildings to support individual and organizational productivity and health (including by improving indoor air quality) as well as flexibility and technological change to improve environmental sustainability. Such program shall complement and not duplicate existing national programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program established under subsection (a) shall be led by a university with the ability to combine the expertise from numerous academic fields including, at a minimum, intelligent workplaces and advanced building systems and engineering, electrical and computer engineering, computer science, architecture, urban design, and environmental and mechanical engineering. Such university shall partner with <!-- PDFPage:7256 -->other universities and entities who have established programs and the capability of advancing innovative building efficiency technologies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary to carry out this section $6,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2006 through 2008, to remain available until expended. For any fiscal year in which funds are expended under this section, the Secretary shall provide one-third of the total amount to the lead university described in subsection (b), and provide the remaining two-thirds to the other participants referred to in subsection (b) on an equal basis.</p>
