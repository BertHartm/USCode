<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Development authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may initiate activities to develop the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Technologies identified as necessary elements of missions beyond low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In-space capabilities such as refueling and storage technology, orbital transfer stages, innovative in-space propulsion technology, communications, and data manage<!-- PDFPage:8178 -->ment that facilitate a broad range of users (including military and commercial) and applications defining the architecture and design of such missions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Spacesuit development and associated life support technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Flagship missions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing technologies and capabilities under subsection (a), the Administrator may make investments&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in space technologies such as advanced propulsion, propellant depots, in situ resource utilization, and robotic payloads or capabilities that enable human missions beyond low-Earth orbit ultimately leading to Mars;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in a space-based transfer vehicle including these technologies with an ability to conduct space-based operations that provide capabilities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to integrate with the Space Launch System and other space-based systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide opportunities for in-space servicing of and delivery to multiple space-based platforms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to facilitate international efforts to expand human presence to deep space destinations;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in advanced life support technologies and capabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in technologies and capabilities relating to in-space power, propulsion, and energy systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in technologies and capabilities relating to in-space propellant transfer and storage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in technologies and capabilities relating to in situ resource utilization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in expanded research to understand the greatest biological impediments to human deep space missions, especially the radiation challenge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Utilization of ISS as testbed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may utilize the ISS as a testbed for any technology or capability developed under subsection (a) in a manner consistent with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall coordinate development of technologies and capabilities under this section through an overall agency technology approach, as authorized by section 905 of this Act.</p>
