Such rule shall define affiliate relationships and significant ownership interests.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such lands have extremely high cost exploration or development problems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) exploration and development will not occur on such lands unless such exemption is granted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Findings of the Secretary under this subsection shall be final, and shall not be invalidated unless found to be arbitrary or capricious.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unitization of producing fields</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall study and report to the Congress, not later than 6 months after December 22, 1975, with respect to the feasibility and desirability of extending the prohibition on joint bidding to&mdash;</p>
