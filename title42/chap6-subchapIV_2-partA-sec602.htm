<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Conduct a program, designed to serve all political subdivisions in the State (not necessarily in a uniform manner), that provides assistance to needy families with (or expecting) children and provides parents with job preparation, work, and support services to enable them to leave the program and become self-sufficient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Require a parent or caretaker receiving assistance under the program to engage in work (as defined by the State) once the State determines the parent or caretaker is ready to engage in work, or once the parent or caretaker has received assistance under the program for 24 months (whether or not consecutive), whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Ensure that parents and caretakers receiving assistance under the program engage in work activities in accordance with section 607 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Take such reasonable steps as the State deems necessary to restrict the use and disclosure of information about individuals and families receiving assistance under the program attributable to funds provided by the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Establish goals and take action to prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, with special emphasis on teenage pregnancies, and establish numerical goals for reducing the illegitimacy ratio of the State (as defined in section 603(a)(2)(B) of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#602_1_target" name="602_1">1</a></sup>) for calendar years 1996 through 2005.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The document shall indicate whether the State intends to treat families moving into the State from another State differently than other families under the program, and if so, how the State intends to treat such families under the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The document shall indicate whether the State intends to provide assistance under the program to individuals who are not citizens of the United States, and if so, shall include an overview of such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The document shall set forth objective criteria for the delivery of benefits and the determination of eligibility and for fair and equitable treatment, including an explanation of how the State will provide opportunities for recipients who have been adversely affected to be heard in a State administrative or appeal process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Not later than 1 year after August 22, 1996, unless the chief executive officer of the State opts out of this provision by notifying the Secretary, a State shall, consistent with the exception provided in section 607(e)(2) of this title, require a parent or caretaker receiving assistance under the program who, after receiving such assistance for 2 months is not exempt from work requirements and is not engaged in work, as determined under section 607(c) of this title, to participate in community service employment, with minimum hours per week and tasks to be determined by the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification that the State will operate a child support enforcement program</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certification of the administration of the program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certification by the chief executive officer of the State specifying which State agency or agencies will administer and supervise the program referred to in paragraph (1) for the fiscal year, which shall include assurances that local governments and private sector organizations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have been consulted regarding the plan and design of welfare services in the State so that services are provided in a manner appropriate to local populations; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) waive, pursuant to a determination of good cause, other program requirements such as time limits (for so long as necessary) for individuals receiving assistance, residency requirements, child support cooperation requirements, and family cap provisions, in cases where compliance with such requirements would make it more difficult for individuals receiving assistance under this part to escape domestic violence or unfairly penalize such individuals who are or have been victimized by such violence, or individuals who are at risk of further domestic violence.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Domestic violence&rdquo; defined</h4>
