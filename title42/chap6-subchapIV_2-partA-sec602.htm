<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for financial participation by the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) either provide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency to administer the plan, or provide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency to supervise the administration of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim for aid to families with dependent children is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide such methods of administration (including after January 1, 1940, methods relating to the establishment and maintenance of personnel standards on a merit basis, except that the Secretary shall exercise no authority with respect to the selection, tenure of office, and compensation of any individual employed in accordance with such methods) as are found by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide that the State agency will make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary may from time to time require, and comply with such provisions as the Secretary may from time to time find necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) except as may be otherwise provided in paragraph (8) or (31) and section 615 of this title, provide that the State agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid to families with dependent children, or of any other individual (living in the same home as such child and relative) whose needs the State determines should be considered in determining the need of the child or relative claiming such aid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall determine ineligible for aid any family the combined value of whose resources (reduced by any obligations or debts with respect to such resources) exceeds $1,000 or such lower amount as the State may determine, but not including as a resource for purposes of this subparagraph (i) a home owned and occupied by such child, relative, or other individual and so much of the family member's ownership interest in one automobile as does not exceed such amount as the Secretary may prescribe, (ii) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, burial plots (one for each such child, relative, and other individual), and funeral agreements&nbsp;<sup><a href="#602_1_target" name="602_1">1</a></sup> (iii) for such period or periods of time as the Secretary may prescribe, real property which the family is making a good-faith effort to dispose of, but any aid payable to the family for any such period shall be conditioned upon such disposal, and any payments of such aid for that period shall (at the time of the disposal) be considered overpayments to the extent that they would not have been made had the disposal occurred at the beginning of the period for which the payments of such aid were made, or (iv) for the month of receipt and the following month, any refund of Federal income taxes made to such family by reason of section 32 of the Internal Reve<!-- PDFPage:1168 -->nue Code of 1986 (relating to earned income credit), and any payment made to such family by an employer under section 3507 of such Code (relating to advance payment of earned income credit); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may, in the case of a family claiming or receiving aid under this part for any month, take into consideration as income (to the extent the State determines appropriate, as specified in such plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of law)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an amount not to exceed the value of the family's monthly allotment of food stamp coupons, to the extent such value duplicates the amount for food included in the maximum amount that would be payable under the State plan to a family of the same composition with no other income; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an amount not to exceed the value of any rent or housing subsidy provided to such family, to the extent such value duplicates the amount for housing included in the maximum amount that would be payable under the State plan to a family of the same composition with no other income;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8)(A) provide that, with respect to any month, in making the determination under paragraph (7), the State agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall disregard all of the earned income of each dependent child receiving aid to families with dependent children who is (as determined by the State in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) a full-time student or a part-time student who is not a full-time employee attending a school, college, or university, or a course of vocational or technical training designed to fit him for gainful employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) shall disregard from the earned income of any child or relative applying for or receiving aid to families with dependent children, or of any other individual (living in the same home as such relative and child) whose needs are taken into account in making such determination, the first $90 of the total of such earned income for such month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) after applying the other clauses of this subparagraph, shall disregard from the earned income of any child, relative, or other individual specified in clause (ii), an amount equal to expenditures for care in such month for a dependent child, or an incapacitated individual living in the same home as the dependent child, receiving aid to families with dependent children and requiring such care for such month, to the extent that such amount (for each such dependent child or incapacitated individual) does not exceed $175 (or such lesser amount as the Secretary may prescribe in the case of an individual not engaged in full-time employment or not employed throughout the month), or, in the case such child is under age 2, $200;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) shall disregard from the earned income of any child or relative receiving aid to families with dependent children, or of any other individual (living in the same home as such relative and child) whose needs are taken into account in making such determination, an amount equal to (I) the first $30 of the total of such earned income not disregarded under any other clause of this subparagraph plus (II) one-third of the remainder thereof;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) shall disregard the first $50 of any child support payments for such month received in that month, and the first $50 of child support payments for each prior month received in that month if such payments were made by the absent parent in the month when due, with respect to the dependent child or children in any family applying for or receiving aid to families with dependent children (including support payments collected and paid to the family under section 657(b) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) may disregard all or any part of the earned income of a dependent child who is a full-time student and who is applying for aid to families with dependent children, but only if the earned income of such child is excluded for such month in determining the family's total income under paragraph (18); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(viii) shall disregard any refund of Federal income taxes made to a family receiving aid to families with dependent children by reason of section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to earned income tax credit) and any payment made to such a family by an employer under section 3507 of such Code (relating to advance payment of earned income credit); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall not disregard, under clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (A), any earned income of any one of the persons specified in subparagraph (A)(ii) if such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) terminated his employment or reduced his earned income without good cause within such period (of not less than thirty days) preceding such month as may be prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) refused without good cause, within such period preceding such month as may be prescribed by the Secretary, to accept employment in which he is able to engage which is offered through the public employment offices of the State, or is otherwise offered by an employer if the offer of such employer is determined by the State or local agency administering the State plan, after notification by the employer, to be a bona fide offer of employment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) failed without good cause to make a timely report (as prescribed by the State plan pursuant to paragraph (14)) to the State agency of earned income received in such month; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1169 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii)(I) shall not disregard&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) in the case of the earned income of a person with respect to whom subparagraph (A)(iv) has been applied for four consecutive months, shall not apply the provisions of subclause (II) of such subparagraph to any month after such month, or apply the provisions of subclause (I) of such subparagraph to any month after the eighth month following such month, for so long as he continues to receive aid under the plan, and shall not apply the provisions of either such subclause to any month thereafter until the expiration of an additional period of twelve consecutive months during which he is not a recipient of such aid; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide that in implementing this paragraph the term &ldquo;earned income&rdquo; shall mean gross earned income, prior to any deductions for taxes or for any other purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide safeguards which restrict the use or disclosure of information concerning applicants or recipients to purposes directly connected with (A) the administration of the plan of the State approved under this part (including activities under part F of this subchapter), the plan or program of the State under part B, D, or E of this subchapter or under subchapter I, X, XIV, XVI, XIX, or XX of this chapter, or the supplemental security income program established by subchapter XVI of this chapter, (B) any investigation, prosecution, or criminal or civil proceeding, conducted in connection with the administration of any such plan or program, (C) the administration of any other Federal or federally assisted program which provides assistance, in cash or in kind, or services, directly to individuals on the basis of need, (D) any audit or similar activity conducted in connection with the administration of any such plan or program by any governmental entity which is authorized by law to conduct such audit or activity, and (E) reporting and providing information pursuant to paragraph (16) to appropriate authorities with respect to known or suspected child abuse or neglect; and the safeguards so provided shall prohibit disclosure, to any committee or legislative body (other than an entity referred to in clause (D) with respect to an activity referred to in such clause), of any information which identifies by name or address any such applicant or recipient; but such safeguards shall not prevent the State agency or the local agency responsible for the administration of the State plan in the locality (whether or not the State has enacted legislation allowing public access to Federal welfare records) from furnishing a State or local law enforcement officer, upon his request, with the current address of any recipient if the officer furnishes the agency with such recipient's name and social security account number and satisfactorily demonstrates that such recipient is a fugitive felon, that the location or apprehension of such felon is within the officer's official duties, and that the request is made in the proper exercise of those duties;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) provide&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) if an exempt participant drops out of the program without good cause after having commenced participation in the program, he or she shall thereafter not be given priority so long as other individuals are actively seeking to participate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the State need not require or allow participation of an individual in the program if as a result of such participation the amount payable to the State for quarters in a fiscal year with respect to the program would be reduced pursuant to section 603(<em>l</em>)(2) of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to the extent that the program is available in the political subdivision involved and State resources otherwise permit, in the case of a custodial parent who has not attained 20 years of age, has not successfully completed a high-school education (or its equivalent), and is required to participate in the program (including an individual who would otherwise be exempt from participation in the program solely by reason of subparagraph (C)(iii)), the State agency (subject to clause (ii)) will require such parent to participate in an educational activity; and</p>
