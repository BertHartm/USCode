<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Consideration of standard</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 180 days after the receipt by a State regulatory authority (with respect to each electric utility for which the authority has ratemaking authority), or nonregulated electric utility, of a request from a project sponsor or owner or operator, the State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide public notice and conduct a hearing respecting the standard established by subsection (b); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) on the basis of the hearing, consider and make a determination whether or not it is appropriate to implement the standard to carry out the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Relationship to State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of any determination under paragraph (1) and any review of the determination in any court, the purposes of this section supplement otherwise applicable State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Nonadoption of standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this part prohibits any State regulatory authority or nonregulated electric utility from making any determination that it is not appropriate to adopt any standard described in paragraph (1), pursuant to authority under otherwise applicable State law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standard for sales of excess power</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the standard referred to in subsection (a) shall provide that an owner or operator of a waste energy recovery project identified on the Registry that generates net excess power shall be eligible to benefit from at least 1 of the options described in subsection (c) for disposal of the net excess power in accordance with the rate conditions and limitations described in subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Options</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The options referred to in subsection (b) are as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Sale of net excess power to utility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The electric utility shall purchase the net excess power from the owner or operator of the eligible waste energy recovery project during the operation of the project under a contract entered into for that purpose.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transport by utility for direct sale to third party</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The electric utility shall transmit the net excess power on behalf of the project owner or operator to up to 3 separate locations on the system of the utility for direct sale by the owner or operator to third parties at those locations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Transport over private transmission lines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State and the electric utility shall permit, and shall waive or modify such laws as would otherwise prohibit, the construction and operation of private electric wires constructed, owned, and operated by the project owner or operator, to transport the power to up to 3 purchasers within a 3-mile radius of the project, allowing the wires to use or cross public rights-of-way, without subjecting the project to regulation as a public utility, and according the wires the same treatment for safety, zoning, land use, and other legal privileges as apply or would apply to the wires of the utility, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there shall be no grant of any power of eminent domain to take or cross private property for the wires; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the wires shall be physically segregated and not interconnected with any portion of the system of the utility, except on the customer side of the revenue meter of the utility and in a manner that precludes any possible export of the electricity onto the utility system, or disruption of the system.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Agreed on alternatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The utility and the owner or operator of the project may reach agreement on any alternate arrangement and payments or rates associated with the arrangement that is mutually satisfactory and in accord with State law.</p>
