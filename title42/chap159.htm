<h3 class="section-head">&sect;18301. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States human space flight program has, since the first Mercury flight on May 5, 1961, been a source of pride and inspiration for the Nation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The establishment of and commitment to human exploration goals is essential for providing the necessary long term focus and programmatic consistency and robustness of the United States civilian space program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The National Aeronautics and Space Administration is and should remain a multi-mission agency with a balanced and robust set of core missions in science, aeronautics, and human space flight and exploration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In the 50 years since the establishment of NASA, the arena of space has evolved substantially. As the uses and users of space continue to expand, the issues and operations in the regions closest to Earth have become increasingly complex, with a growing number of overlaps between civil, commercial and national security activities. These developments present opportunities and challenges to the space activities of NASA and the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The extraordinary challenges of achieving access to space both motivated and accelerated the development of technologies and industrial capabilities that have had widespread applications which have contributed to the technological excellence of the United States. It is essential to tie space activity to human challenges ranging from enhancing the influence, relationships, security, economic development, and commerce of the United States to improving the overall human condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) It is essential to the economic well-being of the United States that the aerospace industrial capacity, highly skilled workforce, and embedded expertise remain engaged in demanding, challenging, and exciting efforts that ensure United States leadership in space exploration and related activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Crewmembers provide the essential component to ensure the return on investment from and the growth and safe operation of the ISS. The Russian Soyuz vehicle has allowed continued human presence on the ISS for United States crewmembers with its ability to serve as both a routine and backup capability for crew delivery, rescue, and return. With the impending retirement of the Space Shuttle, the United States will find itself with no national crew delivery and return system. Without any other system, the United States and all the ISS partners will have no redundant system for human access to and from the ISS. It is therefore essential that a United States capability be developed as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Existing and emerging United States commercial launch capabilities and emerging launch capabilities offer the potential for providing crew support assets. New capabilities for human crew access to the ISS should be developed in a manner that ensures ISS mission assurance and safety. Commercial services offer the potential to broaden the availability and access to space at lower costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) While commercial transportation systems have the promise to contribute valuable services, it is in the United States national interest to maintain a government operated space transportation system for crew and cargo delivery to space.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Congress restates its commitment, expressed in the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18301_1_target" name="18301_1">1</a></sup> (Public Law 109&ndash;155) and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18301_1_target" name="18301_1">1</a></sup> (Public Law 110&ndash;422), to the development of commercially developed launch and delivery systems to the ISS for crew and cargo missions. Congress reaffirms that NASA shall make use of United States commercially provided ISS crew transfer and crew rescue services to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) It is critical to identify an appropriate combination of NASA and related United States Government programs, while providing a framework that allows partnering, leveraging and stimulation of the existing and emerging commercial and international efforts in both near Earth space and the regions beyond.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The designation of the United States segment of the ISS as a National Laboratory, as provided by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18301_1_target" name="18301_1">1</a></sup> and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2008,<sup><a href="#18301_1_target" name="18301_1">1</a></sup> provides an opportunity for multiple United States Government agencies, university-based researchers, research organizations, and others to utilize the unique environment of microgravity for fundamental scientific research and potential economic development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) For some potential replacement elements necessary for ISS sustainability, the Space Shuttle may represent the only vehicle, existing or planned, capable of carrying those elements to the ISS in the near term. Additional or alternative transportation capabilities must be identified as contingency delivery options, and accompanied by an independent analysis of projected availability of such capabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) The United States must develop, as rapidly as possible, replacement vehicles capable of providing both human and cargo launch capability to low-Earth orbit and to destinations beyond low-Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) There is a need for national space and export control policies that protect the national security of the United States while also enabling the United States and its aerospace industry to undertake cooperative programs in science and human space flight in an effective and efficient manner and to compete effectively in the global market place.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extension of the human presence from low-Earth orbit to other regions of space beyond low-Earth orbit will enable missions to the surface of the Moon and missions to deep space destinations such as near-Earth asteroids and Mars.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The regions of cis-lunar space are accessible to other national and commercial launch capabilities, and such access raises a host of national security concerns and economic implications that international human space endeavors can help to address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The ability to support human missions in regions beyond low-Earth orbit and on the surface of the Moon can also drive developments in emerging areas of space infrastructure and technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Developments in space infrastructure and technology can stimulate and enable increased space applications, such as in-space servicing, propellant resupply and transfer, and in situ resource utilization, and open opportunities for additional users of space, whether national, commercial, or international.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A long term objective for human exploration of space should be the eventual international exploration of Mars.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Future international missions beyond low-Earth orbit should be designed to incorporate capability development and availability, affordability, and international contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Human space flight and future exploration beyond low-Earth orbit should be based around a pay-as-you-go approach. Requirements in new launch and crew systems authorized in this chapter should be scaled to the minimum necessary to meet the core national mission capability needed to conduct cis-lunar missions. These initial missions, along with the development of new technologies and in-space capabilities can form the foundation for missions to other destinations. These initial missions also should provide operational experience prior to the further human expansion into space.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report on international collaboration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 120 days after October 11, 2010, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the following assets and capabilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Any effort by NASA to expand and ensure effective international collaboration on the ISS.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8176 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The efforts of NASA, including its approach and progress, in defining near-term, cis-lunar space human missions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) NASA contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In preparing the report required by paragraph (1), the Administrator shall assume that NASA will contribute to the efforts described in that paragraph the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A Space Launch System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A multi-purpose crew vehicle.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States has led the world in the scientific exploration of space for nearly 50 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Missions such as Viking, Voyager, Cassini, and New Horizons have greatly expanded knowledge of our solar system and planetary characteristics and evolution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Radioisotope power systems are the only available power sources for deep space missions making it possible to travel to such distant destinations as Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Pluto, and beyond and maintain operational control and systems viability for extended mission durations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Current radioisotope power systems supplies and production will not fully support NASA missions planned even in the next decade and, without a new domestic production capability, the United States will no longer have the means to explore the majority of the solar system by the end of this decade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Continuing to rely on Russia or other foreign sources for radioisotope power system fuel production is not a secure option.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Reestablishing domestic production will require a long lead-time. Thus, meeting future space exploration mission needs requires that a restart project begin at the earliest opportunity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Energy, pursue a joint approach beginning in fiscal year 2011 towards restarting and sustaining the domestic production of radioisotope thermoelectric generator material for deep space and other science and exploration missions. Funds authorized by this chapter for NASA shall be made available under a reimbursable agreement with the Department of Energy for the purpose of reestablishing facilities to produce fuel required for radioisotope thermoelectric generators to enable future missions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 120 days after October 11, 2010, the Administrator and the Secretary of Energy shall submit a joint report to the appropriate committees of Congress on coordinated agreements, planned implementation, and anticipated schedule, production quantities, and mission applications under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;18441. National and international orbital debris mitigation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A national and international effort is needed to develop a coordinated approach towards the prevention, negation, and removal of orbital debris.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The guidelines issued by the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee provide a consensus understanding of 10 national space agencies (including NASA) plus the European Space Agency on the necessity of mitigating the creation of space debris and measures for doing so. NASA's participation on the Committee should be robust, and NASA should urge other space-relevant Federal agencies (including the Departments of State, Defense, and Commerce) to work to ensure that their counterpart agencies in foreign governments are aware of these national commitments and the importance in which the United States holds them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Key components of such an approach should include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a process for debris prevention through agreements regarding spacecraft design, operations, and end-of-life disposition plans to minimize orbiting vehicles or elements which are nonfunctional;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the development of a robust Space Situational Awareness network that can identify potential collisions and provide sufficient trajectory and orbital data to enable avoidance maneuvers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the interagency development of an overall strategy for review by the President, with recommendations for proposed international collaborative efforts to address this challenge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) International discussion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall, in consultation with such other departments and agencies of the Federal Government as the Administrator considers appropriate, continue and strengthen discussions with the representatives of other space-faring countries, within the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee and elsewhere, to deal with this orbital debris mitigation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interagency effort</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of carrying out this subsection, the Director of OSTP, in coordination with the Director of the National Security Council and using the President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology coordinating mechanism, shall develop an overall strategy for review by the President, with recommendations for proposed international collaborative efforts to address this challenge.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The James Webb Space Telescope has exceeded its cost estimate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In 2007 the Government Accountability Office issued a report on NASA's high risk acquisition performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In response, NASA prepared a corrective action plan two years ago.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reports</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reports required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 90 days after October 11, 2010, and not later than April 30 of each year thereafter, the Administrator shall submit to the appropriate committees of Congress a report on the implementation during the preceding year for the corrective action plan referred to in subsection (a)(4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Elements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each report under this subsection shall set forth, for the year covered by such report, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A description of each NASA program that has exceeded its cost baseline by 15 percent or more or is more than 2 years behind its projected development schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) For each program specified under subparagraph (A), a plan for such decrease in scope or requirements, or other measures, to be undertaken to control cost and schedule, including any cost monitoring or corrective actions undertaken pursuant to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109&ndash;155),<sup><a href="#18442_1_target" name="18442_1">1</a></sup> and the amendments made by that Act.</p>
