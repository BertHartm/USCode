<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6901. Congressional findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Solid waste</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds with respect to solid waste&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the continuing technological progress and improvement in methods of manufacture, packaging, and marketing of consumer products has resulted in an ever-mounting increase, and in a change in the characteristics, of the mass material discarded by the purchaser of such products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the economic and population growth of our Nation, and the improvements in the standard of living enjoyed by our population, have required increased industrial production to meet our needs, and have made necessary the demolition of old buildings, the construction of new buildings, and the provision of highways and other avenues of transportation, which, together with related industrial, commercial, and agricultural operations, have resulted in a rising tide of scrap, discarded, and waste materials;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that the continuing concentration of our population in expanding metropolitan and other urban areas has presented these communities with serious financial, management, intergovernmental, and technical problems in the disposal of solid wastes resulting from the industrial, commercial, domestic, and other activities carried on in such areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that while the collection and disposal of solid wastes should continue to be primarily the function of State, regional, and local agencies, the problems of waste disposal as set forth above have become a matter national in scope and in concern and necessitate Federal action through financial and technical assistance and leadership in the development, demonstration, and application of new and improved methods and processes to reduce the amount of waste and unsalvageable materials and to provide for proper and economical solid waste disposal practices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Environment and health</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds with respect to the environment and health, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) although land is too valuable a national resource to be needlessly polluted by discarded materials, most solid waste is disposed of on land in open dumps and sanitary landfills;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) disposal of solid waste and hazardous waste in or on the land without careful planning and management can present a danger to human health and the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) as a result of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.], the Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.], and other Federal and State laws respecting public health and the environment, greater amounts of solid waste (in the form of sludge and other pollution treatment residues) have been created. Similarly, inadequate and environmentally unsound practices for the disposal or use of solid waste have created greater amounts of air and water pollution and other problems for the environment and for health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) open dumping is particularly harmful to health, contaminates drinking water from underground and surface supplies, and pollutes the air and the land;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the placement of inadequate controls on hazardous waste management will result in substantial risks to human health and the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) if hazardous waste management is improperly performed in the first instance, cor<!-- PDFPage:4444 -->rective action is likely to be expensive, complex, and time consuming;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) certain classes of land disposal facilities are not capable of assuring long-term containment of certain hazardous wastes, and to avoid substantial risk to human health and the environment, reliance on land disposal should be minimized or eliminated, and land disposal, particularly landfill and surface impoundment, should be the least favored method for managing hazardous wastes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) alternatives to existing methods of land disposal must be developed since many of the cities in the United States will be running out of suitable solid waste disposal sites within five years unless immediate action is taken.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds with respect to materials, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) millions of tons of recoverable material which could be used are needlessly buried each year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) methods are available to separate usable materials from solid waste; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the recovery and conservation of such materials can reduce the dependence of the United States on foreign resources and reduce the deficit in its balance of payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds with respect to energy, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) solid waste represents a potential source of solid fuel, oil, or gas that can be converted into energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the need exists to develop alternative energy sources for public and private consumption in order to reduce our dependence on such sources as petroleum products, natural gas, nuclear and hydroelectric generation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) technology exists to produce usable energy from solid waste.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The objectives of this chapter are to promote the protection of health and the environment and to conserve valuable material and energy resources by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) providing technical and financial assistance to State and local governments and interstate agencies for the development of solid waste management plans (including resource recovery and resource conservation systems) which will promote improved solid waste management techniques (including more effective organizational arrangements), new and improved methods of collection, separation, and recovery of solid waste, and the environmentally safe disposal of nonrecoverable residues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing training grants in occupations involving the design, operation, and maintenance of solid waste disposal systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) prohibiting future open dumping on the land and requiring the conversion of existing open dumps to facilities which do not pose a danger to the environment or to health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) assuring that hazardous waste management practices are conducted in a manner which protects human health and the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) requiring that hazardous waste be properly managed in the first instance thereby reducing the need for corrective action at a future date;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) minimizing the generation of hazardous waste and the land disposal of hazardous waste by encouraging process substitution, materials recovery, properly conducted recycling and reuse, and treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) establishing a viable Federal-State partnership to carry out the purposes of this chapter and insuring that the Administrator will, in carrying out the provisions of subchapter III of this chapter, give a high priority to assisting and cooperating with States in obtaining full authorization of State programs under subchapter III of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) providing for the promulgation of guidelines for solid waste collection, transport, separation, recovery, and disposal practices and systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) promoting a national research and development program for improved solid waste management and resource conservation techniques, more effective organizational arrangements, and new and improved methods of collection, separation, and recovery, and recycling of solid wastes and environmentally safe disposal of nonrecoverable residues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) promoting the demonstration, construction, and application of solid waste management, resource recovery, and resource conservation systems which preserve and enhance the quality of air, water, and land resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) establishing a cooperative effort among the Federal, State, and local governments and private enterprise in order to recover valuable materials and energy from solid waste.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) National policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby declares it to be the national policy of the United States that, wherever feasible, the generation of hazardous waste is to be reduced or eliminated as expeditiously as possible. Waste that is nevertheless generated should be treated, stored, or disposed of so as to minimize the present and future threat to human health and the environment.</p>
