<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the percentage determined under subparagraph (A) for a designated State for a fiscal year is less than 2 percent (including a negative percentage, in the case of a State for which there is no increase for purposes of such subparagraph), the percentage applicable under this paragraph for the State is 2 percent. If the percentage so determined is 2 percent or more, the percentage applicable under this paragraph for the State is the percentage determined under subparagraph (A), subject to not exceeding 5 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Requirement regarding rural areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A funding agreement for a grant under section 300x&ndash;21 of this title for a designated State is that, if the State will carry out 2 or more projects under paragraph (1), the State will carry out 1 such project in a rural area of the State, subject to subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall waive the requirement established in subparagraph (A) if the State involved certifies to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
