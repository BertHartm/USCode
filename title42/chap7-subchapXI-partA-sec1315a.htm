The purpose of the CMI is to test innovative payment and service delivery models to reduce program expenditures under the applicable subchapters while preserving or enhancing the quality of care furnished to individuals under such subchapters. In selecting such models, the Secretary shall give preference to models that also improve the coordination, quality, and efficiency of health care services furnished to applicable individuals defined in paragraph (4)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deadline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall ensure that the CMI is carrying out the duties described in this section by not later than January 1, 2011.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the duties under this section, the CMI shall consult representatives of relevant Federal agencies, and clinical and analytical experts with expertise in medicine and health care management.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Testing within certain geographic areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of testing payment and service delivery models under this section, the Secretary may elect to limit testing of a model to certain geographic areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Testing of models (phase I)</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The CMI shall test payment and service delivery models in accordance with selection criteria under paragraph (2) to determine the effect of applying such models under the applicable subchapter (as defined in subsection (a)(4)(B)) on program expenditures under such subchapters and the quality of care received by individuals receiving benefits under such subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Selection of models to be tested</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall select models to be tested from models where the Secretary determines that there is evidence that the model addresses a defined population for which there are deficits in care leading to poor clinical outcomes or potentially avoidable expenditures. The Secretary shall focus on models expected to reduce program costs under the applicable subchapter while preserving or enhancing the quality of care received by individuals receiving benefits under such subchapter. The models selected under this subparagraph may include, but are not limited to, the models described in subparagraph (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Whether the model provides for in-person contact with applicable individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Whether the model utilizes technology, such as electronic health records and patient-based remote monitoring systems, to coordinate care over time and across settings.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) Whether the model demonstrates effective linkage with other public sector or private sector payers.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Budget neutrality</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Initial period</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Termination or modification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall terminate or modify the design and implementation of a model unless the Secretary determines (and the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, with respect to program spending under the applicable subchapter, certifies), after testing has begun, that the model is expected to&mdash;</p>
