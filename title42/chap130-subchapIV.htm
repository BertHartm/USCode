<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Financing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The application shall identify and describe the proposed financing for (A) any rehabilitation, and (B) acquisition (i) of the project, where applicable, by an entity for transfer to eligible families, and (ii) by eligible families of ownership interests in, or shares representing, units in the project.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Property transferred under this part shall not be pledged as collateral for debt or otherwise encumbered except when the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the proceeds of such encumbrance will be used only to meet housing standards in accordance with subsection (f) of this section or to make such additional capital improvements as the Secretary determines to be consistent with the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Opportunity to cure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any lender that provides financing in connection with a homeownership program under <!-- PDFPage:6119 -->this part shall give the public housing agency, resident management corporation, individual owner, or other appropriate entity a reasonable opportunity to cure a financial default before foreclosing on the property, or taking other action as a result of the default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Housing quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The application shall include a plan ensuring that the unit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be free from any defects that pose a danger to health or safety before transfer of an ownership interest in, or shares representing, a unit to an eligible family; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will, not later than 2 years after the transfer to an eligible family, meet minimum housing standards established by the Secretary for the purpose of this title.<sup><a href="#12874_1_target" name="12874_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">No tenant residing in a dwelling unit in a property on the date the Secretary approves an application for an implementation grant may be evicted by reason of a homeownership program approved under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a tenant decides not to purchase a unit, or is not qualified to do so, the Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, ensure that rental assistance under section 1437f of this title is available for use by each otherwise qualified tenant in that or another property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relocation assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The recipient shall also inform each such tenant that if the tenant chooses to move, the recipient will pay relocation assistance in accordance with the approved homeownership program.</p>
