<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;505, title IV, subtitle B, Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2340, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 411. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This subtitle may be cited as the &lsquo;Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Rural AED Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 412. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The American Heart Association estimates that 250,000 Americans die from sudden cardiac arrest each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A cardiac arrest victim's chance of survival drops 10 percent for every minute that passes before his or her heart is returned to normal rhythm.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because most cardiac arrest victims are initially in ventricular fibrillation, and the only treatment for ventricular fibrillation is defibrillation, prompt access to defibrillation to return the heart to normal rhythm is essential.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Lifesaving technology, the automated external defibrillator, has been developed to allow trained lay rescuers to respond to cardiac arrest by using this simple device to shock the heart into normal rhythm.</p>

If there are no health facilities in or serving such area, the Secretary may arrange to have Corps members provide health services in the nearest health facilities of the Service or may lease or otherwise provide facilities in or serving such area for the provision of health services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the individuals in or served by a health professional shortage area are being served (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) by a hospital or other health care delivery facility of the Service, the Secretary may, in addition to such other arrangements as he may make under paragraph (1), arrange for the utilization of such hospital or facility by Corps members in providing health services, but only to the extent that such utilization will not impair the delivery of health services and treatment through such hospital or facility to individuals who are entitled to health services and treatment through such hospital or facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) It shall be unlawful for any hospital to deny an authorized Corps member admitting privileges when such Corps member otherwise meets the professional qualifications established by the hospital for granting such privileges and agrees to abide by the published bylaws of the hospital and the published bylaws, rules, and regulations of its medical staff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any hospital which is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record, to have violated this subsection shall upon such finding cease, for a period to be determined by the Secretary, to receive and to be eligible to receive any Federal funds under this chapter or under titles XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq., 1397aa et seq.].</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute a national average per resident amount equal to the average of the standardized per resident amounts computed under subparagraph (C) for such hospitals, with the amount for each hospital weighted by the average number of full-time equivalent residents at such hospital.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Application to individual hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute for each such hospital that is a children's hospital a per resident amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by dividing the national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (D) into a wage-related portion and a non-wage-related portion by applying the proportion determined under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by multiplying the wage-related portion by the factor described in subparagraph (C)(ii) for the hospital's area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Updating rate</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account variations in case mix among children's hospitals and the ratio of the number of full-time equivalent residents in the hospitals&rsquo; approved graduate medical residency training programs to beds (but excluding beds or bassinets assigned to healthy newborn infants); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) assure that the aggregate of the payments for indirect expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill patients and the additional costs related to the teaching of residents under this section in a fiscal year are equal to the amount appropriated for such expenses for the fiscal year involved under subsection (f)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Making of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Interim payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall determine, before the beginning of each fiscal year involved for which payments may be made for a hospital under this section, the amounts of the payments for direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education for such fiscal year and shall (subject to paragraph (2)) make the payments of such amounts in 26 equal interim installments during such period. Such interim payments to each individual hospital shall be based on the number of residents reported in the hospital's most recently filed Medicare cost report prior to the application date for the Federal fiscal year for which the interim payment amounts are established. In the case of a hospital that does not report residents on a Medicare cost report, such interim payments shall be based on the number of residents trained during the hospital's most recently completed Medicare cost report filing period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall withhold up to 25 percent from each interim installment for direct and indirect graduate medical education paid under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall withhold up to 25 percent from each interim installment for direct and indirect graduate medical education paid under paragraph (1) as necessary to ensure a hospital will not be overpaid on an interim basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reconciliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Prior to the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine any changes to the number of residents reported by a hospital in the application of the hospital for the current fiscal year to determine the final amount payable to the hospital for the current fiscal year for both direct expense and indirect expense amounts. Based on such determination, the Secretary shall recoup any overpayments <!-- PDFPage:345 -->made to pay any balance due to the extent possible. The final amount so determined shall be considered a final intermediary determination for the purposes of section 1395<em>oo</em> of this title and shall be subject to administrative and judicial review under that section in the same manner as the amount of payment under section 1395ww(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#256e_1_target" name="256e_1">1</a></sup> of this title is subject to review under such section.</p>
