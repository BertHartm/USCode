<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that the Secretary grants a waiver under paragraph (1) or (2), and does not, pursuant to paragraph (5), require payment by the entity in the amount described in subsection (f)(1) of this section, the entity shall be required to use the total amount of funds collected by such entity in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section for the improvement of the capability of such entity to deliver health services to the individuals in, or served by, the health professional shortage area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In determining whether to grant a waiver under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary shall not discriminate against a public entity.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Small health centers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An entity which is a small health center shall pay to the United States, as prescribed by <!-- PDFPage:210 -->the Secretary in each calendar quarter (or other period as may be specified in the agreement) during which any Corps member is assigned to such entity, an amount equal to the amount (prorated for a calendar quarter or other period) by which the revenues that the center may reasonably expect to receive during an annual period for the provision of health services exceeds the costs that the center may reasonably expect to incur in the provision of such services, except that the amount that an entity shall pay to the United States under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount such entity would pay to the United States under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section if such paragraph applied to such entity.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The revenues and costs determined by the Secretary shall be the revenues and costs used in making the determination under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A determination under subparagraph (B) regarding the revenues and costs of an entity in an annual period shall be made by the Secretary utilizing criteria specific to the entity and shall be made without regard to whether the entity is making progress toward collecting sufficient revenues to provide an adequate level of primary health services without the assignment of Corps members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In making a determination referred to in clause (i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Secretary may consider whether the proposed budget submitted under subparagraph (A) provides a reasonable estimate regarding the revenues and costs of the entity; and</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;254h. Provision of health services by Corps members</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Means of delivery of services; cooperation with other health care providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing health services in a health professional shortage area, Corps members shall utilize the techniques, facilities, and organizational forms most appropriate for the area, population group, medical facility, or other public facility, and shall, to the maximum extent feasible, provide such services (1) to all individuals in, or served by, such health professional shortage area regardless of their ability to pay for the services, and (2) in a manner which is cooperative with other health care providers serving such health professional shortage area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Utilization of existing health facilities; lease, acquisition, and use of equipment and supplies; permanent and temporary professional services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may (A) to the maximum extent feasible make such arrangements as he determines necessary to enable Corps members to utilize the health facilities in or serving the health professional shortage area in providing health services; (B) make such arrangements as he determines are necessary for the use of equipment and supplies of the Service and for the lease or acquisition of other equipment and supplies; and (C) secure the permanent or temporary services of physicians, dentists, nurses, administrators, and other health personnel. If there are no health facilities in or serving such area, the Secretary may arrange to have Corps members provide health services in the nearest health facilities of the Service or may lease or otherwise provide facilities in or serving such area for the provision of health services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the individuals in or served by a health professional shortage area are being served (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) by a hospital or other health care delivery facility of the Service, the Secretary may, in addition to such other arrangements as he may make under paragraph (1), arrange for the utilization of such hospital or facility by Corps members in providing health services, but only to the extent that such utilization will not impair the delivery of health services and treatment through such hospital or facility to individuals who are entitled to health services and treatment through such hospital or facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loan; purposes; limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make one loan to any entity with an approved application under section 254f of this title to assist such entity in meeting the costs of (1) establishing medical, dental, or other health profession practices, including the development of medical practice management systems; (2) acquiring equipment for use in pro<!-- PDFPage:212 -->viding health services; and (3) renovating buildings to establish health facilities. No loan may be made under this subsection unless an application therefor is submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary. The amount of any such loan shall be determined by the Secretary, except that no such loan may exceed $50,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Property and equipment disposal; fair market value; sale at less than full market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the expiration of the assignment of all Corps members to a health professional shortage area, the Secretary may (notwithstanding any other provision of law) sell, to any appropriate local entity, equipment and other property of the United States utilized by such members in providing health services. Sales made under this subsection shall be made at the fair market value (as determined by the Secretary) of the equipment or such other property; except that the Secretary may make such sales for a lesser value to an appropriate local entity, if he determines that the entity is financially unable to pay the full market value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Admitting privileges denied to Corps member by hospital; notice and hearing; denial of Federal funds for violation; &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) It shall be unlawful for any hospital to deny an authorized Corps member admitting privileges when such Corps member otherwise meets the professional qualifications established by the hospital for granting such privileges and agrees to abide by the published bylaws of the hospital and the published bylaws, rules, and regulations of its medical staff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any hospital which is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record, to have violated this subsection shall upon such finding cease, for a period to be determined by the Secretary, to receive and to be eligible to receive any Federal funds under this chapter or under titles XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; includes a State or local public hospital, a private profit hospital, a private nonprofit hospital, a general or special hospital, and any other type of hospital (excluding a hospital owned or operated by an agency of the Federal Government), and any related facilities.</p>
