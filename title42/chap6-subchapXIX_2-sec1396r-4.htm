<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Implementation of requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A State plan under this subchapter shall not be considered to meet the requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs), as of July 1, 1988, unless the State has submitted to the Secretary, by not later than such date, an amendment to such plan that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specifically defines the hospitals so described (and includes in such definition any disproportionate share hospital described in subsection (b)(1) of this section which meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this section), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provides, effective for inpatient hospital services provided not later than July 1, 1988, for an appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment for such services provided by such hospitals, consistent with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, 1989, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1989, the State plan amendment described in paragraph (1), consistent with subsection (c) of this section, effective for inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1989.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In order to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, 1990, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1990, the State plan amendment described in paragraph (1), consistent with subsections (c) and (f) of this section, effective for inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a State plan under this subchapter provides for payments for inpatient hospital services on a prospective basis (whether per diem, per case, or otherwise), in order for the plan to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, 1989, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1989, a State plan amendment that provides, in the case of hospitals defined by the State as disproportionate share hospitals under paragraph (1)(A), for an outlier adjustment in payment amounts for medically necessary inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1989, involving exceptionally high costs or exceptionally long lengths of stay for individuals under one year of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall, not later than 90 days after the date a State submits an amendment under this subsection, review each such amendment for compliance with such requirement and by such date shall approve or disapprove each such amendment. If the Secretary disapproves such an amendment, the State shall immediately submit a revised amendment which meets such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The requirement of this subsection may not be waived under section 1396n(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hospitals deemed disproportionate share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(1) of this section, a hospital which meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this section is deemed to be a disproportionate share hospital if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the hospital's medicaid inpatient utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (2)) is at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the hospital's low-income utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (3)) exceeds 25 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the term &ldquo;medicaid inpatient utilization rate&rdquo; means, for a hospital, a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the hospital's number of inpatient days attributable to patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter in a period, and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital's inpatient days in that period. In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;inpatient day&rdquo; includes each day in which an individual (including a newborn) is an inpatient in the hospital, whether or not the individual is in a specialized ward <!-- PDFPage:2103 -->and whether or not the individual remains in the hospital for lack of suitable placement elsewhere.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term &ldquo;low-income utilization rate&rdquo; means, for a hospital, the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the fraction (expressed as a percentage)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the sum (for a period) of (I) the total revenues paid the hospital for patient services under a State plan under this subchapter and (II) the amount of the cash subsidies for patient services received directly from State and local governments, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the total amount of revenues of the hospital for patient services (including the amount of such cash subsidies) in the period; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction (expressed as a percentage)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospital services which are attributable to charity care in a period, less the portion of any cash subsidies described in clause (i)(II) of subparagraph (A) in the period reasonably attributable to inpatient hospital services, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospital services in the hospital in the period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The numerator under subparagraph (B)(i) shall not include contractual allowances and discounts (other than for indigent patients not eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not restrict a State's authority to designate hospitals as disproportionate share hospitals under this section. The previous sentence shall not be construed to affect the authority of the Secretary to reduce payments pursuant to section 1396b(w)(1)(A)(iii) of this title if the Secretary determines that, as a result of such designations, there is in effect a hold harmless provision described in section 1396b(w)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, in order to be consistent with this subsection, a payment adjustment for a disproportionate share hospital must either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be in an amount equal to at least the product of (A) the amount paid under the State plan to the hospital for operating costs for inpatient hospital services (of the kind described in section 1395ww(a)(4) of this title), and (B) the hospital's disproportionate share adjustment percentage (established under section 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(iv) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for a minimum specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) and (without regard to whether the hospital is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section) for an increase in such a payment amount (or percentage payment) in proportion to the percentage by which the hospital's medicaid utilization rate (as defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section) exceeds one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the State or the hospital's low-income utilization rate (as defined in paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396r-4_1_target" name="1396r-4_1">1</a></sup> (b)(3) of this section); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide for a minimum specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) that varies according to type of hospital under a methodology that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) applies equally to all hospitals of each type; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) results in an adjustment for each type of hospital that is reasonably related to the costs, volume, or proportion of services provided to patients eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter or to low-income patients.<sup><a href="#1396r-4_2_target" name="1396r-4_2">2</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that, for purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(A) of subsection (a) of this section, the payment adjustment for a disproportionate share hospital is consistent with this subsection if the appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment is equal to at least one-third of the increase otherwise applicable under this subsection (in the case of such paragraph (1)(B)) and at least two-thirds of such increase (in the case of paragraph (2)(A)). In the case of a hospital described in subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) of this section (relating to children's hospitals), in computing the hospital's disproportionate share adjustment percentage for purposes of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the disproportionate patient percentage (defined in section 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi) of this title) shall be computed by substituting for the fraction described in subclause (I) of such section the fraction described in subclause (II) of that section. If a State elects in a State plan amendment under subsection (a) of this section to provide the payment adjustment described in paragraph (2), the State must include in the amendment a detailed description of the specific methodology to be used in determining the specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) to be made to each hospital qualifying for such a payment adjustment and must publish at least annually the name of each hospital qualifying for such a payment adjustment and the amount of such payment adjustment made for each such hospital.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirements to qualify as disproportionate share hospital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no hospital may be defined or deemed as a disproportionate share hospital under a State plan under this subchapter or under subsection (b) of this section unless the hospital has at least 2 obstetricians who have staff privileges at the hospital and who have agreed to provide obstetric services to individuals who are entitled to medical assistance for such services under such State plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a hospital&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the inpatients of which are predominantly individuals under 18 years of age; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2104 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) which does not offer nonemergency obstetric services to the general population as of December 22, 1987.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a hospital located in a rural area (as defined for purposes of section 1395ww of this title), in paragraph (1) the term &ldquo;obstetrician&rdquo; includes any physician with staff privileges at the hospital to perform nonemergency obstetric procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No hospital may be defined or deemed as a disproportionate share hospital under a State plan under this subchapter or under subsection (b) or (e) of this section unless the hospital has a medicaid inpatient utilization rate (as defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section) of not less than 1 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A State plan shall be considered to meet the requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs) without regard to the requirement of subsection (a) of this section if (A)(i) the plan provided for payment adjustments based on a pooling arrangement involving a majority of the hospitals participating under the plan for disproportionate share hospitals as of January 1, 1984, or (ii) the plan as of January 1, 1987, provided for payment adjustments based on a statewide pooling arrangement involving all acute care hospitals and the arrangement provides for reimbursement of the total amount of uncompensated care provided by each participating hospital, (B) the aggregate amount of the payment adjustments under the plan for such hospitals is not less than the aggregate amount of such adjustments otherwise required to be made under such subsection, and (C) the plan meets the requirement of subsection (d)(3) of this section and such payment adjustments are made consistent with the last sentence of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a State that used a health insuring organization before January 1, 1986, to administer a portion of its plan on a statewide basis, beginning on July 1, 1988&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section (other than the last sentence of subsection (c) of this section) shall not apply if the aggregate amount of the payment adjustments under the plan for disproportionate share hospitals (as defined under the State plan) is not less than the aggregate amount of payment adjustments otherwise required to be made if such subsections applied,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subsection (d)(2)(B) of this section shall apply to hospitals located in urban areas, as well as in rural areas,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) subsection (d)(3) of this section shall apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) subsection (g) of this section shall apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in fiscal year 1992 (beginning on or after January 1, 1992), unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-5em">(b) in accordance with the State plan in effect or amendments submitted to the Secretary by November 26, 1991, or modification thereof, if the amendment designates only disproportionate share hospitals with a medicaid or low-income utilization percentage at or above the Statewide&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396r-4_3_target" name="1396r-4_3">3</a></sup> arithmetic mean, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(c) in accordance with a payment methodology which was established and in effect as of September 30, 1991, or in accordance with legislation or regulations enacted or adopted as of such date; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the payment adjustments are the minimum adjustments required in order to meet the requirements of subsection (c)(1) of this section; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in a subsequent fiscal year, to the extent that the total of such payment adjustments exceeds the State disproportionate share hospital (in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;DSH&rdquo;) allotment for the year (as specified in paragraph (2)).</p>
