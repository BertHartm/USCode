<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that as more countries acquire the capability for launching payloads into outer space, there is an increasing need for a framework under which information intended to promote safe access into outer space, operations in outer space, and return from outer space to Earth free from physical or radio-frequency interference can be shared among those countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Discussions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall, in consultation with such other agencies of the Federal Government as the Administrator considers appropriate, initiate discussions with the appropriate representatives of other space-faring countries to determine an appropriate frame-work&nbsp;<sup><a href="#17821_1_target" name="17821_1">1</a></sup> under which information intended to promote safe access into outer space, operations in outer space, and return from outer space to Earth free from physical or radio-frequency interference can be shared among those nations.</p>
