<p class="statutory-body-1em">The methodology developed under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determine the method for measuring, monitoring, and quantifying covered greenhouse gas emissions and reductions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) estimate the total capacity of each ecosystem to sequester carbon; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) estimate the ability of each ecosystem to reduce emissions of covered greenhouse gases through management practices; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may employ economic and other systems models, analyses, and estimates, to be developed in consultation with each of the individuals described in subsection (e).</p>
