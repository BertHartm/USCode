<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National primary drinking water regulations; maximum contaminant level goals; simultaneous publication of regulations and goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Effective on June 19, 1986, each national interim or revised primary drinking water regulation promulgated under this section before June 19, 1986, shall be deemed to be a national primary drinking water regulation under subsection (b) of this section. No such regulation shall be required to comply with the standards set forth in subsection (b)(4) of this section unless such regulation is amended to establish a different maximum contaminant level after June 19, 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After June 19, 1986, each recommended maximum contaminant level published before June 19, 1986, shall be treated as a maximum contaminant level goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a national primary drinking water regulation is proposed under subsection (b) of this section for any contaminant, the maximum contaminant level goal for such contaminant shall be proposed simultaneously. Whenever a national primary drinking water regulation is promulgated under subsection (b) of this section for any contaminant, the maximum contaminant level goal for such contaminant shall be published simultaneously.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (3) shall not apply to any recommended maximum contaminant level published before June 19, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>Identification of contaminants for listing.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>General authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall, in accordance with the procedures established by this subsection, publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant (other than a contaminant referred to in paragraph (2) for which a national primary drinking water regulation has been promulgated as of August 6, 1996) if the Administrator determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the contaminant may have an adverse effect on the health of persons;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:634 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the contaminant is known to occur or there is a substantial likelihood that the contaminant will occur in public water systems with a frequency and at levels of public health concern; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the sole judgment of the Administrator, regulation of such contaminant presents a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Regulation of unregulated contaminants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Listing of contaminants for consideration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(I) Not later than 18 months after August 6, 1996, and every 5 years thereafter, the Administrator, after consultation with the scientific community, including the Science Advisory Board, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and after considering the occurrence data base established under section 300j&ndash;4(g) of this title, shall publish a list of contaminants which, at the time of publication, are not subject to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking water regulation, which are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems, and which may require regulation under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The unregulated contaminants considered under subclause (I) shall include, but not be limited to, substances referred to in section 9601(14) of this title, and substances registered as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) The Administrator's decision whether or not to select an unregulated contaminant for a list under this clause shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Determination to regulate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(I) Not later than 5 years after August 6, 1996, and every 5 years thereafter, the Administrator shall, after notice of the preliminary determination and opportunity for public comment, for not fewer than 5 contaminants included on the list published under clause (i), make determinations of whether or not to regulate such contaminants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) A determination to regulate a contaminant shall be based on findings that the criteria of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A) are satisfied. Such findings shall be based on the best available public health information, including the occurrence data base established under section 300j&ndash;4(g) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) The Administrator may make a determination to regulate a contaminant that does not appear on a list under clause (i) if the determination to regulate is made pursuant to subclause (II).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) A determination under this clause not to regulate a contaminant shall be considered final agency action and subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each document setting forth the determination for a contaminant under clause (ii) shall be available for public comment at such time as the determination is published.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Priorities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting unregulated contaminants for consideration under subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall select contaminants that present the greatest public health concern. The Administrator, in making such selection, shall take into consideration, among other factors of public health concern, the effect of such contaminants upon subgroups that comprise a meaningful portion of the general population (such as infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, or other subpopulations) that are identifiable as being at greater risk of adverse health effects due to exposure to contaminants in drinking water than the general population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Urgent threats to public health</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may promulgate an interim national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant without making a determination for the contaminant under paragraph (4)(C), or completing the analysis under paragraph (3)(C), to address an urgent threat to public health as determined by the Administrator after consultation with and written response to any comments provided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the director of the National Institutes of Health. A determination for any contaminant in accordance with paragraph (4)(C) subject to an interim regulation under this subparagraph shall be issued, and a completed analysis meeting the requirements of paragraph (3)(C) shall be published, not later than 3 years after the date on which the regulation is promulgated and the regulation shall be repromulgated, or revised if appropriate, not later than 5 years after that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For each contaminant that the Administrator determines to regulate under subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall publish maximum contaminant level goals and promulgate, by rule, national primary drinking water regulations under this subsection. The Administrator shall propose the maximum contaminant level goal and national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant not later than 24 months after the determination to regulate under subparagraph (B), and may publish such proposed regulation concurrent with the determination to regulate. The Administrator shall publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation within 18 months after the proposal thereof. The Administrator, by notice in the Federal Register, may extend the deadline for such promulgation for up to 9 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Health advisories and other actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may publish health advisories (which are not regulations) or take other appropriate actions for contaminants not subject to any national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Schedules and deadlines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of the contaminants listed in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in volume 47, Federal Register, page 9352, and in volume 48, Federal Register, page 45502, the Administrator shall <!-- PDFPage:635 -->publish maximum contaminant level goals and promulgate national primary drinking water regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) not later than 1 year after June 19, 1986, for not fewer than 9 of the listed contaminants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not later than 2 years after June 19, 1986, for not fewer than 40 of the listed contaminants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) not later than 3 years after June 19, 1986, for the remainder of the listed contaminants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Substitution of contaminants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator identifies a drinking water contaminant the regulation of which, in the judgment of the Administrator, is more likely to be protective of public health (taking into account the schedule for regulation under subparagraph (A)) than a contaminant referred to in subparagraph (A), the Administrator may publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for the identified contaminant in lieu of regulating the contaminant referred to in subparagraph (A). Substitutions may be made for not more than 7 contaminants referred to in subparagraph (A). Regulation of a contaminant identified under this subparagraph shall be in accordance with the schedule applicable to the contaminant for which the substitution is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Disinfectants and disinfection byproducts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall promulgate an Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, a Final Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, a Stage I Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule, and a Stage II Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule in accordance with the schedule published in volume 59, Federal Register, page 6361 (February 10, 1994), in table III.13 of the proposed Information Collection Rule. If a delay occurs with respect to the promulgation of any rule in the schedule referred to in this subparagraph, all subsequent rules shall be completed as expeditiously as practicable but no later than a revised date that reflects the interval or intervals for the rules in the schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Risk assessment, management, and communication.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Use of science in decisionmaking</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, and, to the degree that an Agency action is based on science, the Administrator shall use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the best available, peer-reviewed science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) data collected by accepted methods or best available methods (if the reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justifies use of the data).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Public information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Administrator shall ensure that the presentation of information on public health effects is comprehensive, informative, and understandable. The Administrator shall, in a document made available to the public in support of a regulation promulgated under this section, specify, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) each population addressed by any estimate of public health effects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the expected risk or central estimate of risk for the specific populations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) each appropriate upper-bound or lower-bound estimate of risk;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) each significant uncertainty identified in the process of the assessment of public health effects and studies that would assist in resolving the uncertainty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) peer-reviewed studies known to the Administrator that support, are directly relevant to, or fail to support any estimate of public health effects and the methodology used to reconcile inconsistencies in the scientific data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Health risk reduction and cost analysis.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Maximum contaminant levels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When proposing any national primary drinking water regulation that includes a maximum contaminant level, the Administrator shall, with respect to a maximum contaminant level that is being considered in accordance with paragraph (4) and each alternative maximum contaminant level that is being considered pursuant to paragraph (5) or (6)(A), publish, seek public comment on, and use for the purposes of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) an analysis of each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) Quantifiable and nonquantifiable health risk reduction benefits for which there is a factual basis in the rulemaking record to conclude that such benefits are likely to occur as the result of treatment to comply with each level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) Quantifiable and nonquantifiable health risk reduction benefits for which there is a factual basis in the rulemaking record to conclude that such benefits are likely to occur from reductions in co-occurring contaminants that may be attributed solely to compliance with the maximum contaminant level, excluding benefits resulting from compliance with other proposed or promulgated regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Quantifiable and nonquantifiable costs for which there is a factual basis in the rulemaking record to conclude that such costs are likely to occur solely as a result of compliance with the maximum contaminant level, including monitoring, treatment, and other costs and excluding costs resulting from compliance with other proposed or promulgated regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) The incremental costs and benefits associated with each alternative maximum contaminant level considered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(V) The effects of the contaminant on the general population and on groups within the general population such as infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, or other subpopulations that are identified as likely to be at greater risk of adverse health effects due to exposure to contaminants in drinking water than the general population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(VI) Any increased health risk that may occur as the result of compliance, includ<!-- PDFPage:636 -->ing risks associated with co-occurring contaminants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(VII) Other relevant factors, including the quality and extent of the information, the uncertainties in the analysis supporting subclauses (I) through (VI), and factors with respect to the degree and nature of the risk.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Treatment techniques</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When proposing a national primary drinking water regulation that includes a treatment technique in accordance with paragraph (7)(A), the Administrator shall publish and seek public comment on an analysis of the health risk reduction benefits and costs likely to be experienced as the result of compliance with the treatment technique and alternative treatment techniques that are being considered, taking into account, as appropriate, the factors described in clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Approaches to measure and value benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may identify valid approaches for the measurement and valuation of benefits under this subparagraph, including approaches to identify consumer willingness to pay for reductions in health risks from drinking water contaminants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There are authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator, acting through the Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water, to conduct studies, assessments, and analyses in support of regulations or the development of methods, $35,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1996 through 2003.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Goals and standards.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Maximum contaminant level goals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each maximum contaminant level goal established under this subsection shall be set at the level at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Maximum contaminant levels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6), each national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant for which a maximum contaminant level goal is established under this subsection shall specify a maximum contaminant level for such contaminant which is as close to the maximum contaminant level goal as is feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the time the Administrator proposes a national primary drinking water regulation under this paragraph, the Administrator shall publish a determination as to whether the benefits of the maximum contaminant level justify, or do not justify, the costs based on the analysis conducted under paragraph (3)(C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Definition of feasible</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;feasible&rdquo; means feasible with the use of the best technology, treatment techniques and other means which the Administrator finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely under laboratory conditions, are available (taking cost into consideration). For the purpose of this paragraph, granular activated carbon is feasible for the control of synthetic organic chemicals, and any technology, treatment technique, or other means found to be the best available for the control of synthetic organic chemicals must be at least as effective in controlling synthetic organic chemicals as granular activated carbon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Feasible technologies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each national primary drinking water regulation which establishes a maximum contaminant level shall list the technology, treatment techniques, and other means which the Administrator finds to be feasible for purposes of meeting such maximum contaminant level, but a regulation under this subsection shall not require that any specified technology, treatment technique, or other means be used for purposes of meeting such maximum contaminant level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>List of technologies for small systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall include in the list any technology, treatment technique, or other means that is affordable, as determined by the Administrator in consultation with the States, for small public water systems serving&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) a population of 10,000 or fewer but more than 3,300;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a population of 3,300 or fewer but more than 500; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a population of 500 or fewer but more than 25;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and that achieves compliance with the maximum contaminant level or treatment technique, including packaged or modular systems and point-of-entry or point-of-use treatment units. Point-of-entry and point-of-use treatment units shall be owned, controlled and maintained by the public water system or by a person under contract with the public water system to ensure proper operation and maintenance and compliance with the maximum contaminant level or treatment technique and equipped with mechanical warnings to ensure that customers are automatically notified of operational problems. The Administrator shall not include in the list any point-of-use treatment technology, treatment technique, or other means to achieve compliance with a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique requirement for a microbial contaminant (or an indicator of a microbial contaminant). If the American National Standards Institute has issued product standards applicable to a specific type of point-of-entry or point-of-use treatment unit, individual units of that type shall not be accepted for compliance with a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique requirement unless they are independently certified in accordance with such standards. In listing any technology, treatment technique, or other means pursuant to this clause, the Administrator shall consider the quality of the source water to be treated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>List of technologies that achieve compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in clause (v), not later than 2 years after August 6, 1996, and after consultation with the States, the Administrator shall issue a list of tech<!-- PDFPage:637 -->nologies that achieve compliance with the maximum contaminant level or treatment technique for each category of public water systems described in subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (ii) for each national primary drinking water regulation promulgated prior to June 19, 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Additional technologies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may, at any time after a national primary drinking water regulation has been promulgated, supplement the list of technologies describing additional or new or innovative treatment technologies that meet the requirements of this paragraph for categories of small public water systems described in subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (ii) that are subject to the regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) <cap-smallcap>Technologies that meet surface water treatment rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within one year after August 6, 1996, the Administrator shall list technologies that meet the Surface Water Treatment Rule for each category of public water systems described in subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (ii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Additional health risk considerations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (4), the Administrator may establish a maximum contaminant level for a contaminant at a level other than the feasible level, if the technology, treatment techniques, and other means used to determine the feasible level would result in an increase in the health risk from drinking water by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) increasing the concentration of other contaminants in drinking water; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) interfering with the efficacy of drinking water treatment techniques or processes that are used to comply with other national primary drinking water regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of level</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator establishes a maximum contaminant level or levels or requires the use of treatment techniques for any contaminant or contaminants pursuant to the authority of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the level or levels or treatment techniques shall minimize the overall risk of adverse health effects by balancing the risk from the contaminant and the risk from other contaminants the concentrations of which may be affected by the use of a treatment technique or process that would be employed to attain the maximum contaminant level or levels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the combination of technology, treatment techniques, or other means required to meet the level or levels shall not be more stringent than is feasible (as defined in paragraph (4)(D)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Additional health risk reduction and cost considerations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (4), if the Administrator determines based on an analysis conducted under paragraph (3)(C) that the benefits of a maximum contaminant level promulgated in accordance with paragraph (4) would not justify the costs of complying with the level, the Administrator may, after notice and opportunity for public comment, promulgate a maximum contaminant level for the contaminant that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost that is justified by the benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall not use the authority of this paragraph to promulgate a maximum contaminant level for a contaminant, if the benefits of compliance with a national primary drinking water regulation for the contaminant that would be promulgated in accordance with paragraph (4) experienced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) persons served by large public water systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) persons served by such other systems as are unlikely, based on information provided by the States, to receive a variance under section 300g&ndash;4(e) of this title (relating to small system variances);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">would justify the costs to the systems of complying with the regulation. This subparagraph shall not apply if the contaminant is found almost exclusively in small systems eligible under section 300g&ndash;4(e) of this title for a small system variance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Disinfectants and disinfection byproducts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not use the authority of this paragraph to establish a maximum contaminant level in a Stage I or Stage II national primary drinking water regulation (as described in paragraph (2)(C)) for contaminants that are disinfectants or disinfection byproducts, or to establish a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique requirement for the control of cryptosporidium. The authority of this paragraph may be used to establish regulations for the use of disinfection by systems relying on ground water sources as required by paragraph (8).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Judicial review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A determination by the Administrator that the benefits of a maximum contaminant level or treatment requirement justify or do not justify the costs of complying with the level shall be reviewed by the court pursuant to section 300j&ndash;7 of this title only as part of a review of a final national primary drinking water regulation that has been promulgated based on the determination and shall not be set aside by the court under that section unless the court finds that the determination is arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The Administrator is authorized to promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation that requires the use of a treatment technique in lieu of establishing a maximum contaminant level, if the Administrator makes a finding that it is not economically or technologically feasible to ascertain the level of the contaminant. In such case, the Administrator shall identify those treatment techniques which, in the Administrator's judgment, would prevent known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons to the extent feasible. Such regulations shall specify each treatment technique known to the Administrator which meets the requirements of this paragraph, but the Administrator may grant a variance from any specified treatment technique in accordance with section 300g&ndash;4(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any schedule referred to in this subsection for the promulgation of a national primary <!-- PDFPage:638 -->drinking water regulation for any contaminant shall apply in the same manner if the regulation requires a treatment technique in lieu of establishing a maximum contaminant level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Not later than 18 months after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall propose and promulgate national primary drinking water regulations specifying criteria under which filtration (including coagulation and sedimentation, as appropriate) is required as a treatment technique for public water systems supplied by surface water sources. In promulgating such rules, the Administrator shall consider the quality of source waters, protection afforded by watershed management, treatment practices (such as disinfection and length of water storage) and other factors relevant to protection of health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In lieu of the provisions of section 300g&ndash;4 of this title the Administrator shall specify procedures by which the State determines which public water systems within its jurisdiction shall adopt filtration under the criteria of clause (i). The State may require the public water system to provide studies or other information to assist in this determination. The procedures shall provide notice and opportunity for public hearing on this determination. If the State determines that filtration is required, the State shall prescribe a schedule for compliance by the public water system with the filtration requirement. A schedule shall require compliance within 18 months of a determination made under clause (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Within 18 months from the time that the Administrator establishes the criteria and procedures under this subparagraph, a State with primary enforcement responsibility shall adopt any necessary regulations to implement this subparagraph. Within 12 months of adoption of such regulations the State shall make determinations regarding filtration for all the public water systems within its jurisdiction supplied by surface waters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If a State does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems, the Administrator shall have the same authority to make the determination in clause (ii) in such State as the State would have under that clause. Any filtration requirement or schedule under this subparagraph shall be treated as if it were a requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) As an additional alternative to the regulations promulgated pursuant to clauses (i) and (iii), including the criteria for avoiding filtration contained in 40 CFR 141.71, a State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems may, on a case-by-case basis, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, establish treatment requirements as an alternative to filtration in the case of systems having uninhabited, undeveloped watersheds in consolidated ownership, and having control over access to, and activities in, those watersheds, if the State determines (and the Administrator concurs) that the quality of the source water and the alternative treatment requirements established by the State ensure greater removal or inactivation efficiencies of pathogenic organisms for which national primary drinking water regulations have been promulgated or that are of public health concern than would be achieved by the combination of filtration and chlorine disinfection (in compliance with this section).</p>
