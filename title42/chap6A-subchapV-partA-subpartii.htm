<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the amount of the loan may, in the case of the third or fourth year of a student at a school of medicine or osteopathic medicine, be increased to the extent necessary to pay the balances of loans that, from sources other than the student loan fund under section 292q of this title, were made to the individual for attendance at the school. The authority to make such an increase is subject to the school and the student agreeing that such amount (as increased) will be expended to pay such balances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 292s of this title, any such loans shall be made on such terms and conditions as the school may determine, but may be made only to a student&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Security or endorsement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans shall be made under this subpart without security or endorsement, except that if the borrower is a minor and the note or other evidence of obligation executed by him would not, under the applicable law, create a binding obligation, either security or endorsement may be required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transferring and assigning loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No note or other evidence of a loan made under this subpart may be transferred or assigned by the school making the loan except that, if the borrowers transfer to another school participating in the program under this subpart, such note or other evidence of a loan may be transferred to such other school.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Charge with respect to insurance for certain cancellations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to regulations of the Secretary, a school may assess a charge with respect to loans made this subpart&nbsp;<sup><a href="#292r_1_target" name="292r_1">1</a></sup> to cover the costs of insuring against cancellation of liability under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Charge with respect to late payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to regulations of the Secretary, and in accordance with this section, a school shall assess a charge with respect to a loan made under this subpart for failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when it is due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment of the loan under subsection (c) of this section, for any failure to file timely and satisfactory evidence of such entitlement. No such charge may be made if the payment of such installment or the filing of such evidence is made within 60 days after the date on which such installment or filing is due. The amount of any such charge may not exceed an amount equal to 6 percent of the amount of such installment. The school may elect to add the amount of any such charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the first day after the day on which such installment or evidence was due, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school not later than the due date of the next installment after receipt by the borrower of notice of the assessment of the charge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Authority of schools regarding rate of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A school may provide, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, that during the repayment period of a loan from a loan fund established pursuant to an agreement under this subpart payments of principal and interest by the borrower with respect to all the outstanding loans made to him from loan funds so established shall be at a rate equal to not less than $40 per month.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Authority regarding repayments by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon application by a person who received, and is under an obligation to repay, any loan made to such person as a health professions student to enable him to study medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, or podiatry, the Secretary may undertake to repay (without liability to the applicant) all or any part of such loan, and any interest or portion thereof outstanding thereon, upon his determination, pursuant to regulations establishing criteria therefor, that the applicant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) failed to complete such studies leading to his first professional degree;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is in exceptionally needy circumstances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is from a low-income or disadvantaged family as those terms may be defined by such regulations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) has not resumed, or cannot reasonably be expected to resume, the study of medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, or podiatric medicine, within two years following the date upon which he terminated such studies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Collection efforts by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to attempt to collect any loan which was made under this subpart, which is in default, and which was referred to the Secretary by a school with which the Secretary has an agreement under this subpart, on behalf of that school under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe (including reimbursement from the school's student loan fund for expenses the Secretary may reasonably incur in attempting collection), but only if the school has complied with such requirements as the Secretary may specify by regulation with respect to the collection of loans under this subpart. A loan so referred shall be treated as a debt subject to section 5514 of title 5. Amounts collected shall be deposited in the school's student loan fund. Whenever the Secretary desires the institution of a civil action regarding any such loan, the Secretary shall <!-- PDFPage:769 -->refer the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Elimination of statute of limitation for loan collections</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the purpose of this subsection to ensure that obligations to repay loans under this section are enforced without regard to any Federal or State statutory, regulatory, or administrative limitation on the period within which debts may be enforced.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of Federal or State law, no limitation shall terminate the period within which suit may be filed, a judgment may be enforced, or an offset, garnishment, or other action may be initiated or taken by a school that has an agreement with the Secretary pursuant to section 292q of this title that is seeking the repayment of the amount due from a borrower on a loan made under this subpart after the default of the borrower on such loan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirements for students</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the provisions of this subsection, in the case of student loan funds established under section 292q of this title by schools of medicine or osteopathic medicine, each agreement entered into under such section with such a school shall provide (in addition to the provisions required in subsection (b) of such section) that the school will make a loan from such fund to a student only if the student agrees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to enter and complete a residency training program in primary health care not later than 4 years after the date on which the student graduates from such school; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to practice in such care for 10 years (including residency training in primary health care) or through the date on which the loan is repaid in full, whichever occurs first.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inapplicability to certain students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The requirement established in paragraph (1) regarding the student loan fund of a school does not apply to a student if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the first loan to the student from such fund is made before July 1, 1993; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the loan is made from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) a Federal capital contribution under section 292q of this title that is made from amounts appropriated under section 292t(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#292s_1_target" name="292s_1">1</a></sup> of this title (in this section referred to as an &ldquo;exempt Federal capital contribution&rdquo;); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A Federal capital contribution under section 292q of this title may not be construed as being an exempt Federal capital contribution if the contribution was made from amounts appropriated before October 1, 1990. A school contribution under section 292q of this title <!-- PDFPage:770 -->may not be construed as being an exempt school contribution if the contribution was made pursuant to a Federal capital contribution under such section that was made from amounts appropriated before such date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Noncompliance by student</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each agreement entered into with a student pursuant to paragraph (1) shall provide that, if the student fails to comply with such agreement, the loan involved will begin to accrue interest at a rate of 2 percent per year greater than the rate at which the student would pay if compliant in such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Waivers</h4>
