<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that have a design that is determined by the Secretary to be capable of accommodating the equipment likely to be necessary to capture the carbon dioxide that would otherwise be emitted in flue gas from the plant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) that have an assured revenue stream that covers project capital and operating costs (including servicing all debt obligations covered by the guarantee) that is approved by the Secretary and the relevant State public utility commission; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a project to produce energy from coal (of not more than 13,000 Btu/lb and mined in the western United States) using appropriate advanced integrated gasification combined cycle technology that minimizes and offers the potential to sequester carbon dioxide emissions and that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may include repowering of existing facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may be built in stages;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a project located in a taconite-producing region of the United States that is entitled under the law of the State in which the plant is located to enter into a long-term contract approved by a State public utility commission to sell at least 450 megawatts of output to a utility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) facilities that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) generate one or more hydrogen-rich and carbon monoxide-rich product streams from the gasification of coal or coal waste; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) use those streams to facilitate the production of ultra clean premium fuels through the Fischer-Tropsch process; and</p>
