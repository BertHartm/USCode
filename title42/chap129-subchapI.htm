<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether domestic national service programs can serve as a substitute for the traditional option of military service in the Armed Forces of the United States which, in times of reductions in the size of the Armed Forces, is a diminishing national service opportunity for young Americans.</p>

<p class="note-body">Proc. No. 6662, Apr. 4, 1994, 59 F.R. 16507, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">On September 21, 1993, I had the honor of signing into law the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;82, see Tables for classification], which created the Corporation for National and Community Service. The Corporation was designed to involve Americans of all ages and backgrounds in community projects to address many of our Nation's most important needs&mdash;from educating our children to ensuring public safety to protecting our environment. It was chartered to foster civic responsibility, strengthening the ties that bind us together as a people, while providing educational opportunity for those who make the commitment to serve.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the few short months since the Corporation's establishment, enormous progress has been made toward the achievement of these invaluable goals. Final regulations have been published governing the Corporation's new grant programs, grant application packages have been developed, and a national recruitment effort has begun. As a result of intensive outreach efforts, most states have already established State Commissions on National and Community Service, and many local programs, national nonprofit organizations, institutions of higher education, and Federal agencies are eager to participate. Grant competitions have begun for a summer program that will focus on our Nation's public safety concerns, and all community service grant competitions will be completed by this summer. Finally, the Corporation has established the National Civilian Community Corps, which will take advantage of closed and down-sized military bases to launch environmental clean-up and preservation efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body">The ACTION Agency, provided for by the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973 [42 U.S.C. 4950 et seq.], has worked closely with the Corporation, sharing its many years of experience in engaging Americans in service to their communities. Because the Corporation's initiatives and those programs operated by the ACTION Agency involve similar goals, the National <!-- PDFPage:5288 -->and Community Service Trust Act calls for the merger of ACTION with the Corporation no later than March 22, 1995. To build upon the tremendous accomplishments already achieved by the Corporation, and to facilitate the further development of community service programs across the country, I am pleased to order that the functions of the Director of the ACTION Agency be transferred to the Corporation for National and Community Service.</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW, THEREFORE, I, WILLIAM J. CLINTON, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 203(c)(2) and (d)(1)(B) of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993 [set out above], proclaim that all functions of the Director of the ACTION Agency are hereby transferred to the Corporation for National and Community Service, effective April 4, 1994.</p>
<p class="note-body">IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighteenth.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The rehabilitation, reclamation, and beautification of urban public housing, recreational sites, youth and senior centers, and public roads and public works facilities through the efforts of young people in the United States in an Urban Youth Corps can benefit these youths, while also benefiting their communities, by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) providing them with education and work opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) furthering their understanding and appreciation of the challenges faced by individuals residing in urban communities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) providing them with a means to pay for higher education or to repay indebtedness they have incurred to obtain higher education.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A significant number of housing units for low-income individuals in urban areas has become substandard and unsafe and the deterioration of urban roadways, mass transit systems, and transportation facilities in the United States have contributed to the blight encountered in many cities in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) As a result, urban housing, public works, and transportation resources are in need of labor intensive rehabilitation, reclamation, and beautification work that has been neglected in the past and cannot be adequately carried out by Federal, State, and local government at existing personnel levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Urban youth corps have established a good record of rehabilitating, reclaiming, and beautifying these kinds of resources in a cost-efficient manner, especially when they have worked in partnership with government housing, public works, and transportation authorities and agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to perform, in a cost-effective manner, appropriate service projects to rehabilitate, reclaim, beautify, and improve public housing and public works and transportation facilities and resources in urban areas suffering from high rates of poverty where work will not be performed by existing employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist government housing, public works, and transportation authorities and agencies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to expose young people in the United States to public service while furthering their understanding and appreciation of their community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to expand educational opportunity for individuals who participate in the Urban Youth Corps established by this section by providing them with an increased ability to pursue postsecondary education or job training; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to stimulate interest among young people in the United States in lifelong service to their communities and the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Appropriate service project</h4>
