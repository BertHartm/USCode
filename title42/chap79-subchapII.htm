<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Management of scientific collections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Office of Science and Technology Policy shall develop policies for the management and use of Federal scientific collections to improve the quality, organization, access, including online access, and long-term preservation of such collections for the benefit of the scientific enterprise. In developing those policies the Office of Science and Technology Policy shall consult, as appropriate, with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Federal agencies with such collections; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) representatives of other organizations, institutions, and other entities not a part of the Federal Government that have a stake in the preservation, maintenance, and accessibility of such collections, including State and local government agencies, institutions of higher education, museums, and other entities engaged in the acquisition, holding, management, or use of scientific collections.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Clearinghouse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Office of Science and Technology Policy, in consultation with relevant Federal agencies, shall ensure the development of an online clearinghouse for information on the contents of and access to Federal scientific collections.</p>
