<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) while the economy of the United States is undergoing a sustained period of economic growth resulting in low unemployment and increasing incomes, there continue to be areas suffering economic distress in the form of high unemployment, low incomes, underemployment, and outmigration as well as areas facing sudden economic dislocations due to industrial restructuring and relocation, defense base closures and procurement cutbacks, certain Federal actions (including environmental requirements that result in the removal of economic activities from a locality), and natural disasters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) as the economy of the United States continues to grow, those distressed areas contain significant human and infrastructure resources that are underused;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) expanding international trade and the increasing pace of technological innovation offer both a challenge and an opportunity to the distressed communities of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) while economic development is an inherently local process, the Federal Government should work in partnership with public and private local, regional, and State organizations to ensure that existing resources are not wasted and all Americans have an opportunity to participate in the economic growth of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in order to avoid wasteful duplication of effort and to limit the burden on distressed communities, Federal, State, and local economic development activities should be better planned and coordinated and Federal program requirements should be simplified and made more consistent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the goal of Federal economic development activities should be to work in partnership with local, regional, and State public and private organizations to support the development of private sector businesses and jobs in distressed communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Federal economic development efforts will be more effective if they are coordinated with, and build upon, the trade and technology programs of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) under this chapter, new employment opportunities should be created by developing and expanding new and existing public works and other facilities and resources rather than by merely transferring jobs from one area of the United States to another.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declarations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress declares that, in order to promote a strong and growing economy throughout the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assistance under this chapter should be made available to both rural and urban distressed communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) local communities should work in partnership with neighboring communities, the States, and the Federal Government to increase their capacity to develop and implement comprehensive economic development strategies to address existing, or deter impending, economic distress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether suffering from long-term distress or a sudden dislocation, distressed communities should be encouraged to take advantage of the development opportunities afforded by technological innovation and expanding and newly opened global markets.</p>
