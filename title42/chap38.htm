<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the maintenance of the national economy at a high level is vital to the best interests of the United States, but that some of our regions, counties, and communities are suffering substantial and persistent unemployment and underemployment; that such unemployment and underemployment cause hardship to many individuals and their families, and waste invaluable human resources; that to overcome this problem the Federal Government, in cooperation with the States, should help areas and regions of substantial and persistent unemployment and underemployment to take effective steps in planning and financing their public works and economic development; that Federal financial assistance, including grants for public works and development facilities to communities, industries, enterprises, and individuals in areas needing development should enable such areas to help themselves achieve lasting improvement and enhance the domestic prosperity by the establishment of stable and diversified local economies and improved local conditions, provided that such assistance is preceded by and <!-- PDFPage:3279 -->consistent with sound, long-range economic planning; and that under the provisions of this chapter new employment opportunities should be created by developing and expanding new and existing public works and other facilities and resources rather than by merely transferring jobs from one area of the United States to another. Congress further declares that, in furtherance of maintaining the national economy at a high level, the assistance authorized by this chapter should be made available to both rural and urban areas; that such assistance be available for planning for economic development prior to the actual occurrences of economic distress in order to avoid such condition; and that such assistance be used for long-term economic rehabilitation in areas where long-term economic deterioration has occurred or is taking place.</p>

In the case of any State or political subdivision thereof which the Secretary determines has exhausted its effective taxing and borrowing capacity, the Secretary shall reduce the non-Federal share below such per centum or shall waive the non-Federal share in the case of such a grant for a project in a redevelopment area designated as such under section 3161(a)(6) of this title. In case of any community development corporation which the Secretary determines has exhausted its effective borrowing capacity, the Secretary may reduce the non-Federal share below such per centum or waive the non-Federal share in the case of such a grant for a project in a redevelopment area designated as such under section 3161(a)(6) of this title. Supplementary grant shall be made by the Secretary, in accordance with such regulations as he shall prescribe, by increasing the amounts of direct grants authorized under this section or by the payment of funds appropriated under this chapter to the heads of the departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government responsible for the administration of the applicable Federal programs. Notwithstanding any requirement as to the amount or sources of non-Federal funds that may otherwise be applicable to the Federal program involved, funds provided under this subsection shall be used for the sole purpose of increasing the Federal contribution to specific projects in redevelopment areas under such programs above the fixed maximum portion of the cost of such project otherwise authorized by the applicable law. The term &ldquo;designated Federal grant-in-aid programs,&rdquo; as used in this subsection, means such existing or future Federal grant-in-aid programs assisting in the construction or equipping of facilities as the Secretary may, in furtherance of the purposes of this chapter, designate as eligible for allocation of funds under this section. In determining the amount of any supplementary grant available to any project under this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration the relative needs of the area, the nature of the project to be assisted, and the amount of such fair user charges or other revenues as the project may reasonably be expected to generate in excess of those which would amortize the local share of initial costs and provide for its successful operation and maintenance (including depreciation).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Permissible guarantees; guarantee maximums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to aid in financing, within a redevelopment area, the purchase or development of land and facilities (including machinery and equipment) for industrial or commercial usage, including the construction of new buildings, the rehabilitation of abandoned or unoccupied buildings, and the alteration, conversion, or enlargement of existing buildings by (A) purchasing evidences of indebtedness, (B) making loans (which for purposes of this section shall include participation in loans), (C) guaranteeing loans made to private borrowers by private lending institutions, for any of the purposes referred to in this paragraph upon application of such institution and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, except that no such guarantee shall at any time exceed 90 per centum of the amount of the outstanding unpaid balance of such loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to any other financial assistance under this subchapter, the Secretary is authorized, in the case of any loan guarantee under authority of paragraph (1) of this section, to pay to or on behalf of the private borrower an amount sufficient to reduce up to 4 percentage points the interest paid by such borrower on such guaranteed loans. No payment under this paragraph shall result in the interest rate being paid by a borrower on such a guaranteed loan being less than the rate of interest for such a loan if it were made under section 3141 of this title. Payments made to or on behalf of such borrower shall be made no less often than annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary is authorized to aid in financing any industrial or commercial activity within a redevelopment area by (A) making working capital loans, (B) guaranteeing working capital loans made to private borrowers by private lending institutions upon application of such institution and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, except that no such guarantee shall at any time exceed 90 per centum of the amount of the outstanding unpaid balance of such loan, (C) guaranteeing rental payments of leases for buildings and equipment, except that no such guarantee shall exceed 90 per centum of the remaining rental payments required by the lease. (D) paying those debts with respect to which a lien against property has been legally obtained (including the refinancing of any such debt) in any case where the Secretary determines that it is essential to do so in order to save employment in a designated area, to avoid a significant rise in unemployment, or to create new or increased employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Financial assistance under this section shall be on such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, subject, however, to the following restrictions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such financial assistance shall not be extended to assist establishments relocating from one area to another or to assist subcontractors whose purpose is to divest, or whose economic success is dependent upon divesting, other contractors or subcontractors of contracts theretofore customarily performed by them: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such limitation shall not be construed to prohibit assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary of such entity if the Secretary finds that the establishment of such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary will not result in an increase in unemployment of the area of original location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations, unless the Secretary has reason to believe that such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity in the area of its original location or in any other area where it conducts such operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such assistance shall be extended only to applicants, both private and public (including Indian tribes), which have been approved for such assistance by an agency or instrumentality of the State or political subdivision thereof in which the project to be financed is located, and which agency or instrumentality is directly concerned with problems of economic development in such State or subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The project for which financial assistance is sought must be reasonably calculated to <!-- PDFPage:3286 -->provide more than a temporary alleviation of unemployment or underemployment within the redevelopment area wherein it is or will be located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) No loan or guarantee shall be extended hereunder unless the financial assistance applied for is not otherwise available from private lenders or from other Federal agencies on terms which in the opinion of the Secretary will permit the accomplishment of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Secretary shall not make any loan without a participation unless he determines that the loan cannot be made on a participation basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) No evidences of indebtedness shall be purchased and no loans shall be made or guaranteed unless it is determined that there is reasonable assurance of repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Subject to section 3211(5) of this title, no loan or guarantee, including renewals or extension thereof, may be made hereunder for a period exceeding twenty-five years and no evidences of indebtedness maturing more than twenty-five years from date of purchase may be purchased hereunder: <em>Provided</em>, That the foregoing restrictions on maturities shall not apply to securities or obligations received by the Secretary as a claimant in bankruptcy or equitable reorganization or as a creditor in other proceedings attendant upon insolvency of the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Loans made and evidences of indebtedness purchased under this section shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Secretary may determine to be consistent with its purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Loan assistance (other than for a working capital loan) shall not exceed 65 per centum of the aggregate cost to the applicant (excluding all other Federal aid in connection with the undertaking) of acquiring or developing land and facilities (including machinery and equipment), and of constructing, altering, converting, rehabilitating, or enlarging the building or buildings of the particular project, and shall, among others, be on the condition that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) other funds are available in an amount which, together with the assistance provided hereunder, shall be sufficient to pay such aggregate cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not less than 15 per centum of such aggregate cost be supplied as equity capital or as a loan repayable in no shorter period of time and at no faster an amortization rate than the Federal financial assistance extended under this section is being repaid, and if such a loan is secured, its security shall be subordinate and inferior to the lien or liens securing such Federal financial assistance: <em>Provided, however</em>, That, except in projects involving financial participation by Indian tribes, not less than 5 per centum of such aggregate cost shall be supplied by the State or any agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision thereof, or by a community or area organization which is nongovernmental in character, unless the Secretary shall determine in accordance with objective standards promulgated by regulation that all or part of such funds are not reasonably available to the project because of the economic distress of the area or for other good cause, in which case he may waive the requirement of this provision to the extent of such unavailability, and allow the funds required by this subsection to be supplied by the applicant or by such other non-Federal source as may reasonably be available to the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to the extent the Secretary finds such action necessary to encourage financial participation in a particular project by other lenders and investors, and except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B), any Federal financial assistance extended under this section may be repayable only after other loans made in connection with such project have been repaid in full, and the security, if any, for such Federal financial assistance may be subordinate and inferior to the lien or liens securing other loans made in connection with the same project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) No such assistance shall be extended unless there shall be submitted to and approved by the Secretary an overall program for the economic development of the area and a finding by the State, or any agency, instrumentality, or local political subdivision thereof, that the project for which financial assistance is sought is consistent with such program: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this chapter shall authorize financial assistance for any project prohibited by laws of the State or local political subdivision in which the project would be located, nor prevent the Secretary from requiring such periodic revisions of previously approved overall economic development programs as he may deem appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization of appropriations; apportionment among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are hereby authorized to be appropriated $35,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and $75,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1976, $18,750,000 for the period beginning July 1, 1976, and ending September 30, 1976, and $75,000,000 per fiscal year for the fiscal years ending September 30, 1977, September 30, 1978, September 30, 1979, September 30, 1980, and September 30, 1981, for apportionment by the Secretary among the States for the purpose of supplementing or making grants and loans authorized under subchapters I, II, III (other than planning grants authorized under sections 3151(b) and 3151a of this title), IV, and IX of this chapter. Such funds shall be apportioned among the States in the ratio which all grants made under subchapter I of this chapter since August 26, 1965, in each State bear to the total of all such grants made in all the States since August 26, 1965.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contributions by State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds apportioned to a State pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be available for supplementing or making such grants or loans if the State makes a contribution of at least 25 per centum of the amount of such grant or loan in each case. Funds apportioned to a State under subsection (a) of this section shall remain available to such State until obligated or expended by it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds apportioned to a State pursuant to this section may be used by the Governor in supplementing grants or loans with respect to any project or assistance authorized under subchapters I, II, III (other than planning grants authorized under sections 3151(b) and 3151a of this title), IV, and IX of this chapter and approved by the Secretary after July 1, 1974. Such grants may be used to reduce or waive the non-Federal share otherwise required by this chapter, subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Federal contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any grant or loan for which all or any portion of the basic Federal contribution to the project under this chapter is proposed to be made with funds available under this section, no such Federal contribution shall be made until the Secretary of Commerce certifies that such project meets all of the requirements of this chapter and could be approved for Federal contributions under this chapter if funds were available under this chapter (other than section 3188a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3153_1_target" name="3153_1">1</a></sup> of this title) for such project. Funds may be provided for projects in a State under this section only if the Secretary determines that the level of Federal and State financial assistance under this chapter (other than section 3188a of this title) and under Acts other than this chapter, for the same type of projects in the State, will not be diminished in order to substitute funds authorized by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Applicability of State planning process to use of funds</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria for determining eligible areas; unemployment; median family income; Indian lands; loss of major source of employment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall designate as &ldquo;redevelopment areas&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) those areas in which he determines, upon the basis of standards generally comparable with those set forth in paragraphs (A) and (B), that there has existed substantial and persistent unemployment for an extended period of time and those areas in which he determines there has been a substantial loss of population due to lack of employment opportunity. There shall be included among the areas so designated any area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) where the Secretary of Labor finds that the current rate of unemployment, as determined by appropriate annual statistics for the most recent twelve consecutive months, is 6 per centum or more and has averaged at least 6 per centum for the qualifying time periods specified in paragraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) where the Secretary of Labor finds that the annual average rate of unemployment has been at least&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 50 per centum above the national average for three of the preceding four calendar years, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 75 per centum above the national average for two of the preceding three calendar years, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) 100 per centum above the national average for one of the preceding two calendar years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary of Labor shall find the facts and provide the data to be used by the Secretary in making the determinations required by this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) those additional areas which have a median family income not in excess of 50 per centum of the national median, as determined by the most recent available statistics for such areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) those additional Federal or State Indian reservations or trust or restricted Indian-owned land areas which the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Interior or an appropriate State agency, determines manifest the greatest degree of economic distress on the basis of unemployment and income statistics and other appropriate evidence of economic underdevelopment; <em>Provided, however</em>, That uninhabited Federal or State Indian reservations or trust or restricted Indian-owned land areas may be designated where such designation would permit assistance to Indian tribes, with a direct beneficial effect on the economic well-being of Indians;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) upon request of such areas, those additional areas in which the Secretary determines that the loss, removal, curtailment, or closing of a major source of employment has caused within three years prior to, or threatens to cause within three years after, the date of the request an unusual and abrupt rise in unemployment of such magnitude that the unemployment rate for the area at the time of the request exceeds the national average, or can reasonably be expected to exceed the national average, by 50 per centum or more unless assistance is provided. Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (b) of this section to the contrary, an area designated under the authority of this paragraph may be given a reasonable time after designation in which to submit the overall economic development program required by section 3142(b)(10) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) notwithstanding any provisions of this section to the contrary, those additional areas which were designated redevelopment areas under the Area Redevelopment Act [42 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.] on or after March 1, 1965: <em>Provided, however</em>, That the continued eligibility of such areas after the first annual review of eligibility conducted in accordance with section 3162 of this title shall be dependent on their qualification for designation under the standards of economic need set forth in subsections (a)(1) through (a)(4) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) those communities or neighborhoods (defined without regard to political or other subdivisions or boundaries) which the Secretary determines have one of the following conditions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a large concentration of low-income persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) rural areas having substantial outmigration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) substantial unemployment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) an actual or threatened abrupt rise of unemployment due to the closing or curtailment of a major source of employment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">No redevelopment area established under this paragraph shall be subject to the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of section 3131 of this title. No redevelopment area established under this paragraph shall be eligible to meet the requirements of section 3171(a)(1)(B) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) those areas where per capita employment has declined significantly during the next preceding ten-year period for which appropriate statistics are available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) those areas which the Secretary of Labor determines, on the basis of average annual available unemployment statistics, to have experienced unemployment which is both substantial and above the national average for the preceding twenty-four months;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) those areas which the Secretary determines have demonstrated long-term economic deterioration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Size and boundaries of redevelopment areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The size and boundaries of redevelopment areas shall be as determined by the Secretary: <em>Provided, however</em>, That&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no area shall be designated until it has an approved overall economic development program in accordance with section 3142(b)(10) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any area which does not submit an acceptable overall economic development program in accordance with section 3142(b)(10) of this title within a reasonable time after notifi<!-- PDFPage:3293 -->cation of eligibility for designation, shall not thereafter be designated prior to the next annual review of eligibility in accordance with section 3162 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) no area shall be designated which does not have a population of at least one thousand five hundred persons, except that this limitation shall not apply to any area designated under subsection (a)(3) or (a)(6) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) except for areas designated under subsections (a)(3), (a)(4) and (a)(6) hereof, no area shall be designated which is smaller than a &ldquo;labor area&rdquo; (as defined by the Secretary of Labor), a county, or a municipality with a population of over twenty-five thousand, whichever in the opinion of the Secretary is appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this subsection shall prevent any municipality, designated as a redevelopment area or eligible to be designated as a redevelopment area, from combining with any other community having mutual economic interests and transportation and marketing patterns for the purposes of such designation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of data compiled by other Secretaries in making determination of redevelopment areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the request of the Secretary, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Interior, and such other heads of agencies as may be appropriate are authorized to conduct such special studies, obtain such information, and compile and furnish to the Secretary such data as the Secretary may deem necessary or proper to enable him to make the determinations provided for in this section. The Secretary shall reimburse when appropriate, out of any funds appropriated to carry out the purposes of this chapter, the foregoing officers for any expenditures incurred by them under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Designation of areas most nearly qualifying as redevelopment areas in event of failure of any area in State to qualify under preceding subsections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State has no area designated under the preceding subsections of this section as a redevelopment area, the Secretary shall designate as a redevelopment area that area in such State which in his opinion most nearly qualifies under such preceding subsections. An area so designated shall have its eligibility terminated in accordance with the provisions of section 3162 of this title if any other area within the same State subsequently has become qualified or been designated under any other subsection of this section other than subsection (a)(6) as of the time of the annual review prescribed by section 3162 of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary shall not terminate any designations of an area in a State as a redevelopment area if to do so would result in such State having no redevelopment area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Redevelopment area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this chapter, the term &ldquo;redevelopment area&rdquo; refers to any area within the United States which has been designated by the Secretary as a redevelopment area.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recovery Planning Council; designation; membership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any area affected by a major disaster the Governor may request the President for assistance under this subchapter. The Governor, within thirty days after authorization of such assistance by the President, shall designate a Recovery Planning Council for such area or for each part thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such Recovery Planning Council shall be composed of not less than five members, a majority of whom shall be local elected officials of political subdivisions within the affected areas, at least one representative of the State, and a representative of the Federal Government appointed by the President in accordance with paragraph (3) of this subsection. During the major disaster, the Federal coordinating officer shall also serve on the Recovery Planning Council.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Federal representative on such Recovery Planning Council may be the Chairman of the Federal Regional Council for the affected area, or a member of the Federal Regional Council designated by the Chairman of such Regional Council. The Federal representative on such Recovery Planning Council may be the Federal Cochairman of the Regional Commission established pursuant to subchapter V&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3232_1_target" name="3232_1">1</a></sup> of this chapter, or the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 [40 App. U.S.C. 1 et seq.] or his designee, where all of the area affected by a major disaster is within the boundaries of such Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Governor may designate an existing multijurisdictional organization as the Recovery Planning Council where such organization complies with paragraph (2) of this subsection with the addition of State and Federal representatives except that if all or part of an area affected by a major disaster is within the jurisdiction of an existing multijurisdictional organization established under subchapter IV of this chapter or title III of the Appalachian Regional Development Act of 1965 [40 App. U.S.C. 301 et seq.], such organization, with the addition of State and Federal representatives in accordance with paragraph (2) of this subsection, shall be designated by the Governor as the Recovery Planning Council. In any case in which such title III or subchapter IV organization is designated as the Recovery Planning Council under this paragraph, some local elected officials of political subdivisions within the affected areas must be appointed to serve on such Recovery Planning Council. Where possible, the organization designated as the Recovery Planning Council shall be or shall be subsequently designated as the appropriate agency required by section 3334 of this title and by chapter 65 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Recovery Planning Council shall include private citizens as members to the extent feasible, and shall provide for and encourage public participation in its deliberations and decisions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review and revision of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Recovery Planning Council (1) shall review existing plans for the affected area; and (2) may recommend to the Governor and responsible local governments such revisions as it determines necessary for the economic recovery of the area, including the development of new plans and the preparation of a recovery investment plan for the 5&ndash;year period following the declaration of the major disaster. The Recovery Planning Council shall accept as one element of the recovery investment plans determinations made under section 5172(c) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recovery investment plan; reserve funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A recovery investment plan prepared by a Recovery Planning Council may recommend the revision, deletion, reprograming, or additional approval of Federal-aid projects and programs within the area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for which application has been made but approval not yet granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for which funds have been obligated or approval granted but construction not yet begun;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for which funds have been or are scheduled to be apportioned within the five years after the declaration of the disaster;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) which may reasonably be anticipated as becoming available under existing programs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the recommendation of the Recovery Planning Council and the request of the Governor, any funds for projects or programs identified pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection may, to any extent consistent with appropriation Acts, be placed in reserve by the responsible Federal agency for use in accordance with such recommendations. Upon the request of the Governor and with the concurrence of affected local governments, such funds may be transferred to the Recovery Planning Council to be expended in the implementation of the recovery investment plan, except that no such transfer may be made unless such expenditure is for a project or program for which such funds originally were made available by an appropriation Act.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to make supplementary grants to increase the Federal share for projects for which funds are reserved pursuant to section 3232(c)(2) of this title, or other Federal-aid projects in the affected area.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Eligible recipients; execution of development plan; use; method of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to make grants directly to any eligible recipient in an area (A) which the Secretary has determined has experienced, or may reasonably be foreseen to be about to experience, a special need to meet an expected rise in unemployment, or other economic adjustment problems (including those caused by any action or decision of the Federal Government), or (B) which the Secretary determines has demonstrated long-term economic deterioration, to carry out or develop a plan which meets the requirements of subsection (b) of this section and which is approved by the Secretary to use such grants for any of the following: public facilities, public services, business development, planning, unemployment compensation (in accordance with subsection (d) of this section), rent supplements, mortgage payment assistance, research, technical assistance, training, relocation of individuals, and businesses, and other assistance which demonstrably furthers the economic adjustment objectives of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Such grants may be used in direct expenditures by the eligible recipient or through redistribution by it to public and private entities in grants, loans, loan guarantees, payments to reduce interest on loan guarantees, or other appropriate assistance, but no grant shall be made by an eligible recipient to a private profitmaking entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Grants for unemployment compensation shall be made to the State. Grants for any other purpose shall be made to any appropriate eligible recipient capable of carrying out such purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria for approval of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No plan shall be approved by the Secretary under this section unless such plan shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) describe each activity planned to meet each such need;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) explain the details of the method of carrying out each such planned activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contain assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the proceeds from the repayment of loans made by the eligible recipient with funds granted under this subchapter will be used for economic adjustment; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of funds; availability of assistance to qualified individuals; limitation of amounts; administration by State agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In each case in which the Secretary determines a need for assistance under subsection (a) of this section due to an increase in unemployment and makes a grant under this section, the Secretary may transfer funds available for such grant to the Secretary of Labor and the Sec<!-- PDFPage:3306 -->retary of Labor is authorized to provide to any individual unemployed as a result of the dislocation for which such grant is made, such assistance as he deems appropriate while the individual is unemployed. Such assistance as the Secretary of Labor may provide shall be available to an individual not otherwise disqualified under State law for unemployment compensation benefits, as long as the individual's unemployment caused by the dislocation continues or until the individual is reemployed in a suitable position, but no longer than one year after the unemployment commences. Such assistance for a week of unemployment shall not exceed the maximum weekly amount authorized under the unemployment compensation law of the State in which the dislocation occurred, and the amount of assistance under this subsection shall be reduced by any amount of unemployment compensation or of private income protection insurance compensation available to such individual for such week of unemployment. The Secretary of Labor is directed to provide such assistance through agreements with States which, in his judgment, have an adequate system for administering such assistance through existing State agencies.</p>
