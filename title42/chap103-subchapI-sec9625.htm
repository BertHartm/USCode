<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Revision of hazard ranking system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall apply only to facilities which are not included or proposed for inclusion on the National Priorities List and which contain substantial volumes of waste described in section 6921(b)(3)(A)(i) of this title. As expeditiously as practicable, the President shall revise the hazard ranking system in effect under the National Contingency Plan with respect to such facilities in a manner which assures appropriate consideration of each of the following site-specific characteristics of such facilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The quantity, toxicity, and concentrations of hazardous constituents which are present in such waste and a comparison thereof with other wastes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The extent of, and potential for, release of such hazardous constituents into the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The degree of risk to human health and the environment posed by such constituents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inclusion prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until the hazard ranking system is revised as required by this section, the President may not include on the National Priorities List any facility which contains substantial volumes of waste described in section 6921(b)(3)(A)(i) of this title on the basis of an evaluation made principally on the volume of such waste and not on the concentrations of the hazardous constituents of such waste. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the President's authority to include any such facility on the National Priorities List based on the presence of other substances at such facility or to exercise any other authority of this chapter with respect to such other substances.</p>
