<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds that the welfare of the Nation and of its people is directly dependent upon the sound and orderly development and the effective organization and functioning of our State and local governments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It further finds that it is essential that our State and local governments prepare, keep current, and carry out comprehensive plans and programs for their orderly physical development with a view to meeting efficiently all their economic and social needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It further finds that our State and local governments are especially handicapped in this task by the complexity and scope of governmental services required, the multiplicity of political jurisdictions and agencies involved, and the inadequacy of the operational and administrative arrangements available for cooperation among them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">It further finds that present requirements for areawide planning and programing in connection with various Federal programs have materially assisted in the solution of areawide problems, but that greater coordination of Federal programs and additional participation and cooperation are needed from the States and localities in perfecting and carrying out such efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is the purpose of this subchapter to provide through greater coordination of Federal programs, and through supplementary grants for certain federally assisted development projects, additional encouragement and assistance to States and localities for making comprehensive areawide planning and programing effective.</p>
