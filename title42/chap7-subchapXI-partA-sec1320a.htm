<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The aggregate cost of operation and the aggregate volume of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The costs and volume of services for various functional accounts and subaccounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Rates, by category of patient and class of purchaser.</p>

In reporting under such a system, hospitals shall employ such chart of accounts, definitions, principles, and statistics as the Secretary may prescribe in order to reach a uniform reconciliation of financial and statistical data for specified uniform reports to be provided to the Secretary.</p>
