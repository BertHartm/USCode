<p class="note-body">Section 10606(b)(4) of this title, referred to in subsec. (c)(3)(D), was in the original &ldquo;section 1102(b)(4)&rdquo;, meaning section 1102(b)(4) of Pub. L. 101&ndash;647, which has been translated as reading section 502(b)(4) of Pub. L. 101&ndash;647 to reflect the probable intent of Congress because Pub. L. 101&ndash;647 does not contain a section 1102 and section 502(b)(4) relates to the right of crime victims to be present at public court proceedings.</p>
