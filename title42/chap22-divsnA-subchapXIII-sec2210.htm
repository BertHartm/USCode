<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of financial protection for licensees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each license issued under section 2133 or 2134 of this title and each construction permit issued under section 2235 of this title shall, and each license issued under section 2073, 2093, or 2111 of this title may, for the public purposes cited in section 2012(i) of this title, have as a condition of the license a requirement that the licensee have and maintain financial protection of such type and in such amounts as the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) in the exercise of its licensing and regulatory authority and responsibility shall require in accordance with subsection (b) of this section to cover public liability claims. Whenever such financial protection is required, it may be a further condition of the license that the licensee execute and maintain an indemnification agreement in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. The Commission may require, as a further condition of issuing a license, that an applicant waive any immunity from public liability conferred by Federal or State law.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2823 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount and type of financial protection for licensees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of primary financial protection required shall be the amount of liability insurance available from private sources, except that the Commission may establish a lesser amount on the basis of criteria set forth in writing, which it may revise from time to time, taking into consideration such factors as the following: (A) the cost and terms of private insurance, (B) the type, size, and location of the licensed activity and other factors pertaining to the hazard, and (C) the nature and purpose of the licensed activity: <em>Provided,</em> That for facilities designed for producing substantial amounts of electricity and having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more, the amount of primary financial protection required shall be the maximum amount available at reasonable cost and on reasonable terms from private sources (excluding the amount of private liability insurance available under the industry retrospective rating plan required in this subsection). Such primary financial protection may include private insurance, private contractual indemnities, self-insurance, other proof of financial responsibility, or a combination of such measures and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission may, by rule, regulation, or order, prescribe. The Commission shall require licensees that are required to have and maintain primary financial protection equal to the maximum amount of liability insurance available from private sources to maintain, in addition to such primary financial protection, private liability insurance available under an industry retrospective rating plan providing for premium charges deferred in whole or major part until public liability from a nuclear incident exceeds or appears likely to exceed the level of the primary financial protection required of the licensee involved in the nuclear incident: <em>Provided,</em> That such insurance is available to, and required of, all of the licensees of such facilities without regard to the manner in which they obtain other types or amounts of such primary financial protection: <em>And provided further,</em> That the maximum amount of the standard deferred premium that may be charged a licensee following any nuclear incident under such a plan shall not be more than $63,000,000 (subject to adjustment for inflation under subsection (t) of this section), but not more than $10,000,000 in any 1 year, for each facility for which such licensee is required to maintain the maximum amount of primary financial protection: <em>And provided further,</em> That the amount which may be charged a licensee following any nuclear incident shall not exceed the licensee's pro rata share of the aggregate public liability claims and costs (excluding legal costs subject to subsection (<em>o</em>)(1)(D) of this section, payment of which has not been authorized under such subsection) arising out of the nuclear incident. Payment of any State premium taxes which may be applicable to any deferred premium provided for in this chapter shall be the responsibility of the licensee and shall not be included in the retrospective premium established by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commission may, on a case by case basis, assess annual deferred premium amounts less than the standard annual deferred premium amount assessed under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for any facility, if more than one nuclear incident occurs in any one calendar year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for any licensee licensed to operate more than one facility, if the Commission determines that the financial impact of assessing the standard annual deferred premium amount under paragraph (1) would result in undue financial hardship to such licensee or the ratepayers of such licensee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the event that the Commission assesses a lesser annual deferred premium amount under subparagraph (A), the Commission shall require payment of the difference between the standard annual deferred premium assessment under paragraph (1) and any such lesser annual deferred premium assessment within a reasonable period of time, with interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the date that the standard annual deferred premium assessment under paragraph (1) would become due.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commission shall establish such requirements as are necessary to assure availability of funds to meet any assessment of deferred premiums within a reasonable time when due, and may provide reinsurance or shall otherwise guarantee the payment of such premiums in the event it appears that the amount of such premiums will not be available on a timely basis through the resources of private industry and insurance. Any agreement by the Commission with a licensee or indemnitor to guarantee the payment of deferred premiums may contain such terms as the Commission deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section and to assure reimbursement to the Commission for its payments made due to the failure of such licensee or indemnitor to meet any of its obligations arising under or in connection with financial protection required under this subsection including without limitation terms creating liens upon the licensed facility and the revenues derived therefrom or any other property or revenues of such licensee to secure such reimbursement and consent to the automatic revocation of any license.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) In the event that the funds available to pay valid claims in any year are insufficient as a result of the limitation on the amount of deferred premiums that may be required of a licensee in any year under paragraph (1) or (2), or the Commission is required to make reinsurance or guaranteed payments under paragraph (3), the Commission shall, in order to advance the necessary funds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) request the Congress to appropriate sufficient funds to satisfy such payments; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, issue to the Secretary of the Treasury obligations in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as may be agreed to by the Commission and the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:2824 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) Except for funds appropriated for purposes of making reinsurance or guaranteed payments under paragraph (3), any funds appropriated under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be repaid to the general fund of the United States Treasury from amounts made available by standard deferred premium assessments, with interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the date that the funds appropriated under such subparagraph are made available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Except for funds appropriated for purposes of making reinsurance or guaranteed payments under paragraph (3), redemption of obligations issued under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be made by the Commission from amounts made available by standard deferred premium assessments. Such obligations shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury by taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations to the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of the obligations under this paragraph. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any issued obligations, and for such purpose the Secretary of the Treasury may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchase of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the obligations acquired by the Secretary of the Treasury under this paragraph. All redemptions, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of obligations under this paragraph shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Indemnification of licenses by Nuclear Regulatory Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall, with respect to licenses issued between August 30, 1954, and August 1, 2002, for which it requires financial protection of less than $560,000,000, agree to indemnify and hold harmless the licensee and other persons indemnified, as their interest may appear, from public liability arising from nuclear incidents which is in excess of the level of financial protection required of the licensee. The aggregate indemnity for all persons indemnified in connection with each nuclear incident shall not exceed $500,000,000 excluding costs of investigating and settling claims and defending suits for damage: <em>Provided, however,</em> That this amount of indemnity shall be reduced by the amount that the financial protection required shall exceed $60,000,000. Such a contract of indemnification shall cover public liability arising out of or in connection with the licensed activity. With respect to any production or utilization facility for which a construction permit is issued between August 30, 1954, and August 1, 2002, the requirements of this subsection shall apply to any license issued for such facility subsequent to August 1, 2002.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Indemnification of contractors by Department of Energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In addition to any other authority the Secretary of Energy (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) may have, the Secretary shall, until August 1, 2002, enter into agreements of indemnification under this subsection with any person who may conduct activities under a contract with the Department of Energy that involve the risk of public liability and that are not subject to financial protection requirements under subsection (b) of this section or agreements of indemnification under subsection (c) or (k) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i)(I) Beginning 60 days after August 20, 1988, agreements of indemnification under subparagraph (A) shall be the exclusive means of indemnification for public liability arising from activities described in such subparagraph, including activities conducted under a contract that contains an indemnification clause under Public Law 85&ndash;804 [50 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.] entered into between August 1, 1987, and August 20, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) The Secretary may incorporate in agreements of indemnification under subparagraph (A) the provisions relating to the waiver of any issue or defense as to charitable or governmental immunity authorized in subsection (n)(1) of this section to be incorporated in agreements of indemnification. Any such provisions incorporated under this subclause shall apply to any nuclear incident arising out of nuclear waste activities subject to an agreement of indemnification under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Public liability arising out of nuclear waste activities subject to an agreement of indemnification under subparagraph (A) that are funded by the Nuclear Waste Fund established in section 10222 of this title shall be compensated from the Nuclear Waste Fund in an amount not to exceed the maximum amount of financial protection required of licensees under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In agreements of indemnification entered into under paragraph (1), the Secretary may require the contractor to provide and maintain financial protection of such a type and in such amounts as the Secretary shall determine to be appropriate to cover public liability arising out of or in connection with the contractual activity, and shall indemnify the persons indemnified against such claims above the amount of the financial protection required, to the full extent of the aggregate public liability of the persons indemnified for each nuclear incident, including such legal costs of the contractor as are approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), if the maximum amount of financial protection required of licensees under subsection (b) of this section is increased by the Commission, the amount of indemnity, together with any financial protection required of the contractor, shall at all times remain equal to or greater than the maximum amount of financial protection required of licensees under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount of indemnity provided contractors under this subsection shall not, at any time, be reduced in the event that the maximum amount of financial protection required of licensees is reduced.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2825 --><p class="statutory-body">(C) All agreements of indemnification under which the Department of Energy (or its predecessor agencies) may be required to indemnify any person, shall be deemed to be amended, on August 20, 1988, to reflect the amount of indemnity for public liability and any applicable financial protection required of the contractor under this subsection on August 20, 1988.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Financial protection under paragraph (2) and indemnification under paragraph (1) shall be the exclusive means of financial protection and indemnification under this section for any Department of Energy demonstration reactor licensed by the Commission under section 5842 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of nuclear incidents occurring outside the United States, the amount of the indemnity provided by the Secretary under this subsection shall not exceed $100,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The provisions of this subsection may be applicable to lump sum as well as cost type contracts and to contracts and projects financed in whole or in part by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A contractor with whom an agreement of indemnification has been executed under paragraph (1)(A) and who is engaged in activities connected with the underground detonation of a nuclear explosive device shall be liable, to the extent so indemnified under this subsection, for injuries or damage sustained as a result of such detonation in the same manner and to the same extent as would a private person acting as principal, and no immunity or defense founded in the Federal, State, or municipal character of the contractor or of the work to be performed under the contract shall be effective to bar such liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on aggregate public liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The aggregate public liability for a single nuclear incident of persons indemnified, including such legal costs as are authorized to be paid under subsection (<em>o</em>)(1)(D) of this section, shall not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of facilities designed for producing substantial amounts of electricity and having a rated capacity of 100,000 electrical kilowatts or more, the maximum amount of financial protection required of such facilities under subsection (b) of this section (plus any surcharge assessed under subsection (<em>o</em>)(1)(E) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of contractors with whom the Secretary has entered into an agreement of indemnification under subsection (d) of this section, the maximum amount of financial protection required under subsection (b) of this section or the amount of indemnity and financial protection that may be required under paragraph (3) of subsection (d) of this section, whichever amount is more; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of all other licensees of the Commission required to maintain financial protection under this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the amount of financial protection required of the licensee exceeds $60,000,000, $560,000,000 or the amount of financial protection required of the licensee, whichever amount is more.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event of a nuclear incident involving damages in excess of the amount of aggregate public liability under paragraph (1), the Congress will thoroughly review the particular incident in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (i) of this section and will in accordance with such procedures, take whatever action is determined to be necessary (including approval of appropriate compensation plans and appropriation of funds) to provide full and prompt compensation to the public for all public liability claims resulting from a disaster of such magnitude.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No provision of paragraph (1) may be construed to preclude the Congress from enacting a revenue measure, applicable to licensees of the Commission required to maintain financial protection pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, to fund any action undertaken pursuant to paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) With respect to any nuclear incident occurring outside of the United States to which an agreement of indemnification entered into under the provisions of subsection (d) of this section is applicable, such aggregate public liability shall not exceed the amount of $100,000,000, together with the amount of financial protection required of the contractor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Collection of fees by Nuclear Regulatory Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, is authorized to collect a fee from all persons with whom an indemnification agreement is executed under this section. This fee shall be $30 per year per thousand kilowatts of thermal energy capacity for facilities licensed under section 2133 of this title: <em>Provided,</em> That the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, is authorized to reduce the fee for such facilities in reasonable relation to increases in financial protection required above a level of $60,000,000. For facilities licensed under section 2134 of this title, and for construction permits under section 2235 of this title, the Commission is authorized to reduce the fee set forth above. The Commission shall establish criteria in writing for determination of the fee for facilities licensed under section 2134 of this title, taking into consideration such factors as (1) the type, size, and location of facility involved, and other factors pertaining to the hazard, and (2) the nature and purpose of the facility. For other licenses, the Commission shall collect such nominal fees as it deems appropriate. No fee under this subsection shall be less than $100 per year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use of services of private insurers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In administering the provisions of this section, the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, shall use, to the maximum extent practicable, the facilities and services of private insurance organizations, and the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, may contract to pay a reasonable compensation for such services. Any contract made under the provisions of this subsection may be made without regard to the provisions of section 5 of title 41 upon a showing by the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, that advertising is not reasonably practicable and advance payments may be made.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2826 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Conditions of agreements of indemnification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agreement of indemnification may contain such terms as the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, deems appropriate to carry out the purposes of this section. Such agreement shall provide that, when the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, makes a determination that the United States will probably be required to make indemnity payments under this section, the Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, shall collaborate with any person indemnified and may approve the payment of any claim under the agreement of indemnification, appear through the Attorney General on behalf of the person indemnified, take charge of such action, and settle or defend any such action. The Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, shall have final authority on behalf of the United States to settle or approve the settlement of any such claim on a fair and reasonable basis with due regard for the purposes of this chapter. Such settlement shall not include expenses in connection with the claim incurred by the person indemnified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Compensation plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After any nuclear incident involving damages that are likely to exceed the applicable amount of aggregate public liability under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (e)(1) of this section, the Secretary or the Commisison,<sup><a href="#2210_1_target" name="2210_1">1</a></sup> as appropriate, shall&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 90 days after any determination by a court, pursuant to subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section, that the public liability from a single nuclear incident may exceed the applicable amount of aggregate public liability under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (e)(1) of this section the President shall submit to the Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an estimate of the aggregate dollar value of personal injuries and property damage that arises from the nuclear incident and exceeds the amount of aggregate public liability under subsection (e)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recommendations for additional sources of funds to pay claims exceeding the applicable amount of aggregate public liability under subparagraph (A), (B), or (C) of subsection (e)(1) of this section, which recommendations shall consider a broad range of possible sources of funds (including possible revenue measures on the sector of the economy, or on any other class, to which such revenue measures might be applied);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 1 or more compensation plans, that either individually or collectively shall provide for full and prompt compensation for all valid claims and contain a recommendation or recommendations as to the relief to be provided, including any recommendations that funds be allocated or set aside for the payment of claims that may arise as a result of latent injuries that may not be discovered until a later date; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate and as such it is deemed a part of the rules of the Senate, but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in the Senate in the case of resolutions described by subparagraph (B) and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that it is inconsistent therewith; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the Senate to change the rules at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.</p>

With respect to licenses issued between August 30, 1954, and August 1, 2002, for which the Commission grants such exemption:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Commission shall agree to indemnify and hold harmless the licensee and other persons indemnified, as their interests may appear, from public liability in excess of $250,000 arising from nuclear incidents.

The waiver of any such issue or defense shall be effective regardless of whether such issue or defense may otherwise be deemed jurisdictional or relating to an element in the cause of action. When so incorporated, such waivers shall be judicially enforcible in accordance with their terms by the claimant against the person indemnified. Such waivers shall not preclude a defense based upon a failure to take reasonable steps to mitigate damages, nor shall such waivers apply to injury or damage to a claimant or to a claimant's property which is intentionally sustained by the claimant or which results from a nuclear incident intentionally and wrongfully caused by the claimant.

Process of such district court shall be effective throughout the United States. In any action that is or becomes removable pursuant to this paragraph, a petition for removal shall be filed within the period provided in section 1446 of title 28 or within the 30-day period beginning on August 20, 1988, whichever occurs later.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Total payments made by or for all indemnitors as a result of such nuclear incident shall not exceed 15 per centum of such limit of liability without the prior approval of such court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The court shall not authorize payments in excess of 15 per centum of such limit of liability unless the court determines that such <!-- PDFPage:2830 -->payments are or will be in accordance with a plan of distribution which has been approved by the court or such payments are not likely to prejudice the subsequent adoption and implementation by the court of a plan of distribution pursuant to subparagraph (C); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Commission or the Secretary, as appropriate, shall, and any other indemnitor or other interested person may, submit to such district court a plan for the disposition of pending claims and for the distribution of remaining funds available. Such a plan shall include an allocation of appropriate amounts for personal injury claims, property damage claims, and possible latent injury claims which may not be discovered until a later time and shall include establishment of priorities between claimants and classes of claims, as necessary to insure the most equitable allocation of available funds. Such court shall have all power necessary to approve, disapprove, or modify plans proposed, or to adopt another plan; and to determine the proportionate share of funds available for each claimant. The Commission or the Secretary as appropriate, any other indemnitor, and any person indemnified shall be entitled to such orders as may be appropriate to implement and enforce the provisions of this section, including orders limiting the liability of the persons indemnified, orders approving or modifying the plan, orders staying the payment of claims and the execution of court judgments, orders apportioning the payments to be made to claimants, and orders permitting partial payments to be made before final determination of the total claims. The orders of such court shall be effective throughout the United States.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A court may authorize the payment of legal costs under paragraph (1)(D) only if the person requesting such payment has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) submitted to the court the amount of such payment requested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) demonstrated to the court&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) that such costs are reasonable and equitable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that such person has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) litigated in good faith;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) avoided unnecessary duplication of effort with that of other parties similarly situated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) not made frivolous claims or defenses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) not attempted to unreasonably delay the prompt settlement or adjudication of such claims.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission and the Secretary shall submit to the Congress by August 1, 1998, detailed reports concerning the need for continuation or modification of the provisions of this section, taking into account the condition of the nuclear industry, availability of private insurance, and the state of knowledge concerning nuclear safety at that time, among other relevant factors, and shall include recommendations as to the repeal or modification of any of the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Establishment</em>. (a) There shall be established an Advisory Committee on Human Radiation Experiments (the &ldquo;Advisory Committee&rdquo; or &ldquo;Committee&rdquo;). The Advisory Committee shall be composed of not more than 15 members to be appointed or designated by the President. The Advisory Committee shall comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended, 5 U.S.C. App.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The President shall designate a Chairperson from among the members of the Advisory Committee.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Functions</em>. (a) There has been established a Human Radiation Interagency Working Group, the members of which include the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Attorney General, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the Director of Central Intelligence, and the Director of the Office of Management and Budget. As set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the Advisory Committee shall provide to the Human Radiation Interagency Working Group advice and recommendations on the ethical and scientific standards applicable to human radiation experiments carried out or sponsored by the United States Government. As used herein, &ldquo;human radiation experiments&rdquo; means:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) experiments on individuals involving intentional exposure to ionizing radiation. This category does not include common and routine clinical practices, such as established diagnosis and treatment methods, involving incidental exposures to ionizing radiation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) experiments involving intentional environmental releases of radiation that (A) were designed to test human health effects of ionizing radiation; or (B) were designed to test the extent of human exposure to ionizing radiation.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Consistent with the provisions set forth in paragraph (b) of this section, the Advisory Committee shall also provide advice, information, and recommendations on the following experiments:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) the experiment into the atmospheric diffusion of radioactive gases and test of detectability, commonly referred to as &ldquo;the Green Run test,&rdquo; by the former Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) and the Air Force in December 1949 at the Hanford Reservation in Richland, Washington;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) two radiation warfare field experiments conducted at the AEC's Oak Ridge office in 1948 involving gamma radiation released from non-bomb point sources at or near ground level;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) six tests conducted during 1949&ndash;1952 of radiation warfare ballistic dispersal devices containing radioactive agents at the U.S. Army's Dugway, Utah, site;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) four atmospheric radiation-tracking tests in 1950 at Los Alamos, New Mexico; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) any other similar experiment that may later be identified by the Human Radiation Interagency Working Group.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The Advisory Committee shall review experiments conducted from 1944 to May 30, 1974. Human radiation experiments undertaken after May 30, 1974, the date of issuance of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (&ldquo;DHEW&rdquo;) Regulations for the Protection of Human Subjects (45 C.F.R. 46), may be sampled to determine whether further inquiry into experiments is warranted. Further inquiry into experiments conducted after May 30, 1974, may be pursued if the Advisory Committee determines, with the concurrence of the Human Radiation Interagency Working Group, that such inquiry is warranted.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b)(1) The Advisory Committee shall determine the ethical and scientific standards and criteria by which it shall evaluate human radiation experiments, as set forth in paragraph (a) of this section. The Advisory Committee shall consider whether (A) there was a clear medical or scientific purpose for the experiments; (B) appropriate medical follow-up was conducted; and (C) the experiments&rsquo; design and administration adequately met the ethical and scientific standards, including standards of informed consent, that prevailed at the time of the experiments and that exist today.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) The Advisory Committee shall evaluate the extent to which human radiation experiments were consistent with applicable ethical and scientific standards as determined by the Committee pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this section. If deemed necessary for such an assessment, the Committee may carry out a detailed review of experiments and associated records to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) If required to protect the health of individuals who were subjects of a human radiation experiment, or their descendants, the Advisory Committee may recommend to the Human Radiation Interagency Working Group that an agency notify particular subjects of an experiment, or their descendants, of any potential health risk or the need for medical follow-up.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The Advisory Committee may recommend further policies, as needed, to ensure compliance with recommended ethical and scientific standards for human radiation experiments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) The Advisory Committee may carry out such additional functions as the Human Radiation Interagency Working Group may from time to time request.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Administration</em>. (a) The heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the Advisory Committee with such information as it may require for purposes of carrying out its functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Members of the Advisory Committee shall be compensated in accordance with Federal law. Committee members may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, to the extent permitted by law for persons serving intermittently in the government service (5 U.S.C. 5701&ndash;5707).</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) To the extent permitted by law, and subject to the availability of appropriations, the Department of Energy shall provide the Advisory Committee with such funds as may be necessary for the performance of its functions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>General Provisions</em>. (a) Notwithstanding the provisions of any other Executive order, the functions of the President under the Federal Advisory Committee Act that are applicable to the Advisory Committee, except that of reporting annually to the Congress, shall be performed by the Human Radiation Interagency Working Group, in accordance with the guidelines and procedures established by the Administrator of General Services.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Advisory Committee shall terminate 30 days after submitting its final report to the Human Radiation Interagency Working Group.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and it is not intended to create any right, benefit, trust, or responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or equity by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>
