<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to the affirmative power of Congress to enact this part under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I of the Constitution, it is the purpose of this part to protect the civil rights of victims of gender motivated violence and to promote public safety, health, and activities affecting interstate commerce by establishing a Federal civil rights cause of action for victims of crimes of violence motivated by gender.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Right to be free from crimes of violence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender (as defined in subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cause of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony against the person or that would constitute a felony against property if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, and that would come within the meaning of State or Federal offenses described in section 16 of title 18, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not those acts were committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prison jurisdiction of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but for the relationship between the person who takes such action and the individual against whom such action is taken.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No prior criminal action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal and State courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to this part.</p>
