<p class="statutory-body">In order to render financial assistance to those States and localities in which the facilities of the Corporation are located, the Corporation shall, beginning in fiscal year 1998, make payments to State and local governments as provided in this section. These payments shall be in lieu of any and all State and local taxes on the real and personal property of the Corporation. All property of the Corporation is expressly exempted from taxation in any manner or form by any State, county, or other local government entity including State, county, or other local government sales tax.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments in lieu of taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning in fiscal year 1998, the Corporation shall make annual payments, in amounts determined by the Corporation to be fair and reasonable, to the State and local governmental agencies having tax jurisdiction in any area where facilities of the Corporation are located. In making these determinations, the Corporation shall be guided by the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Corporation shall take into account the customs and practices prevailing in the area with respect to appraisal, assessment, and classification of industrial property and any special considerations extended to large-scale industrial operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The payment made to any taxing authority for any period shall not be less than the payments that would have been made to the taxing authority for the same period by the Department and its cost-type contractors on behalf of the Department with respect to property that has been transferred to the Corporation under section 2297c&ndash;3&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2297b-9_1_target" name="2297b-9_1">1</a></sup> of this title and that would have been attributable to the ownership, management, operation, and maintenance of the Department's uranium enrichment facilities, applying the laws and policies prevailing immediately prior to the transition date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Time of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments shall be made by the Corporation at the time when payments of taxes by taxpayers to each taxing authority are due and payable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of amount due</h4>
