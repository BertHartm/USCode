<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall make grants for the purpose of providing services described in section 300ff&ndash;14 of this title in transitional areas, subject to the same provisions regarding the allocation of grant funds as apply under subsection (c) of such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transitional areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;transitional area&rdquo; means, subject to subsection (c), a metropolitan area for which there has been reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention a cumulative total of at least 1,000, but fewer than 2,000, cases of AIDS during the most recent period of 5 calendar years for which such data are available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certain eligibility rules</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Fiscal year 2011</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to grants under subsection (a) for fiscal year 2011, a metropolitan area that received funding under subpart I for fiscal year 2010 but does not for fiscal year 2011 qualify under such subpart as an eligible area and does not qualify under subsection (b) as a transitional area shall, notwithstanding subsection (b), be considered a transitional area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Continued status as transitional area</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subsection (b), a metropolitan area that is a transitional area for a fiscal year continues, except as provided in subparagraph (B), to be a transitional area until the metropolitan area fails, for three consecutive fiscal years&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to qualify under such subsection as a transitional area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), to have a cumulative total of 1,500 or more living cases of AIDS (reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year for which such data is available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Permitting margin of error applicable to certain metropolitan areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying subparagraph (A)(ii) for a fiscal year after fiscal year 2008, in the case of a metropolitan area that has a cumulative total of at least 1,400 (and fewer than 1,500) living cases of AIDS as of December 31 of the most recent calendar year for which such data is available, such area shall be treated as having met the criteria of such subparagraph if not more than 5 percent of the total from grants awarded to such area under this part is unobligated as of the end of the most recent fiscal year for which such data is available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exception regarding status as eligible area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B) do not apply for a fiscal year if the metropolitan area involved qualifies under subpart I as an eligible area.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each of the fiscal years 2007 through 2013, the exception described in subpara<!-- PDFPage:1117 -->graph (A) does not apply if the transitional area involved received funding under subpart I for fiscal year 2006.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Type and distribution of grants; timeframe for obligation and expenditure of grant funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Formula grants; supplemental grants</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Formula grants; increase in grant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), section 300ff&ndash;13(a)(4) of this title does not apply.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Pursuant to section 300ff&ndash;13(b)(1) of this title, amounts for the single program are subject to use under sections 300ff&ndash;13(a)(4) and 300ff&ndash;20(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application; technical assistance; definitions</h4>
