<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and at least three months before the effective dates specified in subsection (f) of this section, shall promulgate release detection, prevention, and correction regulations applicable to all owners and operators of underground storage tanks, as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distinctions in regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In promulgating regulations under this section, the Administrator may distinguish between types, classes, and ages of underground storage tanks. In making such distinctions, the Administrator may take into consideration factors, including, but not limited to: location of the tanks, soil and climate conditions, uses of the tanks, history of maintenance, age of the tanks, current industry recommended practices, national consensus codes, hydrogeology, water table, size of the tanks, quantity of regulated substances periodically deposited in or dispensed from the tank, the technical capability of the owners and operators, and the compatibility of the regulated substance and the materials of which the tank is fabricated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The regulations promulgated pursuant to this section shall include, but need not be limited to, the following requirements respecting all underground storage tanks&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) requirements for maintaining a leak detection system, an inventory control system together with tank testing, or a comparable system or method designed to identify releases in a manner consistent with the protection of human health and the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requirements for maintaining records of any monitoring or leak detection system or inventory control system or tank testing or comparable system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requirements for reporting of releases and corrective action taken in response to a release from an underground storage tank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) requirements for taking corrective action in response to a release from an underground storage tank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) requirements for the closure of tanks to prevent future releases of regulated substances into the environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) requirements for maintaining evidence of financial responsibility for taking corrective action and compensating third parties for bodily injury and property damage caused by sudden and nonsudden accidental releases arising from operating an underground storage tank.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Financial responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Financial responsibility required by this subsection may be established in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator by any one, or any combination, of the <!-- PDFPage:4862 -->following: insurance, guarantee, surety bond, letter of credit, qualification as a self-insurer or any other method satisfactory to the Administrator. In promulgating requirements under this subsection, the Administrator is authorized to specify policy or other contractual terms, conditions, or defenses which are necessary or are unacceptable in establishing such evidence of financial responsibility in order to effectuate the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case where the owner or operator is in bankruptcy, reorganization, or arrangement pursuant to the Federal Bankruptcy Code or where with reasonable diligence jurisdiction in any State court of the Federal courts cannot be obtained over an owner or operator likely to be solvent at the time of judgment, any claim arising from conduct for which evidence of financial responsibility must be provided under this subsection may be asserted directly against the guarantor providing such evidence of financial responsibility. In the case of any action pursuant to this paragraph such guarantor shall be entitled to invoke all rights and defenses which would have been available to the owner or operator if any action had been brought against the owner or operator by the claimant and which would have been available to the guarantor if an action had been brought against the guarantor by the owner or operator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The total liability of any guarantor shall be limited to the aggregate amount which the guarantor has provided as evidence of financial responsibility to the owner or operator under this section. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit any other State or Federal statutory, contractual or common law liability of a guarantor to its owner or operator including, but not limited to, the liability of such guarantor for bad faith either in negotiating or in failing to negotiate the settlement of any claim. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to diminish the liability of any person under section 9607 or 9611 of this title or other applicable law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purpose of this subsection, the term &ldquo;guarantor&rdquo; means any person, other than the owner or operator, who provides evidence of financial responsibility for an owner or operator under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Administrator, in promulgating financial responsibility regulations under this section, may establish an amount of coverage for particular classes or categories of underground storage tanks containing petroleum which shall satisfy such regulations and which shall not be less than $1,000,000 for each occurrence with an appropriate aggregate requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator may set amounts lower than the amounts required by subparagraph (A) of this paragraph for underground storage tanks containing petroleum which are at facilities not engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing and which are not used to handle substantial quantities of petroleum.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In establishing classes and categories for purposes of this paragraph, the Administrator may consider the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The size, type, location, storage, and handling capacity of underground storage tanks in the class or category and the volume of petroleum handled by such tanks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The likelihood of release and the potential extent of damage from any release from underground storage tanks in the class or category.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The economic impact of the limits on the owners and operators of each such class or category, particularly relating to the small business segment of the petroleum marketing industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The availability of methods of financial responsibility in amounts greater than the amount established by this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Such other factors as the Administrator deems pertinent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Administrator may suspend enforcement of the financial responsibility requirements for a particular class or category of underground storage tanks or in a particular State, if the Administrator makes a determination that methods of financial responsibility satisfying the requirements of this subsection are not generally available for underground storage tanks in that class or category, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) steps are being taken to form a risk retention group for such class of tanks; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such State is taking steps to establish a fund pursuant to section 6991c(c)(1) of this title to be submitted as evidence of financial responsibility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A suspension by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph shall extend for a period not to exceed 180 days. A determination to suspend may be made with respect to the same class or category or for the same State at the end of such period, but only if substantial progress has been made in establishing a risk retention group, or the owners or operators in the class or category demonstrate, and the Administrator finds, that the formation of such a group is not possible and that the State is unable or unwilling to establish such a fund pursuant to clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) New tank performance standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall, not later than three months prior to the effective date specified in subsection (f) of this section, issue performance standards for underground storage tanks brought into use on or after the effective date of such standards. The performance standards for new underground storage tanks shall include, but need not be limited to, design, construction, installation, release detection, and compatibility standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effective dates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations issued pursuant to subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6991b_1_target" name="6991b_1">1</a></sup> (c) and (d) of this section, and standards issued pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, for underground storage tanks containing regulated substances defined in section 6991(2)(B) of this title (petroleum, including crude oil or any fraction thereof which is liquid at standard conditions of temperature and pressure) shall be effective not later than thirty months after November 8, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Standards issued pursuant to subsection (e) of this section (entitled &ldquo;New Tank Perform<!-- PDFPage:4863 -->ance Standards&rdquo;) for underground storage tanks containing regulated substances defined in section 6991(2)(A) of this title shall be effective not later than thirty-six months after November 8, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations issued pursuant to subsection (c) of this section (entitled &ldquo;Requirements&rdquo;) and standards issued pursuant to subsection (d) of this section (entitled &ldquo;Financial Responsibility&rdquo;) for underground storage tanks containing regulated substances defined in section 6991(2)(A) of this title shall be effective not later than forty-eight months after November 8, 1984.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Interim prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Until the effective date of the standards promulgated by the Administrator under subsection (e) of this section and after one hundred and eighty days after November 8, 1984, no person may install an underground storage tank for the purpose of storing regulated substances unless such tank (whether of single or double wall construction)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will prevent releases due to corrosion or structural failure for the operational life of the tank;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is cathodically protected against corrosion, constructed of noncorrosive material, steel clad with a noncorrosive material, or designed in a manner to prevent the release or threatened release of any stored substance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the material used in the construction or lining of the tank is compatible with the substance to be stored.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), if soil tests conducted in accordance with ASTM Standard G57&ndash;78, or another standard approved by the Administrator, show that soil resistivity in an installation location is 12,000 ohm/cm or more (unless a more stringent standard is prescribed by the Administrator by rule), a storage tank without corrosion protection may be installed in that location during the period referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) EPA response program for petroleum</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Before regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the effective date of regulations under subsection (c) of this section, the Administrator (or a State pursuant to paragraph (7)) is authorized to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require the owner or operator of an underground storage tank to undertake corrective action with respect to any release of petroleum when the Administrator (or the State) determines that such corrective action will be done properly and promptly by the owner or operator of the underground storage tank from which the release occurs; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) undertake corrective action with respect to any release of petroleum into the environment from an underground storage tank if such action is necessary, in the judgment of the Administrator (or the State), to protect human health and the environment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The corrective action undertaken or required under this paragraph shall be such as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment. The Administrator shall use funds in the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for payment of costs incurred for corrective action under subparagraph (B), enforcement action under subparagraph (A), and cost recovery under paragraph (6) of this subsection. Subject to the priority requirements of paragraph (3), the Administrator (or the State) shall give priority in undertaking such actions under subparagraph (B) to cases where the Administrator (or the State) cannot identify a solvent owner or operator of the tank who will undertake action properly.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) After regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Following the effective date of regulations under subsection (c) of this section, all actions or orders of the Administrator (or a State pursuant to paragraph (7)) described in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be in conformity with such regulations. Following such effective date, the Administrator (or the State) may undertake corrective action with respect to any release of petroleum into the environment from an underground storage tank only if such action is necessary, in the judgment of the Administrator (or the State), to protect human health and the environment and one or more of the following situations exists:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) No person can be found, within 90 days or such shorter period as may be necessary to protect human health and the environment, who is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an owner or operator of the tank concerned,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) subject to such corrective action regulations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) capable of carrying out such corrective action properly.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A situation exists which requires prompt action by the Administrator (or the State) under this paragraph to protect human health and the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Corrective action costs at a facility exceed the amount of coverage required by the Administrator pursuant to the provisions of subsections (c) and (d)(5) of this section and, considering the class or category of underground storage tank from which the release occurred, expenditures from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund are necessary to assure an effective corrective action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The owner or operator of the tank has failed or refused to comply with an order of the Administrator under this subsection or section 6991e of this title or with the order of a State under this subsection to comply with the corrective action regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Priority of corrective actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator (or a State pursuant to paragraph (7)) shall give priority in undertaking corrective actions under this subsection, and in issuing orders requiring owners or operators to undertake such actions, to releases of petroleum from underground storage tanks which pose the greatest threat to human health and the environment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Corrective action orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator is authorized to issue orders to the owner or operator of an under<!-- PDFPage:4864 -->ground storage tank to carry out subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) or to carry out regulations issued under subsection (c)(4) of this section. A State acting pursuant to paragraph (7) of this subsection is authorized to carry out subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) only until the State's program is approved by the Administrator under section 6991c of this title. Such orders shall be issued and enforced in the same manner and subject to the same requirements as orders under section 6991e of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Allowable corrective actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The corrective actions undertaken by the Administrator (or a State pursuant to paragraph (7)) under paragraph (1) or (2) may include temporary or permanent relocation of residents and alternative household water supplies. In connection with the performance of any corrective action under paragraph (1) or (2), the Administrator may undertake an exposure assessment as defined in paragraph (10) of this subsection or provide for such an assessment in a cooperative agreement with a State pursuant to paragraph (7) of this subsection. The costs of any such assessment may be treated as corrective action for purposes of paragraph (6), relating to cost recovery.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Recovery of costs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Whenever costs have been incurred by the Administrator, or by a State pursuant to paragraph (7), for undertaking corrective action or enforcement action with respect to the release of petroleum from an underground storage tank, the owner or operator of such tank shall be liable to the Administrator or the State for such costs. The liability under this paragraph shall be construed to be the standard of liability which obtains under section 1321 of title 33.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the equities for seeking the recovery of costs under subparagraph (A), the Administrator (or a State pursuant to paragraph (7) of this subsection) may consider the amount of financial responsibility required to be maintained under subsections (c) and (d)(5) of this section and the factors considered in establishing such amount under subsection (d)(5) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effect on liability</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) No transfers of liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No indemnification, hold harmless, or similar agreement or conveyance shall be effective to transfer from the owner or operator of any underground storage tank or from any person who may be liable for a release or threat of release under this subsection, to any other person the liability imposed under this subsection. Nothing in this subsection shall bar any agreement to insure, hold harmless, or indemnify a party to such agreement for any liability under this section.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) No bar to cause of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Nothing in this subsection, including the provisions of clause (i) of this subparagraph, shall bar a cause of action that an owner or operator or any other person subject to liability under this section, or a guarantor, has or would have, by reason of subrogation or otherwise against any person.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;facility&rdquo; means, with respect to any owner or operator, all underground storage tanks used for the storage of petroleum which are owned or operated by such owner or operator and located on a single parcel of property (or on any contiguous or adjacent property).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) State authorities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State may exercise the authorities in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, subject to the terms and conditions of paragraphs (3), (5), (9), (10), and (11), and including the authorities of paragraphs (4), (6), and (8) of this subsection if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Administrator determines that the State has the capabilities to carry out effective corrective actions and enforcement activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Administrator enters into a cooperative agreement with the State setting out the actions to be undertaken by the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Administrator may provide funds from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund for the reasonable costs of the State's actions under the cooperative agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Cost share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Following the effective date of the regulations under subsection (c) of this section, the State shall pay 10 per centum of the cost of corrective actions undertaken either by the Administrator or by the State under a cooperative agreement, except that the Administrator may take corrective action at a facility where immediate action is necessary to respond to an imminent and substantial endangerment to human health or the environment if the State fails to pay the cost share.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Emergency procurement powers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Administrator may authorize the use of such emergency procurement powers as he deems necessary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Definition of owner or operator</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As used in this subchapter, the terms &ldquo;owner&rdquo; and &ldquo;operator&rdquo; do not include a person that, without participating in the management of an underground storage tank and otherwise not engaged in petroleum production, refining, or marketing, holds indicia of ownership primarily to protect the person's security interest.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Security interest holders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The provisions regarding holders of security interests in subparagraphs (E) through (G) of section 9601(20) of this title and the <!-- PDFPage:4865 -->provisions regarding fiduciaries at section 9607(n) of this title shall apply in determining a person's liability as an owner or operator of an underground storage tank for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effect on rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in subparagraph (B) shall be construed as modifying or affecting the final rule issued by the Administrator on September 7, 1995 (60 Fed. Reg. 46,692), or as limiting the authority of the Administrator to amend the final rule, in accordance with applicable law. The final rule in effect on September 30, 1996, shall prevail over any inconsistent provision regarding holders of security interests in subparagraphs (E) through (G) of section 9601(20) of this title or any inconsistent provision regarding fiduciaries in section 9607(n) of this title. Any amendment to the final rule shall be consistent with the provisions regarding holders of security interests in subparagraphs (E) through (G) of section 9601(20) of this title and the provisions regarding fiduciaries in section 9607(n) of this title. This subparagraph does not preclude judicial review of any amendment of the final rule made after September 30, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Definition of exposure assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;exposure assessment&rdquo; means an assessment to determine the extent of exposure of, or potential for exposure of, individuals to petroleum from a release from an underground storage tank based on such factors as the nature and extent of contamination and the existence of or potential for pathways of human exposure (including ground or surface water contamination, air emissions, and food chain contamination), the size of the community within the likely pathways of exposure, and the comparison of expected human exposure levels to the short-term and long-term health effects associated with identified contaminants and any available recommended exposure or tolerance limits for such contaminants. Such assessment shall not delay corrective action to abate immediate hazards or reduce exposure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Facilities without financial responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any facility where the owner or operator has failed to maintain evidence of financial responsibility in amounts at least equal to the amounts established by subsection (d)(5)(A) of this section (or a lesser amount if such amount is applicable to such facility as a result of subsection (d)(5)(B) of this section) for whatever reason the Administrator shall expend no monies from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund to clean up releases at such facility pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection. At such facilities the Administrator shall use the authorities provided in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) and paragraph (4) of this subsection and section 6991e of this title to order corrective action to clean up such releases. States acting pursuant to paragraph (7) of this subsection shall use the authorities provided in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) and paragraph (4) of this subsection to order corrective action to clean up such releases. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph, the Administrator may use monies from the fund to take the corrective actions authorized by paragraph (5) of this subsection to protect human health at such facilities and shall seek full recovery of the costs of all such actions pursuant to the provisions of paragraph (6)(A) of this subsection and without consideration of the factors in paragraph (6)(B) of this subsection. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Administrator (or a State pursuant to paragraph (7) of this subsection) from taking corrective action at a facility where there is no solvent owner or operator or where immediate action is necessary to respond to an imminent and substantial endangerment of human health or the environment.</p>
