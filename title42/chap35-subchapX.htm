<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide that any legal or ombudsman services made available to older individuals who are Indians represented by the tribal organization will be substantially in compliance with the provisions of subchapter III of this chapter relating to the furnishing of similar services;</p>

The Assistant Secretary shall consult with such applicants in establishing appropriate waivers and exemptions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Assistant Secretary shall approve any application that complies with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, except that in determining whether an application complies with the requirements of subsection (a)(8) of this section, the Assistant Secretary shall provide maximum flexibility to an applicant that seeks to take into account subsistence needs, local customs, and other characteristics that are appropriate to the unique cultural, regional, and geographic needs of the Indian populations to be served.</p>
