<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security finds that more or less than the correct amount of payment has been made to any person under this subchapter, proper adjustment or recovery shall be made, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) With respect to payment to a person of more than the correct amount, the Commissioner of Social Security shall decrease any payment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under this subchapter to which the overpaid person (if a qualified individual) is entitled, or shall require the overpaid person or his or her estate to refund the amount in excess of the correct amount, or, if recovery is not obtained under these two methods, shall seek or pursue recovery by means of reduction in tax refunds based on notice to the Secretary of the Treasury, as authorized under section 3720A of title 31; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under subchapter II of this chapter to recover the amount in excess of the correct amount, if the person is not currently eligible for payment under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) With respect to payment of less than the correct amount to a qualified individual who, at the time the Commissioner of Social Security is prepared to take action with respect to the underpayment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is living, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make payment to the qualified individual (or the qualified individual's representative payee designated under section 1007 of this title) of the balance of the amount due the underpaid qualified individual; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is deceased, the balance of the amount due shall revert to the general fund of the Treasury.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) become qualified for benefits under this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such individual is otherwise so qualified, become qualified for increased benefits under this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which more than the correct amount of payment has been made, there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery by the United States from, any person who is without fault if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limited immunity for disbursing officers</h4>
