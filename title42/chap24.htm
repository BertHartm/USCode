<p class="statutory-body">The Commission may, but shall not be required to, classify any other real property at or in the vicinity of the community, whether within or outside of that community.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Residential structures within each community</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the date any residential property is first offered for sale at Los Alamos, the Commission shall further classify each residential structure within the community of Los Alamos either as a single family house, a duplex house, an apartment house, a dormitory, or as a residential structure containing two or more separate single family units and shall post, at the offices of the Commission at Los Alamos, a list, available for public inspection at reasonable times, showing the classification of each such residential structure. For the purposes of this chapter, each such residential structure will thereafter be deemed to be a single family house, a duplex house, an apartment house, a dormitory, or a residential structure containing two or more separate single family units in accordance with its classification. In determining the classification of each such residential structure containing two or more single family units, the Commission shall consider (1) the practicability of selling separately the single family units, and (2) the insurability of mortgages under section 1715n(a) of title 12.</p>

The 15 per centum deduction specified by section 2325(a) of this title, the deduction provided by section 2326(d) of this title, the financing provisions of section 2362 of this title, and the indemnity provided by sections 2363 to 2366 of this title shall be applicable to such priority sales of apartment houses. Priority interests granted by the Commission under this section shall be transferable as the Commission may by rule or regulation prescribe, but no priority right to purchase shall be transferred except as provided by section 2333 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Leasing arrangements by non-participants in apartment house sales; assumption of lessor's obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any occupant who does not participate in the purchase of an apartment house with respect to which a priority right to purchase has been granted shall be entitled, at the time of sale by the Commission, to a lease for occupancy of his housing unit for a period not to exceed fifteen months from the date the property was first offered for sale: <em>Provided</em>, That the occupant makes application for such a lease within 30 days of the grant of such priority to purchase. In selling any apartment house with respect to which lease executed under this section is in effect, the Commission is authorized to provide for the purchaser to assume any or all obligations of the lessor. The Commission in such event shall guarantee the lessee's performance of the lease.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility to participate in priority purchase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Persons who have purchased, either individually or jointly with other persons, a single-family house or duplex house (or a single-family unit in a duplex house) at Los Alamos pursuant to a priority right under this chapter shall not be eligible to participate in the priority purchase of an apartment house.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will suffer a tax loss or lapse in place of which it will not receive any other adequate revenues until the new governmental entities contemplated by this subchapter are receiving their normal taxes and performing their normal functions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payments for special burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments made under this section shall be payments made for special burdens imposed on the local governmental entities in accordance with the second sentence of section 2208 of this title.

If the recommendation under the preceding sentence regarding the Los Alamos School Board or the county of Los Alamos, New Mexico, indicates a need for further assistance for the school board or the county, as the case may be, after June 30, 1997, the recommendation shall include a report and plan describing the actions required to eliminate the need for further assistance for the school board or the county, including a proposal for legislative action to carry out the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction or termination of assistance payments; determination by Administrator of financial self-sufficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In exercising the authority of subsection (a) of this section the Administrator shall assure that the governmental or other entities receiving assistance hereunder utilize all reasonable, available means to achieve financial self-sufficiency to the end that assistance payments by the Administrator may be reduced or terminated at the earliest practical time.</p>
