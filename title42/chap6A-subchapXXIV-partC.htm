<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes of grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specification of early intervention services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The early intervention services referred to in paragraph (1) are&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inclusion of certain amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In making a determination of the amount of non-Federal contributions made by a State for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall, subject to subparagraph (B), include any non-Federal contributions provided by the State for HIV-related services, without regard to whether the contributions are made for programs established pursuant to this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome reported and confirmed for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for any fiscal year shall be deemed to be less than 1 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Diminished State contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a State that does not make available the entire amount of the non-Federal contribution referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the State shall continue to be eligible to receive Federal funds under a grant under section 300ff&ndash;41 of this title, except that the Secretary in providing Federal funds under the grant shall provide such funds (in accordance with the ratios prescribed in paragraph (1)) only with respect to the amount of funds contributed by such State.</p>
