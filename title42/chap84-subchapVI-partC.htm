<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to enter into and perform such contracts, leases, cooperative agreements, or other similar transactions with public agencies and private organizations and persons, and to make such payments (in lump sum or installments, and by way of advance or reimbursement) as he may deem to be necessary or appropriate to carry out functions now or hereafter vested in the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on authority; appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no authority to enter into contracts or to make payments under this subchapter shall be effective except to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms of lease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section may not be for a term of more than 10 years, except that the Secretary may enter into a lease that includes an option to renew for a term of more than 10 years if the Secretary determines that entering into such a lease will promote the national security or be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section may provide for the payment (in cash or in kind) by the lessee of consideration in an amount that is less than the fair market rental value of the leasehold interest.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Environmental concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before entering into a lease under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (with respect to property located on a site on the National Priorities List) or the appropriate State official (with respect to property located on a site that is not <!-- PDFPage:6142 -->listed on the National Priorities List) to determine whether the environmental conditions of the property are such that leasing the property, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, are consistent with safety and the protection of public health and the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before entering into a lease under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall obtain the concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the appropriate State official, as the case may be, in the determination required under paragraph (1).

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Retention and use of rentals; report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent provided in advance in appropriations Acts, the Secretary may retain and use money rentals received by the Secretary directly from a lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section in any amount the Secretary considers necessary to cover the administrative expenses of the lease, the maintenance and repair of the leased property, or environmental restoration activities at the facility where the leased property is located. Amounts retained under this subsection shall be retained in a separate fund established in the Treasury for such purpose. The Secretary shall annually submit to the Congress a report on amounts retained and amounts used under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In applying section 2371 of title 10 to the Secretary under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A transaction under paragraph (1) shall relate to a research, development, or demonstration project only if the Secretary determines in writing that the use of a standard contract, grant, or cooperative agreement for the project is not feasible or appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may protect from disclosure, for up to 5 years after the date on which the information is developed, any information developed pursuant to a transaction under paragraph (1) that would be protected from disclosure under section 552(b)(4) of title 5, if obtained from a person other than a Federal agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall issue guidelines for transactions under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The guidelines shall be published in the Federal Register for public comment in accordance with rulemaking procedures of the Department.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;nontraditional Government contractor&rdquo; has the meaning given the term &ldquo;nontraditional defense contractor&rdquo; in section 845(f) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103&ndash;160; 10 U.S.C. 2371 note).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 1 year after the date on which the final guidelines are published under paragraph (6), the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit to Congress a report describing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the use by the Department of authorities under this section, including the ability to attract nontraditional Government contractors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) whether additional safeguards are necessary to carry out the authorities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Property rights in inventions and discoveries; timely determination; reports to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever any contractor makes an invention or discovery to which the title vests in the Department of Energy pursuant to exercise of section 202(a)(ii) or (iv) of title 35, or pursuant to section 2182 of this title or section 5908 of this title in the course of or under any Government contract or subcontract of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program or the nuclear weapons programs or other atomic energy defense activities of the Department of Energy and the contractor requests waiver of any or all of the Government's property rights, the Secretary of Energy may decide to waive the Government's rights and assign the rights in such invention or discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such decision shall be made within 150 days after the date on which a complete request for waiver of such rights has been submitted to the Secretary by the contractor.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7274p. Advice to President and Congress regarding safety, security, and reliability of United States nuclear weapons stockpile</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility as a deterrent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States is prohibited by section 507 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102&ndash;377; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> from conducting underground nuclear tests &ldquo;unless a foreign state conducts a nuclear test after this date, at which time the prohibition on United States nuclear testing is lifted&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100&ndash;456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> requires the Secretary of Energy to &ldquo;establish and support a program to assure that the United States is in a position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban on nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and ratified.&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6158 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> (Public Law 103&ndash;160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note) required the President to submit an annual report to Congress which sets forth &ldquo;any concerns with respect to the safety, security, effectiveness, or reliability of existing United States nuclear weapons raised by the Stockpile Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that &ldquo;to assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under a test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of our weapons&rdquo;. This decision was incorporated in a Presidential Directive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103&ndash;160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> also requires that the Secretary of Energy establish a &ldquo;stewardship program to ensure the preservation of the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. The ability of the United States to maintain and certify the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without testing will require utilization of new and sophisticated computational capabilities and diagnostic technologies, methods, and procedures. Current diagnostic technologies and laboratory testing techniques are insufficient to certify the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile into the future. Whereas in the past laboratory and diagnostic tools were used in conjunction with nuclear testing, in the future they will provide, under the Department of Energy's stockpile stewardship plan, the sole basis for assessing past test data and for making judgments on phenomena observed in connection with the aging of the stockpile.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Section 3159 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104&ndash;201; 42 U.S.C. 7274<em>o</em>) requires that the directors of the nuclear weapons laboratories and the nuclear weapons production plants submit a report to the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs if they identify a problem that has significant bearing on confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon type, that the Assistant Secretary must transmit that report, along with any comments, to the congressional defense committees and to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense, and that the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council advise Congress regarding its analysis of any such problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed &ldquo;the establishment of a new annual reporting and certification requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable under a comprehensive test ban&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) On the same day, the President noted that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the responsibility, after being &ldquo;advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, and the Commander of United States Strategic Command&rdquo;, to provide the President with the information regarding the certification referred to in paragraph (10).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by section 179 of title 10 is responsible for providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including &ldquo;considering safety, security, and control issues for existing weapons&rdquo;. The Council plays a critical role in advising Congress in matters relating to nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) It is essential that the President receive well-informed, objective, and honest opinions, including dissenting views, from his advisers and technical experts regarding the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to maintain a safe, secure, effective, and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as long as other nations control or actively seek to acquire nuclear weapons, to retain a credible nuclear deterrent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nuclear weapons stockpile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is in the security interest of the United States to sustain the United States nuclear weapons stockpile through a program of stockpile stewardship, carried out at the nuclear weapons laboratories and nuclear weapons production plants.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the United States should retain a triad of strategic nuclear forces sufficient to deter any future hostile foreign leadership with access to strategic nuclear forces from acting against the vital interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the United States should continue to maintain nuclear forces of sufficient size and capability to implement an effective and robust deterrent strategy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the advice of the persons required to provide the President and Congress with assurances of the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the nuclear weapons force should be scientifically based, without regard for politics, and of the highest quality and integrity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c), (d) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Advice and opinions regarding nuclear weapons stockpile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to a director of a nuclear weapons laboratory or a nuclear weapons production plant (under section 3159 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104&ndash;201; 42 U.S.C. 7274<em>o</em>)),<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> any member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council or the commander of the United States Strategic Command may also submit to the President, the <!-- PDFPage:6159 -->Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Energy, or the congressional defense committees advice or opinion regarding the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Expression of individual views</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A representative of the President may not take any action against, or otherwise constrain, a director of a nuclear weapons laboratory or a nuclear weapons production plant, a member of the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council, or the Commander of United States Strategic Command for presenting individual views to the President, the National Security Council, or Congress regarding the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7276b. Integrated resource plans</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Review by Western Area Power Administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Administrator shall, by regulation, revise the Final Amended Guidelines and Acceptance Criteria for Customer Conservation and Renewable Energy Programs published in the Federal Register on August 21, 1985 (50 F.R. 33892), or any subsequent amendments thereto, to require each customer to submit an integrated resource plan to the Administrator within 12 months after such regulations are amended. The regulation shall require a revision of such plan to be submitted every 5 years after the initial submission. The Administrator shall review the initial plan in accordance with a schedule established by the Administrator (which schedule will provide for the review of all initial plans within 24 months after such regulations are amended), and each revision thereof within 120 days after his receipt of the plan or revision and determine whether the customer has in the development of the plan or revision, complied with sections 7275 to 7276c of this title. Plan amendments may be submitted to the Administrator at any time and the Administrator shall review each such amendment within 120 days after receipt thereof to determine whether the customer in amending its plan has complied with sections 7275 to 7276c of this title. If the Administrator determines that the customer, in developing its plan, revision, or amendment, has not complied with the requirements of sections 7275 to 7276c of this title, the customer shall resubmit the plan at any time thereafter. Whenever a plan or revision or amendment is resubmitted the Administrator shall review the plan or revision or amendment within 120 days after his receipt thereof to determine whether the customer has complied with sections 7275 to 7276c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria for approval of integrated resource plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall approve an integrated resource plan submitted as required under subsection (a) of this section if, in developing the plan, the customer has:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Identified and accurately compared all practicable energy efficiency and energy supply resource options available to the customer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Included a 2-year action plan and a 5-year action plan which describe specific actions the customer will take to implement its integrated resource plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Designated &ldquo;least-cost options&rdquo; to be utilized by the customer for the purpose of providing reliable electric service to its retail consumers and explained the reasons why such options were selected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the extent practicable, minimized adverse environmental effects of new resource acquisitions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In preparation and development of the plan (and each revision or amendment of the plan) has provided for full public participation, including participation by governing boards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Included load forecasting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Provided methods of validating predicted performance in order to determine whether objectives in the plan are being met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Met such other criteria as the Administrator shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of other integrated resource plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a customer or group of customers are implementing integrated resource planning under a program responding to Federal, State, or other initiatives, including integrated resource planning considered and implemented pursuant to section 2621(d) of title 16, in evaluating that customer's integrated resource plan under sections 7275 to 7276c of this title, the Administrator shall accept such plan as fulfillment of the requirements of sections 7275 to 7276c of this title to the extent such plan substantially complies with the requirements of sections 7275 to 7276c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compliance with integrated resource plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Administrator shall, by regulation, revise the Final Amended Guidelines and Acceptance Criteria for Customer Conservation and Renewable Energy Programs published in the Federal Register on August 21, 1985 (50 F.R. 33892), or any subsequent amendments thereto, to require each customer to fully comply with the applicable integrated resource plan and submit an annual report to the Administrator (in such form and containing such information as the Administrator may require) describing the customer's progress to the goals established in such plan. After the initial review under subsection (a) of this section the Administrator shall periodically conduct reviews of a representative sample of applicable integrated resource plans and the customer's implementation of the applicable integrated resource plan to determine if the cus<!-- PDFPage:6162 -->tomers are in compliance with their plans. If the Administrator finds a customer out-of-compliance, the Administrator shall impose a surcharge under this section on all electric energy purchased by the customer from the Western Area Power Administration or reduce such customer's power allocation by 10 percent, unless the Administrator finds that a good faith effort has been made to comply with the approved plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No approved plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an integrated resource plan for any customer is not submitted before the date 12 months after the guidelines are amended as required under this section or if the plan is disapproved by the Administrator and a revised plan is not resubmitted by the date 9 months after the date of such disapproval, the Administrator shall impose a surcharge of 10 percent of the purchase price on all power obtained by that customer from the Western Area Power Administration after such date. The surcharge shall remain in effect until an integrated resource plan is approved for that customer. If the plan is not submitted for more than one year after the required date, the surcharge shall increase to 20 percent for the second year (or any portion thereof prior to approval of the plan) and to 30 percent thereafter until the plan is submitted or the contract for the purchase of power by such customer from the Western Area Power Administration terminates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Failure to comply with approved plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After approval by the Administrator of an applicable integrated resource plan for any customer, the Administrator shall impose a 10 percent surcharge on all power purchased by such customer from the Western Area Power Administration whenever the Administrator determines that such customer's activities are not consistent with the applicable integrated resource plan. The surcharge shall remain in effect until the Administrator determines that the customer's activities are consistent with the applicable integrated resource plan. The surcharge shall be increased to 20 percent if the customer's activities are out of compliance for more than one year and to 30 percent after more than 2 years, except that no surcharge shall be imposed if the customer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that a good faith effort has been made to comply with the approved plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduction in power allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any customer subject to a surcharge under paragraph (1) or (2), in lieu of imposing such surcharge the Administrator may reduce such customer's power allocation from the Western Area Power Administration by 10 percent. The Administrator shall provide by regulation the terms and conditions under which a power allocation terminated under this subsection may be reinstated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Integrated resource planning cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With the approval of the Administrator, customers within any State or region may form integrated resource planning cooperatives for the purposes of complying with sections 7275 to 7276c of this title, and such customers shall be allowed an additional 6 months to submit an initial integrated resource plan to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Customers with more than 1 contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If more than one long-term firm power service contract exists between the Administrator and a customer, only one integrated resource plan shall be required for that customer under sections 7275 to 7276c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Program review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after January 1, 1999, and at appropriate intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall initiate a public process to review the program established by this section. The Administrator is authorized at that time to revise the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this section to reflect changes, if any, in technology, needs, or other developments.</p>
