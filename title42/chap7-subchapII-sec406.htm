<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Recognition of representatives; fees for representation before Commissioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe rules and regulations governing recognition of agents or other persons, other than attorneys as hereinafter provided, representing claimants before the Commissioner of Social Security, and may require of such agents or other persons, before being recognized as representatives of claimants that they shall show that they are of good character and in good repute, possessed of the necessary qualifications to enable them to render such claimants valuable service, and otherwise competent to advise and assist such claimants in the presentation of their cases. An attorney in good standing who is admitted to practice before the highest court of the State, Territory, District, or insular possession of his residence or before the Supreme Court of the United States or the inferior Federal courts, shall be entitled to represent claimants before the Commissioner of Social Security. The Commissioner of Social Security may, after due notice and opportunity for hearing, suspend or prohibit from further practice before the Commissioner any such person, agent, or attorney who refuses to comply with the Commissioner's rules and regulations or who violates any provision of this section for which a penalty is prescribed. The Commissioner of Social Security may, by rule and regulation, prescribe the maximum fees which may be charged for services performed in connection with any claim before the Commissioner of Social Security under this subchapter, and any agreement in violation of such rules and regulations shall be void. Except as provided in paragraph (2)(A), whenever the Commissioner of Social Security, in any claim before the Commissioner for benefits under this subchapter, makes a determination favorable to the claimant, the Commissioner shall, if the claimant was represented by an attorney in connection with such claim, fix (in accordance with the regulations prescribed pursuant to the preceding sentence) a reasonable fee to compensate such attorney for the services performed by him in connection with such claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of a claim of entitlement to past-due benefits under this subchapter, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an agreement between the claimant and another person regarding any fee to be recovered by such person to compensate such person for services with respect to the claim is presented in writing to the Commissioner of Social Security prior to the time of the Commissioner's determination regarding the claim,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the fee specified in the agreement does not exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) 25 percent of the total amount of such past-due benefits (as determined before any applicable reduction under section 1320a&ndash;6(a) of this title), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) $4,000, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the determination is favorable to the claimant,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the Commissioner of Social Security shall approve that agreement at the time of the favorable determination, and (subject to paragraph (3)) the fee specified in the agreement shall be the maximum fee. The Commissioner of Social Security may from time to time increase the dollar amount under clause (ii)(II) to the extent that the rate of increase in such amount, as determined over the period since January 1, 1991, does not at any time exceed the rate of increase in primary insurance amounts under section 415(i) of this title since such date. The Commissioner of Social Security shall publish any such increased amount in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;past-due benefits&rdquo; excludes any benefits with respect to which payment has been continued pursuant to subsection (g) or (h) of section 423 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any case involving&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an agreement described in subparagraph (A) with any person relating to both a claim of entitlement to past-due benefits under this subchapter and a claim of entitlement to past-due benefits under subchapter XVI of this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a favorable determination made by the Commissioner of Social Security with respect to both such claims,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commissioner of Social Security may approve such agreement only if the total fee or fees specified in such agreement does not exceed, in the aggregate, the dollar amount in effect under subparagraph (A)(ii)(II).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of a claim with respect to which the Commissioner of Social Security has approved an agreement pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Commissioner of Social Security shall provide the claimant and the person representing the claimant a written notice of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the dollar amount of the past-due benefits (as determined before any applicable reduction under section 1320a&ndash;6(a) of this title) and the dollar amount of the past-due benefits payable to the claimant,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the dollar amount of the maximum fee which may be charged or recovered as determined under this paragraph, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a description of the procedures for review under paragraph (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commissioner of Social Security shall provide by regulation for review of the amount which would otherwise be the maximum fee as determined under paragraph (2) if, within 15 days after receipt of the notice provided pursuant to paragraph (2)(D)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the claimant, or the administrative law judge or other adjudicator who made the favorable determination, submits a written request to the Commissioner of Social Security to reduce the maximum fee, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the person representing the claimant submits a written request to the Commissioner of Social Security to increase the maximum fee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any such review shall be conducted after providing the claimant, the person representing the claimant, and the adjudicator with reasonable notice of such request and an opportunity to submit written information in favor of or in op<!-- PDFPage:1277 -->position to such request. The adjudicator may request the Commissioner of Social Security to reduce the maximum fee only on the basis of evidence of the failure of the person representing the claimant to represent adequately the claimant's interest or on the basis of evidence that the fee is clearly excessive for services rendered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In the case of a request for review under subparagraph (A) by the claimant or by the person representing the claimant, such review shall be conducted by the administrative law judge who made the favorable determination or, if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that such administrative law judge is unavailable or if the determination was not made by an administrative law judge, such review shall be conducted by another person designated by the Commissioner of Social Security for such purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of a request by the adjudicator for review under subparagraph (A), the review shall be conducted by the Commissioner of Social Security or by an administrative law judge or other person (other than such adjudicator) who is designated by the Commissioner of Social Security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon completion of the review, the administrative law judge or other person conducting the review shall affirm or modify the amount which would otherwise be the maximum fee. Any such amount so affirmed or modified shall be considered the amount of the maximum fee which may be recovered under paragraph (2). The decision of the administrative law judge or other person conducting the review shall not be subject to further review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Subject to subsection (d) of this section, if the claimant is determined to be entitled to past-due benefits under this subchapter and the person representing the claimant is an attorney, the Commissioner of Social Security shall, notwithstanding section 405(i) of this title, certify for payment out of such past-due benefits (as determined before any applicable reduction under section 1320a&ndash;6(a) of this title) to such attorney an amount equal to so much of the maximum fee as does not exceed 25 percent of such past-due benefits (as determined before any applicable reduction under section 1320a&ndash;6(a) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any person who shall, with intent to defraud, in any manner willfully and knowingly deceive, mislead, or threaten any claimant or prospective claimant or beneficiary under this subchapter by word, circular, letter or advertisement, or who shall knowingly charge or collect directly or indirectly any fee in excess of the maximum fee, or make any agreement directly or indirectly to charge or collect any fee in excess of the maximum fee, prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall for each offense be punished by a fine not exceeding $500 or by imprisonment not exceeding one year, or both. The Commissioner of Social Security shall maintain in the electronic information retrieval system used by the Social Security Administration a current record, with respect to any claimant before the Commissioner of Social Security, of the identity of any person representing such claimant in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fees for representation before court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Whenever a court renders a judgment favorable to a claimant under this subchapter who was represented before the court by an attorney, the court may determine and allow as part of its judgment a reasonable fee for such representation, not in excess of 25 percent of the total of the past-due benefits to which the claimant is entitled by reason of such judgment, and the Commissioner of Social Security may, notwithstanding the provisions of section 405(i) of this title, but subject to subsection (d) of this section, certify the amount of such fee for payment to such attorney out of, and not in addition to, the amount of such past-due benefits. In case of any such judgment, no other fee may be payable or certified for payment for such representation except as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;past-due benefits&rdquo; excludes any benefits with respect to which payment has been continued pursuant to subsection (g) or (h) of section 423 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) amounts of past-due benefits shall be determined before any applicable reduction under section 1320a&ndash;6(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any attorney who charges, demands, receives, or collects for services rendered in connection with proceedings before a court to which paragraph (1) of this subsection is applicable any amount in excess of that allowed by the court thereunder shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction thereof shall be subject to a fine of not more than $500, or imprisonment for not more than one year, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notification of options for obtaining attorneys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner of Social Security shall notify each claimant in writing, together with the notice to such claimant of an adverse determination, of the options for obtaining attorneys to represent individuals in presenting their cases before the Commissioner of Social Security. Such notification shall also advise the claimant of the availability to qualifying claimants of legal services organizations which provide legal services free of charge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assessment on attorneys</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a fee for services is required to be certified for payment to an attorney from a claimant's past-due benefits pursuant to subsection (a)(4) or (b)(1) of this section, the Commissioner shall impose on the attorney an assessment calculated in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The amount of an assessment under paragraph (1) shall be equal to the product obtained by multiplying the amount of the representative's fee that would be required to be so certified by subsection (a)(4) or (b)(1) of this section before the application of this subsection, by the percentage specified in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The percentage specified in this subparagraph is&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1278 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for calendar years before 2001, 6.3 percent, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for calendar years after 2000, such percentage rate as the Commissioner determines is necessary in order to achieve full recovery of the costs of determining and certifying fees to attorneys from the past-due benefits of claimants, but not in excess of 6.3 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner may collect the assessment imposed on an attorney under paragraph (1) by offset from the amount of the fee otherwise required by subsection (a)(4) or (b)(1) of this section to be certified for payment to the attorney from a claimant's past-due benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prohibition on claimant reimbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An attorney subject to an assessment under paragraph (1) may not, directly or indirectly, request or otherwise obtain reimbursement for such assessment from the claimant whose claim gave rise to the assessment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Disposition of assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Assessments on attorneys collected under this subsection shall be credited to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The assessments authorized under this section shall be collected and available for obligation only to the extent and in the amount provided in advance in appropriations Acts. Amounts so appropriated are authorized to remain available until expended, for administrative expenses in carrying out this subchapter and related laws.</p>
