Each such strategy shall involve both of the following activities:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Weeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Activities, to be known as Weeding activities, which shall include promoting and coordinating a broad spectrum of community efforts (especially those of law enforcement agencies and prosecutors) to arrest, and to sanction or incarcerate, persons in that community who participate or engage in violent crime, criminal drug-related activity, and other crimes that threaten the quality of life in that community.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Seeding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Activities, to be known as Seeding activities, which shall include promoting and coordinating a broad spectrum of community efforts (such as drug abuse education, mentoring, and employment counseling) to provide&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Weed and Seed strategy proposed, adopted, or implemented by the steering committee has a high probability of improving the criminal justice system within the community and contains all the elements required by the Director; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the steering committee is capable of implementing the strategy appropriately; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the community must agree to formulate a timely and effective plan to independently sustain the strategy (or, at a minimum, a majority of the best practices of the strategy) <!-- PDFPage:4628 -->when assistance under this section is no longer available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An application for designation as a Weed-and-Seed community for purposes of subsection (a) of this section shall be submitted to the Director by the steering committee of the community in such form, and containing such information and assurances, as the Director may require.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In implementing a strategy for a community under subsection (a) of this section, the Director may make grants to that community.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A community may not receive grants under this subsection (or fall within such a community)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The requirement of subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) may be satisfied in cash or in kind; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) may be waived by the Assistant Attorney General upon a determination that the financial circumstances affecting the applicant warrant a finding that such a waiver is equitable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Supplement, not supplant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To receive a grant under this subsection, the applicant must provide assurances that the amounts received under the grant shall be used to supplement, not supplant, non-Federal funds that would otherwise be available for programs or services provided in the community.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) although research conducted abroad demonstrates that individuals with developmental disabilities are at a 4 to 10 times higher risk of becoming crime victims than those without disabilities, there have been no significant studies on this subject conducted in the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in fact, the National Crime Victim's Survey, conducted annually by the Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice, does not specifically collect data relating to crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) studies in Canada, Australia, and Great Britain consistently show that victims with developmental disabilities suffer repeated victimization because so few of the crimes against them are reported, and even when they are, there is sometimes a reluctance by police, prosecutors, and judges to rely on the testimony of a disabled individual, making individuals with developmental disabilities a target for criminal predators;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to increase public awareness of the plight of victims of crime who are individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to collect data to measure the extent of the problem of crimes against individuals with developmental disabilities; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If carrying out paragraph (1) would result in any State receiving an allocation less than 0.25 percent of the total amount (in this paragraph referred to as a &ldquo;minimum allocation State&rdquo;), then paragraph (1), as so carried out, shall not apply, and the Attorney General shall instead&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allocate 0.25 percent of the total amount to each State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) using the amount remaining after carrying out subparagraph (A), carry out paragraph (1) in a manner that excludes each minimum allocation State, including the population of and the crimes reported by such State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allocation between States and units of local government</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the amounts allocated under subsection (a) of this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 40 percent shall be for grants to be allocated under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation for State governments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Of the amounts allocated under subsection (b)(1) of this section, each State may retain for the purposes described in section 3751 of this title an amount that bears the same ratio of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) total expenditures on criminal justice by the State government in the most recently completed fiscal year to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total expenditure on criminal justice by the State government and units of local government within the State in such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Remaining amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsection (e)(1) of this section, any amounts remaining after the allocation required by paragraph (1) shall be made available to units of local government by the State for the purposes described in section 3751 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allocations to local governments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) with respect to a State (in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;local amount&rdquo;), the Attorney General shall allocate to each unit of local government an amount which bears the same ratio to such share as the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such unit to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 most recent calendar years for which such data is available bears to the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by all units of local government in the State in which the unit is located to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for such years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transitional rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Attorney General shall allocate the local amount to units of local government in the same manner that, under the Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants program in effect immediately before January 5, 2006, the reserved amount was allocated among reporting and nonreporting units of local government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annexed units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a unit of local government in the State has been annexed since the date of the collection of the data used by the Attorney General in making allocations pursuant to this section, the Attorney General shall pay the amount that would have been allocated to such unit of local government to the unit of local government that annexed it.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Attorney General certifies that a unit of local government bears more than 50 percent of the costs of prosecution or incarceration that arise with respect to part 1 violent crimes reported by a specified geographically constituent unit of local government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) but for this paragraph, the amount of funds allocated under this section to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) any one such specified geographically constituent unit of local government exceeds 150 percent of the amount allocated to the unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i); or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4656 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) more than one such specified geographically constituent unit of local government exceeds 400 percent of the amount allocated to the unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then in order to qualify for payment under this subsection, the unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i), together with any such specified geographically constituent units of local government described in clause (ii), shall submit to the Attorney General a joint application for the aggregate of funds allocated to such units of local government. Such application shall specify the amount of such funds that are to be distributed to each of the units of local government and the purposes for which such funds are to be used. The units of local government involved may establish a joint local advisory board for the purposes of carrying out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;geographically constituent unit of local government&rdquo; means a unit of local government that has jurisdiction over areas located within the boundaries of an area over which a unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i) has jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on allocations to units of local government</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maximum allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No unit of local government shall receive a total allocation under this section that exceeds such unit's total expenditures on criminal justice services for the most recently completed fiscal year for which data are available. Any amount in excess of such total expenditures shall be allocated proportionally among units of local government whose allocations under this section do not exceed their total expenditures on such services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocations under $10,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the allocation under this section to a unit of local government is less than $10,000 for any fiscal year, the direct grant to the State under subsection (c) of this section shall be increased by the amount of such allocation, to be distributed (for the purposes described in section 3751 of this title) among State police departments that provide criminal justice services to units of local government and units of local government whose allocation under this section is less than $10,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-reporting units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No allocation under this section shall be made to a unit of local government that has not reported at least three years of data on part 1 violent crimes of the Uniform Crime Reports to the Federal Bureau of Investigation within the immediately preceding 10 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Funds not used by the State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Attorney General determines, on the basis of information available during any grant period, that any allocation (or portion thereof) under this section to a State for such grant period will not be required, or that a State will be unable to qualify or receive funds under this part, or that a State chooses not to participate in the program established under this part, then such State's allocation (or portion thereof) shall be awarded by the Attorney General to units of local government, or combinations thereof, within such State, giving priority to those jurisdictions with the highest annual number of part 1 violent crimes of the Uniform Crime Reports reported by the unit of local government to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the three most recent calendar years for which such data are available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rules for Puerto Rico</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) All funds set aside for Commonwealth government</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No local allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply to Puerto Rico.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Units of local government in Louisiana</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out this section with respect to the State of Louisiana, the term &ldquo;unit of local government&rdquo; means a district attorney or a parish sheriff.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter or any other Act shall be construed to authorize any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Racial imbalance requirement restriction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to authorize the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to require, or condition the availability or amount of a grant upon the adoption by an applicant or grantee under this chapter of a percentage ratio, quota system, or other program to achieve racial balance in any criminal justice agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to deny or discontinue a grant because of the refusal of an applicant or grantee under this chapter to adopt such a ratio, system, or other program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Discrimination prohibited; notice of non-compliance; suspension and restoration of payments; hearing; civil action by Attorney General; private action, attorney fees, intervention by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No person in any State shall on the ground of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under or denied employment in connection with any programs or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Whenever there has been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) receipt of notice of a finding, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, by a Federal court (other than in an action brought by the Attorney General) or State court, or by a Federal or State administrative agency, to the effect that there has been a pattern or practice of discrimination in violation of paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a determination after an investigation by the Office of Justice Programs (prior to a hearing under subparagraph (F) but including an opportunity for the State government or unit of local government to make a documentary submission regarding the allegation of discrimination with respect to such program or activity, with funds made available under this chapter) that a State government or unit of local government is not in compliance with paragraph (1);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Office of Justice Programs shall, within ten days after such occurrence, notify the chief executive of the affected State, or the State in which the affected unit of local government is located, and the chief executive of such unit of local government, that such program or activity has been so found or determined not to be in compliance with paragraph (1), and shall request each chief executive, notified under this subparagraph with respect to such violation, to secure compliance. For purposes of clause (i) a finding by a Federal or State administrative agency shall be deemed rendered after notice and opportunity for a hearing if it is rendered pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the event the chief executive secures compliance after notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), the terms and conditions with which the affected State government or unit of local government agrees to comply shall be set forth in writing and signed by the chief executive of the State, by the chief executive of such unit (in the event of a violation by a unit of local government), and by the Office of Justice Programs. <!-- PDFPage:4669 -->On or prior to the effective date of the agreement, the Office of Justice Programs shall send a copy of the agreement to each complainant, if any, with respect to such violation. The chief executive of the State, or the chief executive of the unit (in the event of a violation by a unit of local government) shall file semiannual reports with the Office of Justice Programs detailing the steps taken to comply with the agreement. These reports shall cease to be filed upon the determination of the Office of Justice Programs that compliance has been secured, or upon the determination by a Federal or State court that such State government or local governmental unit is in compliance with this section. Within fifteen days of receipt of such reports, the Office of Justice Programs shall send a copy thereof to each such complainant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If, at the conclusion of ninety days after notification under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) compliance has not been secured by the chief executive of that State or the chief executive of that unit of local government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an administrative law judge has not made a determination under subparagraph (F) that it is likely the State government or unit of local government will prevail on the merits; the Office of Justice Programs shall notify the Attorney General that compliance has not been secured and caused to have suspended further payment of any funds under this chapter to that program or activity. Such suspension shall be limited to the specific program or activity cited by the Office of Justice Programs in the notice under subparagraph (A). Such suspension shall be effective for a period of not more than one hundred and twenty days, or, if there is a hearing under subparagraph (G), not more than thirty days after the conclusion of such hearing, unless there has been an express finding by the Office of Justice Programs, after notice and opportunity for such a hearing, that the recipient is not in compliance with paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Payment of the suspended funds shall resume only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such State government or unit of local government enters into a compliance agreement approved by the Office of Justice Programs and the Attorney General in accordance with subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such State government or unit of local government complies fully with the final order or judgment of a Federal or State court, or by a Federal or State administrative agency if that order or judgment covers all the matters raised by the Office of Justice Programs in the notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), or is found to be in compliance with paragraph (1) by such court; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) after a hearing the Office of Justice Programs pursuant to subparagraph (F) finds that noncompliance has not been demonstrated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Whenever the Attorney General files a civil action alleging a pattern or practice of discriminatory conduct on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex in any program or activity of a State government or unit of local government which State government or unit of local government receives funds made available under this chapter, and the conduct allegedly violates the provisions of this section and neither party within forty-five days after such filing has been granted such preliminary relief with regard to the suspension or payment of funds as may be otherwise available by law, the Office of Justice Programs shall cause to have suspended further payment of any funds under this chapter to that specific program or activity alleged by the Attorney General to be in violation of the provisions of this subsection until such time as the court orders resumption of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Prior to the suspension of funds under subparagraph (C), but within the ninety-day period after notification under subparagraph (C), the State government or unit of local government may request an expedited preliminary hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, in order to determine whether it is likely that the State government or unit of local government would, at a full hearing under subparagraph (G), prevail on the merits on the issue of the alleged noncompliance. A finding under this subparagraph by the administrative law judge in favor of the State government or unit of local government shall defer the suspension of funds under subparagraph (C) pending a finding of noncompliance at the conclusion of the hearing on the merits under subparagraph (G).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) At any time after notification under subparagraph (A), but before the conclusion of the one-hundred-and-twenty-day period referred to in subparagraph (C), a State government or unit of local government may request a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, which the Office of Justice Programs shall initiate within sixty days of such request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Within thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing, or, in the absence of a hearing, at the conclusion of the one-hundred-and-twenty-day period referred to in subparagraph (C), the Office of Justice Programs shall make a finding of compliance or noncompliance. If the Office of Justice Programs makes a finding of noncompliance, the Office of Justice Programs shall notify the Attorney General in order that the Attorney General may institute a civil action under paragraph (3), cause to have terminated the payment of funds under this chapter, and, if appropriate, seek repayment of such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Office of Justice Programs makes a finding of compliance, payment of the suspended funds shall resume as provided in subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H) Any State government or unit of local government aggrieved by a final determination of the Office of Justice Programs under subparagraph (G) may appeal such determination as provided in section 3785&nbsp;<sup><a href="#3789d_1_target" name="3789d_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that a State government or unit of local government has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice in violation of the provisions of this section, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in an appropriate United States district court. Such court may grant as relief any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or other order, as <!-- PDFPage:4670 -->necessary or appropriate to insure the full enjoyment of the rights described in this section, including the suspension, termination, or repayment of such funds made available under this chapter as the court may deem appropriate, or placing any further such funds in escrow pending the outcome of the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Whenever a State government or unit of local government, or any officer or employee thereof acting in an official capacity, has engaged or is engaging in any act or practice prohibited by this subsection, a civil action may be instituted after exhaustion of administrative remedies by the person aggrieved in an appropriate United States district court or in a State court of general jurisdiction. Administrative remedies shall be deemed to be exhausted upon the expiration of sixty days after the date the administrative complaint was filed with the Office of Justice Programs or any other administrative enforcement agency, unless within such period there has been a determination by the Office of Justice Programs or the agency on the merits of the complaint, in which case such remedies shall be deemed exhausted at the time the determination becomes final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any civil action brought by a private person to enforce compliance with any provision of this subsection, the court may grant to a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney fees, unless the court determines that the lawsuit is frivolous, vexatious, brought for harassment purposes, or brought principally for the purpose of gaining attorney fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any action instituted under this section to enforce compliance with paragraph (1), the Attorney General, or a specially designated assistant for or in the name of the United States, may intervene upon timely application if he certifies that the action is of general public importance. In such action the United States shall be entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;James Guelff and Chris McCurley Body Armor Act of 2002&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4733 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) nationally, police officers and ordinary citizens are facing increased danger as criminals use more deadly weaponry, body armor, and other sophisticated assault gear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) crime at the local level is exacerbated by the interstate movement of body armor and other assault gear;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is a traffic in body armor moving in or otherwise affecting interstate commerce, and existing Federal controls over such traffic do not adequately enable the States to control this traffic within their own borders through the exercise of their police power;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) recent incidents, such as the murder of San Francisco Police Officer James Guelff by an assailant wearing 2 layers of body armor, a 1997 bank shoot out in north Hollywood, California, between police and 2 heavily armed suspects outfitted in body armor, and the 1997 murder of Captain Chris McCurley of the Etowah County, Alabama Drug Task Force by a drug dealer shielded by protective body armor, demonstrate the serious threat to community safety posed by criminals who wear body armor during the commission of a violent crime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) of the approximately 1,500 officers killed in the line of duty since 1980, more than 30 percent could have been saved by body armor, and the risk of dying from gunfire is 14 times higher for an officer without a bulletproof vest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Department of Justice has estimated that 25 percent of State and local police are not issued body armor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Federal Government is well-equipped to grant local police departments access to body armor that is no longer needed by Federal agencies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Congress has the power, under the interstate commerce clause and other provisions of the Constitution of the United States, to enact legislation to regulate interstate commerce that affects the integrity and safety of our communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Body armor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;body armor&rdquo; means any product sold or offered for sale, in interstate or foreign commerce, as personal protective body covering intended to protect against gunfire, regardless of whether the product is to be worn alone or is sold as a complement to another product or garment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Law enforcement agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;law enforcement agency&rdquo; means an agency of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of criminal law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Law enforcement officer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;law enforcement officer&rdquo; means any officer, agent, or employee of the United States, a State, or a political subdivision of a State, authorized by law or by a government agency to engage in or supervise the prevention, detection, investigation, or prosecution of any violation of criminal law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amendment of sentencing guidelines with respect to body armor</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Pursuant to its authority under section 994(p) of title 28, the United States Sentencing Commission shall review and amend the Federal sentencing guidelines and the policy statements of the Commission, as appropriate, to provide an appropriate sentencing enhancement for any crime of violence (as defined in section 16 of title 18) or drug trafficking crime (as defined in section 924(c) of title 18) (including a crime of violence or drug trafficking crime that provides for an enhanced punishment if committed by the use of a deadly or dangerous weapon or device) in which the defendant used body armor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that any sentencing enhancement under this subsection should be at least 2 levels.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Donation of Federal surplus body armor</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the terms &ldquo;Federal agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;surplus property&rdquo; have the meanings given such terms under section 102 of title 40.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Donation of body armor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding sections 541&ndash;555 of title 40, the head of a Federal agency may donate body armor directly to any State or local law enforcement agency, if such body armor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is in serviceable condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is surplus property; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) meets or exceeds the requirements of National Institute of Justice Standard 0101.03 (as in effect on November 2, 2002).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice to Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The head of a Federal agency who donates body armor under this subsection shall submit to the Administrator of General Services a written notice identifying the amount of body armor donated and each State or local law enforcement agency that received the body armor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Donation by certain officers</h4>
