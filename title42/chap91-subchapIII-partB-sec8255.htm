<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body">1992&mdash;Pub. L. 102&ndash;486 amended section generally. Prior to amendment, section read as follows: &ldquo;Each agency, in support of the President's annual budget request to the Congress, shall specifically set forth and identify funds requested for energy conservation measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">1988&mdash;Pub. L. 100&ndash;615 amended section generally, substituting provision relating to budget treatment for energy conservation measures for provisions relating to establishment and use of life cycle cost methods, use of life cycle costs, and use in non-Federal structures.</p>
<p class="note-body">1986&mdash;Subsec. (a)(2). Pub. L. 99&ndash;509 substituted &ldquo;average&rdquo; for &ldquo;marginal&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1980&mdash;Subsec. (a)(1). Pub. L. 96&ndash;294, which directed amendment of par. (1) by inserting provisions setting forth criteria for establishing life-cycle costs for Federal buildings before the period at end, was executed to par. (2) as the probable intent of Congress because par. (1) does not contain a period.</p>
