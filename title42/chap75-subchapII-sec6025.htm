<p class="statutory-body">The amount of an allotment to a State for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required by the State during the period for which it is available for the purpose for which allotted shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary from time to time, on such date or dates as the Secretary may fix (but not earlier than thirty days after the Secretary has published notice of the intention of the Secretary to make such reallotment in the Federal Register), to other States with respect to which such a determination has not been made, in proportion to the original allotments of such States for such fiscal year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use during such period; and the total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount so reallotted to a State for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year.</p>
