<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National water resources planning policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States that all water resources projects should reflect national priorities, encourage economic development, and protect the environment by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) seeking to maximize sustainable economic development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) seeking to avoid the unwise use of floodplains and flood-prone areas and minimizing adverse impacts and vulnerabilities in any case in which a floodplain or flood-prone area must be used; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) protecting and restoring the functions of natural systems and mitigating any unavoidable damage to natural systems.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Principles and guidelines</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Principles and guidelines defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the term &ldquo;principles and guidelines&rdquo; means the principles and guidelines contained in the document prepared by the Water Resources Council pursuant to section 1962a&ndash;2 of this title, entitled &ldquo;Economic and Environmental Principles and Guidelines for Water and Related Land Resources Implementation Studies&rdquo;, and dated March 10, 1983.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In developing revisions to the principles and guidelines under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall evaluate the consistency of the principles and guidelines with, and ensure that the principles and guidelines address, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The use of best available economic principles and analytical techniques, including techniques in risk and uncertainty analysis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The assessment and incorporation of public safety in the formulation of alternatives and recommended plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Assessment methods that reflect the value of projects for low-income communities and projects that use nonstructural approaches to water resources development and management.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The assessment and evaluation of the interaction of a project with other water resources projects and programs within a region or watershed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The use of contemporary water resources paradigms, including integrated water resources management and adaptive management.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Evaluation methods that ensure that water resources projects are justified by public benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Consultation and public participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out paragraph (2), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consult with the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Secretary of Energy, the Secretary of Homeland Security, the National Academy of Sciences, and the Council on Environmental Quality; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the revisions to the principles and guidelines for use by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an explanation of the intent of each revision, how each revision is consistent with this section, and the probable impact of each revision on water resources projects carried out by the Secretary; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) make the revisions to the principles and guidelines for use by the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:3666 -->available to the public, including on the Internet.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the requirements of this subsection, the principles and guidelines as revised under this subsection shall apply to water resources projects carried out by the Secretary instead of the principles and guidelines for such projects in effect on the day before November 8, 2007.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the date of issuance of the revisions to the principles and guidelines, the revisions shall apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to all water resources projects carried out by the Secretary, other than projects for which the Secretary has commenced a feasibility study before the date of such issuance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at the request of a non-Federal interest, to a water resources project for which the Secretary has commenced a feasibility study before the date of such issuance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to the reevaluation or modification of a water resources project, other than a reevaluation or modification that has been commenced by the Secretary before the date of such issuance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Existing studies</h4>

This plan may provide for the construction, operation, and maintenance by the United States of (1) a system of major reservoirs to be located within those river basins of the northeastern United States which drain into the Chesapeake Bay, those that drain into the Atlantic Ocean north of the Chesapeake Bay, those that drain into Lake Ontario, and those that drain into the Saint Lawrence River, (2) major conveyance facilities by which water may be exchanged between these river basins to the extent found desirable in the national interest, and (3) major purification facilities. Such plans shall provide for appropriate financial participation by the States, political subdivisions thereof, and other local interests.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Combination of reimbursement of installation costs and reduction in contributions; single project limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, may, when he determines it to be in the public interest, enter into agreements providing for reimbursement to States or political subdivisions thereof for work to be performed by such non-Federal public bodies at water resources development projects authorized for construction under the Secretary of the Army and the supervision of the Chief of Engineers. Such agreements may provide for reimbursement of installation costs incurred by such entities or an equivalent reduction in the contributions they would otherwise be required to make, or in appropriate cases, for a combination thereof. The amount of Federal reimbursement, including reductions in contributions, for a single project shall not exceed $5,000,000 or 1 percent of the total project cost, whichever is greater; except that the amount of actual Federal reimbursement, including reductions in contributions, for such project may not exceed $7,000,000 in any fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreement provisions; termination of agreement for failure to commence work</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Agreements entered into pursuant to this section shall (1) fully describe the work to be accomplished by the non-Federal public body, and be accompanied by an engineering plan if necessary therefor; (2) specify the manner in which such work shall be carried out; (3) provide for necessary review of design and plans, and inspection of the work by the Chief of Engineers or his designee; (4) state the basis on which the amount of reimbursement shall be determined; (5) state that such reimbursement shall be dependent upon the appropriation of funds applicable thereto or funds available therefor, and shall not take precedence over other pending projects of higher priority for improvements; and (6) specify that reimbursement or credit for non-Federal installation expenditures shall apply only to work undertaken on Federal projects after project authorization and execution of the agreement, and does not apply retroactively to past non-Federal work. Each such agreement shall expire three years after the date on which it is executed if the work to be undertaken by the non-Federal public body has not commenced before the expiration of that period. The time allowed for completion of the work will be determined by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, and stated in the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification of performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No reimbursement shall be made, and no expenditure shall be credited, pursuant to this section, unless and until the Chief of Engineers or his designee, has certified that the work for which reimbursement or credit is requested has been performed in accordance with the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Beach erosion control projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursement for work commenced by non-Federal public bodies no later than one year after August 13, 1968, to carry out or assist in carrying out projects for beach erosion control, may be made in accordance with the provisions of section 426f of title 33. Reimbursement for such work may, as an alternative, be made in accordance with the provisions of this section, provided that agreement required herein shall have been executed prior to commencement of the work.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition of construction for Federal assumption of responsibilities of non-Federal bodies or for Federal liability for unnecessary or inapplicable project work of such bodies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not be construed (1) as authorizing the United States to assume any responsibilities placed upon a non-Federal body by the conditions of project authorization, or (2) as committing the United States to reimburse non-Federal interests if the Federal project is not undertaken or is modified so as to make the work performed by the non-Federal Public body no longer applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Allotment limitation for any fiscal year; specific project reimbursement authorizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Army is authorized to allot from any appropriations hereafter made for civil works, not to exceed $10,000,000 for any one fiscal year to carry out the provisions of this section.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Credit authorized under this paragraph for a project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not exceed the non-Federal share of the cost of the project;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which a specific provision of law provides for a non-Federal interest to receive credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of a study for, or construction or operation and maintenance of, a water resources project, the specific provision of law shall apply instead of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of non-Federal interest</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Great Lakes are a most important natural resource to the eight Great Lakes States and two Canadian provinces, providing water supply for domestic and industrial use, clean energy through hydropower production, an efficient transportation mode for moving products into and out of the Great Lakes region, and recreational uses for millions of United States and Canadian citizens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Great Lakes need to be carefully managed and protected to meet current and future needs within the Great Lakes basin and Canadian provinces;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any new diversions of Great Lakes water for use outside of the Great Lakes basin will have significant economic and environmental impacts, adversely affecting the use of this resource by the Great Lakes States and Canadian provinces; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) four of the Great Lakes are international waters and are defined as boundary waters in the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 between the United States and Canada, and as such any new diversion of Great Lakes water in the United States would affect the relations of the Government of the United States with the Government of Canada.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional declaration of purpose and policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore declared to be the purpose and policy of the Congress in this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to encourage the Great Lakes States, in consultation with the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, to develop and implement a mechanism that provides a common conservation standard embodying the principles of water conservation and resource improvement for making decisions concerning the withdrawal and use of water from the Great Lakes Basin;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to prohibit any diversion of Great Lakes water by any State, Federal agency, or private entity for use outside the Great Lakes basin unless such diversion is approved by the Governor of each of the Great Lakes States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to prohibit any Federal agency from undertaking any studies that would involve the transfer of Great Lakes water for any purpose for use outside the Great Lakes basin.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No water shall be diverted or exported from any portion of the Great Lakes within the United States, or from any tributary within the United States of any of the Great Lakes, for use outside the Great Lakes basin unless such diversion or export is approved by the Governor of each of the Great Lake&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1962d-20_1_target" name="1962d-20_1">1</a></sup> States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Approval of Governors for diversion studies</h4>

The prohibition of the preceding sentence shall not apply to any study or data collection effort performed by the Corps of Engineers or other Federal agency under the direction of the International Joint Commission in accordance with the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909.</p>
