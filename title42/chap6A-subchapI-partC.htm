<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where an injury or other adverse effect specified in the injury table established under section 239b of this title as a known effect of a vaccine manifests in an individual within the time period specified in such table, such injury or other effect shall be presumed to have resulted from administration of such vaccine.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making determinations other than those described in paragraph (1) as to the causation or severity of an injury, the Secretary shall employ a preponderance of the evidence standard and take into consideration all relevant medical and scientific evidence presented for consideration, and may obtain and consider the views of qualified medical experts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deadline for filing request</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish by interim final regulation a table identifying adverse effects (including injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths) that shall be presumed to result from the administration of (or exposure to) a smallpox vaccine, and the time period in which the first symptom or manifestation of onset of each such adverse effect must manifest in order for such presumption to apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may by regulation amend the table established under paragraph (1). An amendment to the table takes effect on the date of the promulgation of the final rule that makes the amendment, and applies to all requests for benefits or compensation under this part that are filed on or after such date or are pending as of such date. In addition, the amendment applies retroactively to an individual who was not with respect to the injury involved an eligible individual under the table as in effect before the amendment but who with respect to such injury is an eligible individual under the table as amended. With respect to a request for benefits or compensation under this part by an individual who becomes an eligible individual as described in the preceding sentence, the Secretary may not provide such benefits or compensation unless the request (or amendment to a request, as applicable) is filed before the expiration of one year after the effective date of the amendment to the table in the case of an individual to whom the vaccine was administered and before the expiration of two years after such effective date in the case of a request based on accidental vaccinia inoculation.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payments under paragraph (1) with respect to an eligible individual described in such paragraph shall be made as if such individual were an eligible individual to whom compensation would be paid under subsection (a) of section 239d of this title, with the rate augmented in accordance with subsection (b)(2) of such section and with such individual considered to be an eligible individual described in subsection (c)(3)(B) of such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Age of dependents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No payments may be made under paragraph (1) once the youngest of the dependents involved reaches the age of 18.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Benefits secondary to other coverage</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any payment under paragraph (1) shall be secondary to the obligation of the United States or any third party (including any State or local governmental entity, private insurance carrier, or employer), under any other law or contractual agreement, to pay compensation for loss of employment income or to provide disability benefits, retirement benefits, life insurance benefits on behalf of dependents under the age of 18, or death benefits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">Payments under paragraph (1) shall not be made to with respect to&nbsp;<sup><a href="#239e_1_target" name="239e_1">1</a></sup> an eligible individual to the extent that the total of amounts paid with respect to the individual under such paragraph and under the other obligations referred to in clause (i) is an amount that exceeds the rate of payment that applies under paragraph (2). If under any such other obligation a lump-sum payment is made, such payment shall, for purposes of this subparagraph, be deemed to be received over multiple years rather than received in a single year. The Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, determine how to apportion such payment over multiple years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Benefit in addition to medical benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A benefit under subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be in addition to any amounts received by an eligible individual under section 239c of this title.</p>
