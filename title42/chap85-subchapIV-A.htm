<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the presence of acidic compounds and their precursors in the atmosphere and in deposition from the atmosphere represents a threat to natural resources, ecosystems, materials, visibility, and public health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the principal sources of the acidic compounds and their precursors in the atmosphere are emissions of sulfur and nitrogen oxides from the combustion of fossil fuels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the problem of acid deposition is of national and international significance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) strategies and technologies for the control of precursors to acid deposition exist now that are economically feasible, and improved methods are expected to become increasingly available over the next decade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) current and future generations of Americans will be adversely affected by delaying measures to remedy the problem;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) reduction of total atmospheric loading of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides will enhance protection of the public health and welfare and the environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) control measures to reduce precursor emissions from steam-electric generating units should be initiated without delay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to reduce the adverse effects of acid deposition through reductions in annual emissions of sulfur dioxide of ten million tons from 1980 emission levels, and, in combination with other provisions of this chapter, of nitrogen oxides emissions of approximately two million tons from 1980 emission levels, in the forty-eight contiguous States and the District of Columbia. It is the intent of this subchapter to effectuate such reductions by requiring compliance by affected sources with prescribed emission limitations by specified deadlines, which limitations may be met through alternative methods of compliance provided by an emission allocation and transfer system. It is also the purpose of this subchapter to encourage energy conservation, use of renewable and clean alternative technologies, and pollution prevention as a long-range strategy, consistent with the provisions of this subchapter, for reducing air pollution and other adverse impacts of energy production and use.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Acid Deposition Standards</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 404 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;549 directed Administrator of Environmental Protection Agency, not later than 36 months after Nov. 15, 1990, to transmit to Congress a report on the feasibility and effectiveness of an acid deposition standard or standards to protect sensitive and critically sensitive aquatic and terrestrial resources.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Industrial SO<sub>2</sub> Emissions</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 406 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;549 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than January 1, 1995 and every 5 years thereafter, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall transmit to the Congress a report containing an inventory of national annual sulfur dioxide emissions from industrial sources (as defined in title IV of the Act [42 U.S.C. 7651 et seq.]), including units subject to section 405(g)(6) of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7651d(g)(6)], for all years for which data are available, as well as the likely trend in such emissions over the following twenty-year period. The reports shall also contain estimates of the actual emission reduction in each year resulting from promulgation of the diesel fuel desulfurization regulations under section 214 [42 U.S.C. 7548].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) 5.60 <cap-smallcap>Million Ton Cap</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Whenever the inventory required by this section indicates that sulfur dioxide emissions from industrial sources, including units subject to section 405(g)(5) of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7651d(g)(5)], may reasonably be expected to reach levels greater than 5.60 million tons per year, the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency shall take such actions under the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] as may be appropriate to ensure that such emissions do not exceed 5.60 million tons per year. Such actions may include the promulgation of new and revised standards of performance for new sources, including units subject to section 405(g)(5) of the Clean Air Act, under section 111(b) of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7411(b)], as well as promulgation of standards of performance for existing sources, including units subject to section 405(g)(5) of the Clean Air Act, under authority of this section. For an existing source regulated under this section, &lsquo;standard of performance&rsquo; means a standard which the Administrator determines is applicable to that source and which reflects the degree of emission reduction achievable through the application of the best system of continuous emission reduction <!-- PDFPage:6449 -->which (taking into consideration the cost of achieving such emission reduction, and any nonair quality health and environmental impact and energy requirements) the Administrator determines has been adequately demonstrated for that category of sources.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Election</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Regulations promulgated under section 405(b) of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7651d(b)] shall not prohibit a source from electing to become an affected unit under section 410 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7651i].&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">[For termination, effective May 15, 2000, of reporting provisions in section 406(a) of Pub. L. 101&ndash;549, set out above, see section 3003 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;66, as amended, set out as a note under section 1113 of Title 31, Money and Finance, and the 10th item on page 162 of House Document No. 103&ndash;7.]</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sense of Congress on Emission Reductions Costs</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 407 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;549 provided that: &ldquo;It is the sense of the Congress that the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 [Pub. L. 101&ndash;549, see Tables for classification], through the allowance program, allocates the costs of achieving the required reductions in emissions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen among sources in the United States. Broad based taxes and emissions fees that would provide for payment of the costs of achieving required emissions reductions by any party or parties other than the sources required to achieve the reductions are undesirable.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Monitoring of Acid Rain Program in Canada</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 408 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;549 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Reports to Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, in consultation with the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Energy, and other persons the Administrator deems appropriate, shall prepare and submit a report to Congress on January 1, 1994, January 1, 1999, and January 1, 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Contents</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The report to Congress shall analyze the current emission levels of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in each of the provinces participating in Canada's acid rain control program, the amount of emission reductions of sulfur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen achieved by each province, the methods utilized by each province in making those reductions, the costs to each province and the employment impacts in each province of making and maintaining those reductions.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Beginning on January 1, 1999, the reports shall also assess the degree to which each province is complying with its stated emissions cap.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7651b. Sulfur dioxide allowance program for existing and new units</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allocations of annual allowances for existing and new units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651b_1_target" name="7651b_1">1</a></sup> For the emission limitation programs under this subchapter, the Administrator shall allocate annual allowances for the unit, to be held or distributed by the designated representative of the owner or operator of each affected unit at an affected source in accordance with this subchapter, in an amount equal to the annual tonnage emission limitation calculated under section 7651c, 7651d, 7651e, 7651h, or 7651i of this title except as otherwise specifically provided elsewhere in this subchapter. Except as provided in sections 7651d(a)(2), 7651d(a)(3), 7651h and 7651i of this title, beginning January 1, 2000, the Administrator shall not allocate annual allowances to emit sulfur dioxide pursuant to section 7651d of this title in such an amount as would result in total annual emissions of sulfur dioxide from utility units in excess of 8.90 million tons except that the Administrator shall not take into account unused allowances carried forward by owners and operators of affected units or by other persons holding such allowances, following the year for which they were allocated. If necessary to meeting the restrictions imposed in the preceding sentence, the Administrator shall reduce, pro rata, the basic Phase II allowance allocations for each unit subject to the requirements of section 7651d of this title. Subject to the provisions of section 7651<em>o</em> of this title, the Administrator shall allocate allowances for each affected unit at an affected source annually, as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651b_1_target" name="7651b_1">1</a></sup> and section 7651g of this title. Except as provided in sections 7651h and 7651i of this title, the removal of an existing affected unit or source from commercial operation at any time after November 15, 1990 (whether before or after January 1, 1995, or January 1, 2000) shall not terminate or otherwise affect the allocation of allowances pursuant to section 7651c or 7651d of this title to which the unit is entitled. Allowances shall be allocated by the Administrator without cost to the recipient, except for allowances sold by the Administrator pursuant to section 7651<em>o</em> of this title. Not later than December 31, 1991, the Administrator shall publish a proposed list of the basic Phase II allowance allocations, the Phase II bonus allowance allocations and, if applicable, allocations pursuant to section 7651d(a)(3) of this title for each unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of section 7651d of this title for the year 2000 and the <!-- PDFPage:6452 -->year 2010. After notice and opportunity for public comment, but not later than December 31, 1992, the Administrator shall publish a final list of such allocations, subject to the provisions of section 7651d(a)(2) of this title. Any owner or operator of an existing unit subject to the requirements of section 7651d(b) or (c) of this title who is considering applying for an extension of the emission limitation requirement compliance deadline for that unit from January 1, 2000, until not later than December 31, 2000, pursuant to section 7651h of this title, shall notify the Administrator no later than March 31, 1991. Such notification shall be used as the basis for estimating the basic Phase II allowances under this subsection. Prior to June 1, 1998, the Administrator shall publish a revised final statement of allowance allocations, subject to the provisions of section 7651d(a)(2) of this title and taking into account the effect of any compliance date extensions granted pursuant to section 7651h of this title on such allocations. Any person who may make an election concerning the amount of allowances to be allocated to a unit or units shall make such election and so inform the Administrator not later than March 31, 1991, in the case of an election under section 7651d of this title (or June 30, 1991, in the case of an election under section 7651e of this title). If such person fails to make such election, the Administrator shall set forth for each unit owned or operated by such person, the amount of allowances reflecting the election that would, in the judgment of the Administrator, provide the greatest benefit for the owner or operator of the unit. If such person is a Governor who may make an election under section 7651e of this title and the Governor fails to make an election, the Administrator shall set forth for each unit in the State the amount of allowances reflecting the election that would, in the judgment of the Administrator, provide the greatest benefit for units in the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Allowance transfer system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Allowances allocated under this subchapter may be transferred among designated representatives of the owners or operators of affected sources under this subchapter and any other person who holds such allowances, as provided by the allowance system regulations to be promulgated by the Administrator not later than eighteen months after November 15, 1990. Such regulations shall establish the allowance system prescribed under this section, including, but not limited to, requirements for the allocation, transfer, and use of allowances under this subchapter. Such regulations shall prohibit the use of any allowance prior to the calendar year for which the allowance was allocated, and shall provide, consistent with the purposes of this subchapter, for the identification of unused allowances, and for such unused allowances to be carried forward and added to allowances allocated in subsequent years, including allowances allocated to units subject to Phase I requirements (as described in section 7651c of this title) which are applied to emissions limitations requirements in Phase II (as described in section 7651d of this title). Transfers of allowances shall not be effective until written certification of the transfer, signed by a responsible official of each party to the transfer, is received and recorded by the Administrator. Such regulations shall permit the transfer of allowances prior to the issuance of such allowances. Recorded pre-allocation transfers shall be deducted by the Administrator from the number of allowances which would otherwise be allocated to the transferor, and added to those allowances allocated to the transferee. Pre-allocation transfers shall not affect the prohibition contained in this subsection against the use of allowances prior to the year for which they are allocated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interpollutant trading</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than January 1, 1994, the Administrator shall furnish to the Congress a study evaluating the environmental and economic consequences of amending this subchapter to permit trading sulfur dioxide allowances for nitrogen oxides allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allowance tracking system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall promulgate, not later than 18 months after November 15, 1990, a system for issuing, recording, and tracking allowances, which shall specify all necessary procedures and requirements for an orderly and competitive functioning of the allowance system. All allowance allocations and transfers shall, upon recordation by the Administrator, be deemed a part of each unit's permit requirements pursuant to section 7651g of this title, without any further permit review and revision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to insure electric reliability, such regulations shall not prohibit or affect temporary increases and decreases in emissions within utility systems, power pools, or utilities entering into allowance pool agreements, that result from their operations, including emergencies and central dispatch, and such temporary emissions increases and decreases shall not require transfer of allowances among units nor shall it require recordation. The owners or operators of such units shall act through a designated representative. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the total tonnage of emissions in any calendar year (calculated at the end thereof) from all units in such a utility system, power pool, or allowance pool agreements shall not exceed the total allowances for such units for the calendar year concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) New utility units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After January 1, 2000, it shall be unlawful for a new utility unit to emit an annual tonnage of sulfur dioxide in excess of the number of allowances to emit held for the unit by the unit's owner or operator. Such new utility units shall not be eligible for an allocation of sulfur dioxide allowances under subsection (a)(1) of this section, unless the unit is subject to the provisions of subsection (g)(2) or (3) of section 7651d of this title. New utility units may obtain allowances from any person, in accordance with this subchapter. The owner or operator of any new utility unit in violation of this subsection shall be liable for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 7651j of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Nature of allowances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An allowance allocated under this subchapter is a limited authorization to emit sulfur dioxide <!-- PDFPage:6453 -->in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. Such allowance does not constitute a property right. Nothing in this subchapter or in any other provision of law shall be construed to limit the authority of the United States to terminate or limit such authorization. Nothing in this section relating to allowances shall be construed as affecting the application of, or compliance with, any other provision of this chapter to an affected unit or source, including the provisions related to applicable National Ambient Air Quality Standards and State implementation plans. Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring a change of any kind in any State law regulating electric utility rates and charges or affecting any State law regarding such State regulation or as limiting State regulation (including any prudency review) under such a State law. Nothing in this section shall be construed as modifying the Federal Power Act [16 U.S.C. 791a et seq.] or as affecting the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under that Act. Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to interfere with or impair any program for competitive bidding for power supply in a State in which such program is established. Allowances, once allocated to a person by the Administrator, may be received, held, and temporarily or permanently transferred in accordance with this subchapter and the regulations of the Administrator without regard to whether or not a permit is in effect under subchapter V of this chapter or section 7651g of this title with respect to the unit for which such allowance was originally allocated and recorded. Each permit under this subchapter and each permit issued under subchapter V of this chapter for any affected unit shall provide that the affected unit may not emit an annual tonnage of sulfur dioxide in excess of the allowances held for that unit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for any person to hold, use, or transfer any allowance allocated under this subchapter, except in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator. It shall be unlawful for any affected unit to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the number of allowances held for that unit for that year by the owner or operator of the unit. Upon the allocation of allowances under this subchapter, the prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall supersede any other emission limitation applicable under this subchapter to the units for which such allowances are allocated. Allowances may not be used prior to the calendar year for which they are allocated. Nothing in this section or in the allowance system regulations shall relieve the Administrator of the Administrator's permitting, monitoring and enforcement obligations under this chapter, nor relieve affected sources of their requirements and liabilities under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Competitive bidding for power supply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to interfere with or impair any program for competitive bidding for power supply in a State in which such program is established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Applicability of antitrust laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section affects&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the applicability of the antitrust laws to the transfer, use, or sale of allowances, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission under any provision of law respecting unfair methods of competition or anticompetitive acts or practices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this section, &ldquo;antitrust laws&rdquo; means those Acts set forth in section 12 of title 15.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Public Utility Holding Company Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The acquisition or disposition of allowances pursuant to this subchapter including the issuance of securities or the undertaking of any other financing transaction in connection with such allowances shall not be subject to the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.<sup><a href="#7651b_2_target" name="7651b_2">2</a></sup></p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7651c. Phase I sulfur dioxide requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Emission limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After January 1, 1995, each source that includes one or more affected units listed in table A is an affected source under this section. After January 1, 1995, it shall be unlawful for any af<!-- PDFPage:6454 -->fected unit (other than an eligible phase I unit under subsection (d)(2) of this section) to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the tonnage limitation stated as a total number of allowances in table A for phase I, unless (A) the emissions reduction requirements applicable to such unit have been achieved pursuant to subsection (b) or (d) of this section, or (B) the owner or operator of such unit holds allowances to emit not less than the unit's total annual emissions, except that, after January 1, 2000, the emissions limitations established in this section shall be superseded by those established in section 7651d of this title. The owner or operator of any unit in violation of this section shall be fully liable for such violation including, but not limited to, liability for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 7651j of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than December 31, 1991, the Administrator shall determine the total tonnage of reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide from all utility units in calendar year 1995 that will occur as a result of compliance with the emissions limitation requirements of this section, and shall establish a reserve of allowances equal in amount to the number of tons determined thereby not to exceed a total of 3.50 million tons. In making such a determination, the Administrator shall compute for each unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of this section the difference between:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the product of its baseline multiplied by the lesser of each unit's allowable 1985 emissions rate and its actual 1985 emissions rate, divided by 2,000, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the product of each unit's baseline multiplied by 2.50 lbs/mmBtu divided by 2,000,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and sum the computations. The Administrator shall adjust the foregoing calculation to reflect projected calendar year 1995 utilization of the units subject to the emissions limitations of this subchapter that the Administrator finds would have occurred in the absence of the imposition of such requirements. Pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, the Administrator shall allocate allowances from the reserve established hereinunder until the earlier of such time as all such allowances in the reserve are allocated or December 31, 1999.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In addition to allowances allocated pursuant to paragraph (1), in each calendar year beginning in 1995 and ending in 1999, inclusive, the Administrator shall allocate for each unit on Table A that is located in the States of Illinois, Indiana, or Ohio (other than units at Kyger Creek, Clifty Creek and Joppa Steam), allowances in an amount equal to 200,000 multiplied by the unit's pro rata share of the total number of allowances allocated for all units on Table A in the 3 States (other than units at Kyger Creek, Clifty Creek, and Joppa Steam) pursuant to paragraph (1). Such allowances shall be excluded from the calculation of the reserve under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Substitutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner or operator of an affected unit under subsection (a) of this section may include in its section 7651g of this title permit application and proposed compliance plan a proposal to reassign, in whole or in part, the affected unit's sulfur dioxide reduction requirements to any other unit(s) under the control of such owner or operator. Such proposal shall specify&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the designation of the substitute unit or units to which any part of the reduction obligations of subsection (a) of this section shall be required, in addition to, or in lieu of, any original affected units designated under such subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the original affected unit's baseline, the actual and allowable 1985 emissions rate for sulfur dioxide, and the authorized annual allowance allocation stated in table A;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) calculation of the annual average tonnage for calendar years 1985, 1986, and 1987, emitted by the substitute unit or units, based on the baseline for each unit, as defined in section 7651a(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651c_1_target" name="7651c_1">1</a></sup> of this title, multiplied by the lesser of the unit's actual or allowable 1985 emissions rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the emissions rates and tonnage limitations that would be applicable to the original and substitute affected units under the substitution proposal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) documentation, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that the reassigned tonnage limits will, in total, achieve the same or greater emissions reduction than would have been achieved by the original affected unit and the substitute unit or units without such substitution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such other information as the Administrator may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrator's action on substitution proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall take final action on such substitution proposal in accordance with section 7651g(c) of this title if the substitution proposal fulfills the requirements of this subsection. The Administrator may approve a substitution proposal in whole or in part and with such modifications or conditions as may be consistent with the orderly functioning of the allowance system and which will ensure the emissions reductions contemplated by this subchapter. If a proposal does not meet the requirements of subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall disapprove it. The owner or operator of a unit listed in table A shall not substitute another unit or units without the prior approval of the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon approval of a substitution proposal, each substitute unit, and each source with such unit, shall be deemed affected under this subchapter, and the Administrator shall issue a permit to the original and substitute affected source and unit in accordance with the approved substitution plan and section 7651g of this title. The Administrator shall allocate allowances for the original and substitute affected units in accordance with the approved substitution proposal pursuant to section 7651b of this title. It shall be unlawful for any source or unit that is allocated allowances pursuant to this section to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the emissions limitation provided for in the approved substitution permit and plan unless the owner or operator of each unit governed by the permit and ap<!-- PDFPage:6455 -->proved substitution plan holds allowances to emit not less than the units&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651c_2_target" name="7651c_2">2</a></sup> total annual emissions. The owner or operator of any original or substitute affected unit operated in violation of this subsection shall be fully liable for such violation, including liability for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 7651j of this title. If a substitution proposal is disapproved, the Administrator shall allocate allowances to the original affected unit or units in accordance with subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligible phase I extension units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The owner or operator of any affected unit subject to an emissions limitation requirement under this section may petition the Administrator in its permit application under section 7651g of this title for an extension of 2 years of the deadline for meeting such requirement, provided that the owner or operator of any such unit holds allowances to emit not less than the unit's total annual emissions for each of the 2 years of the period of extension. To qualify for such an extension, the affected unit must either employ a qualifying phase I technology, or transfer its phase I emissions reduction obligation to a unit employing a qualifying phase I technology. Such transfer shall be accomplished in accordance with a compliance plan, submitted and approved under section 7651g of this title, that shall govern operations at all units included in the transfer, and that specifies the emissions reduction requirements imposed pursuant to this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such extension proposal shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specify the unit or units proposed for designation as an eligible phase I extension unit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide a copy of an executed contract, which may be contingent upon the Administrator approving the proposal, for the design engineering, and construction of the qualifying phase I technology for the extension unit, or for the unit or units to which the extension unit's emission reduction obligation is to be transferred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) specify the unit's or units&rsquo; baseline, actual 1985 emissions rate, allowable 1985 emissions rate, and projected utilization for calendar years 1995 through 1999;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) require CEMS on both the eligible phase I extension unit or units and the transfer unit or units beginning no later than January 1, 1995; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) specify the emission limitation and number of allowances expected to be necessary for annual operation after the qualifying phase I technology has been installed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall review and take final action on each extension proposal in order of receipt, consistent with section 7651g of this title, and for an approved proposal shall designate the unit or units as an eligible phase I extension unit. The Administrator may approve an extension proposal in whole or in part, and with such modifications or conditions as may be necessary, consistent with the orderly functioning of the allowance system, and to ensure the emissions reductions contemplated by the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651c_3_target" name="7651c_3">3</a></sup> subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In order to determine the number of proposals eligible for allocations from the reserve under subsection (a)(2) of this section and the number of allowances remaining available after each proposal is acted upon, the Administrator shall reduce the total number of allowances remaining available in the reserve by the number of allowances calculated according to subparagraphs (A), (B) and (C) until either no allowances remain available in the reserve for further allocation or all approved proposals have been acted upon. If no allowances remain available in the reserve for further allocation before all proposals have been acted upon by the Administrator, any pending proposals shall be disapproved. The Administrator shall calculate allowances equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the difference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or the projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1995 of each eligible phase I extension unit, as designated under paragraph (3), and the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the difference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or the projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 of each eligible phase I extension unit, as designated under paragraph (3), and the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the amount by which (i) the product of each unit's baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000, exceeds (ii) the tonnage level specified under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection multiplied by a factor of 3.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each eligible Phase I extension unit shall receive allowances determined under subsection (a)(1) or (c) of this section. In addition, for calendar year 1995, the Administrator shall allocate to each eligible Phase I extension unit, from the allowance reserve created pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, allowances equal to the difference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1995 and the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000. In calendar year 1996, the Administrator shall allocate for each eligible unit, from the allowance reserve created pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, allowances equal to the difference between the lesser of the average annual emissions in calendar years 1988 and 1989 or its projected emissions tonnage for calendar year 1996 and the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by an emission rate of 2.50 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000. It shall be unlawful for any source or unit subject to an approved extension plan under this subsection to emit sulfur dioxide in excess of the emissions limitations provided for in the permit and approved extension plan, unless the owner or oper<!-- PDFPage:6456 -->ator of each unit governed by the permit and approved plan holds allowances to emit not less than the unit's total annual emissions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In addition to allowances specified in paragraph (5), the Administrator shall allocate for each eligible Phase I extension unit employing qualifying Phase I technology, for calendar years 1997, 1998, and 1999, additional allowances, from any remaining allowances in the reserve created pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section, following the reduction in the reserve provided for in paragraph (4), not to exceed the amount by which (A) the product of each eligible unit's baseline times an emission rate of 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000, exceeds (B) the tonnage level specified under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) After January 1, 1997, in addition to any liability under this chapter, including under section 7651j of this title, if any eligible phase I extension unit employing qualifying phase I technology or any transfer unit under this subsection emits sulfur dioxide in excess of the annual tonnage limitation specified in the extension plan, as approved in paragraph (3) of this subsection, the Administrator shall, in the calendar year following such excess, deduct allowances equal to the amount of such excess from such unit's annual allowance allocation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allocation of allowances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of a unit that receives authorization from the Governor of the State in which such unit is located to make reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide prior to calendar year 1995 and that is part of a utility system that meets the following requirements: (A) the total coal-fired generation within the utility system as a percentage of total system generation decreased by more than 20 percent between January 1, 1980, and December 31, 1985; and (B) the weighted capacity factor of all coal-fired units within the utility system averaged over the period from January 1, 1985, through December 31, 1987, was below 50 percent, the Administrator shall allocate allowances under this paragraph for the unit pursuant to this subsection. The Administrator shall allocate allowances for a unit that is an affected unit pursuant to section 7651d of this title (but is not also an affected unit under this section) and part of a utility system that includes 1 or more affected units under section 7651d of this title for reductions in the emissions of sulfur dioxide made during the period 1995&ndash;1999 if the unit meets the requirements of this subsection and the requirements of the preceding sentence, except that for the purposes of applying this subsection to any such unit, the prior year concerned as specified below, shall be any year after January 1, 1995 but prior to January 1, 2000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an affected unit under this section described in subparagraph (A),<sup><a href="#7651c_4_target" name="7651c_4">4</a></sup> the allowances allocated under this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may not exceed the amount which (A) the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by the unit's 1985 actual sulfur dioxide emission rate (in lbs. per mmBtu), divided by 2,000, exceeds (B) the allowances specified for such unit in Table A. In the case of an affected unit under section 7651d of this title described in subparagraph (A),<sup><a href="#7651c_4_target" name="7651c_4">4</a></sup> the allowances awarded under this subsection for early reductions in any prior year may not exceed the amount by which (i) the product of the quantity of fossil fuel consumed by the unit (in mmBtu) in the prior year multiplied by the lesser of 2.50 or the most stringent emission rate (in lbs. per mmBtu) applicable to the unit under the applicable implementation plan, divided by 2,000, exceeds (ii) the unit's actual tonnage of sulfur dioxide emission for the prior year concerned. Allowances allocated under this subsection for units referred to in subparagraph (A)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651c_4_target" name="7651c_4">4</a></sup> may be allocated only for emission reductions achieved as a result of physical changes or changes in the method of operation made after November 15, 1990, including changes in the type or quality of fossil fuel consumed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In no event shall the provisions of this paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651c_5_target" name="7651c_5">5</a></sup> be interpreted as an event of force majeur&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651c_6_target" name="7651c_6">6</a></sup> or a commercial impractibility&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651c_7_target" name="7651c_7">7</a></sup> or in any other way as a basis for excused nonperformance by a utility system under a coal sales contract in effect before November 15, 1990.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this subsection:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Qualified energy conservation measure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified energy conservation measure&rdquo; means a cost effective measure, as identified by the Administrator in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, that increases the efficiency of the use of electricity provided by an electric utility to its customers.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified renewable energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;qualified renewable energy&rdquo; means energy derived from biomass, solar, geothermal, or wind as identified by the Administrator in consultation with the Secretary of Energy.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Electric utility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;electric utility&rdquo; means any person, State agency, or Federal agency, which sells electric energy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allowances for emissions avoided through energy conservation and renewable energy</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The regulations under paragraph (4) of this subsection shall provide that for each ton of sulfur dioxide emissions avoided by an electric utility, during the applicable period, through the use of qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewable energy, the Administrator shall allocate a single allowance to such electric utility, on a first-come-first-served basis from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve established under subsection (g) of this section, up to a total of 300,000 allowances for allocation from such Reserve.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Requirements for issuance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall allocate allowances to an electric utility under this subsection only if all of the following requirements are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Such electric utility is paying for the qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewable energy directly or through purchase from another person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The emissions of sulfur dioxide avoided through the use of qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewable energy are quantified in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Administrator under this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6459 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii)(I) Such electric utility has adopted and is implementing a least cost energy conservation and electric power plan which evaluates a range of resources, including new power supplies, energy conservation, and renewable energy resources, in order to meet expected future demand at the lowest system cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) The qualified energy conservation measures or qualified renewable energy, or both, are consistent with that plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Electric utilities subject to the jurisdiction of a State regulatory authority must have such plan approved by such authority. For electric utilities not subject to the jurisdiction of a State regulatory authority such plan shall be approved by the entity with rate-making authority for such utility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) In the case of qualified energy conservation measures undertaken by a State regulated electric utility, the Secretary of Energy certifies that the State regulatory authority with jurisdiction over the electric rates of such electric utility has established rates and charges which ensure that the net income of such electric utility after implementation of specific cost effective energy conservation measures is at least as high as such net income would have been if the energy conservation measures had not been implemented. Upon the date of any such certification by the Secretary of Energy, all allowances which, but for this paragraph, would have been allocated under subparagraph (A) before such date, shall be allocated to the electric utility. This clause is not a requirement for qualified renewable energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Such utility or any subsidiary of the utility's holding company owns or operates at least one affected unit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Period of applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Allowances under this subsection shall be allocated only with respect to kilowatt hours of electric energy saved by qualified energy conservation measures or generated by qualified renewable energy after January 1, 1992 and before the earlier of (i) December 31, 2000, or (ii) the date on which any electric utility steam generating unit owned or operated by the electric utility to which the allowances are allocated becomes subject to this subchapter (including those sources that elect to become affected by this subchapter, pursuant to section 7651i of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Determination of avoided emissions</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In order to receive allowances under this subsection, an electric utility shall make an application which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) designates the qualified energy conservation measures implemented and the qualified renewable energy sources used for purposes of avoiding emissions,<sup><a href="#7651c_8_target" name="7651c_8">8</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) calculates, in accordance with subparagraphs (F) and (G), the number of tons of emissions avoided by reason of the implementation of such measures or the use of such renewable energy sources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) demonstrates that the requirements of subparagraph (B) have been met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Such application for allowances by a State-regulated electric utility shall require approval by the State regulatory authority with jurisdiction over such electric utility. The authority shall review the application for accuracy and compliance with this subsection and the rules under this subsection. Electric utilities whose retail rates are not subject to the jurisdiction of a State regulatory authority shall apply directly to the Administrator for such approval.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Avoided emissions from qualified energy conservation measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purposes of this subsection, the emission tonnage deemed avoided by reason of the implementation of qualified energy conservation measures for any calendar year shall be a tonnage equal to the product of multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the kilowatt hours that would otherwise have been supplied by the utility during such year in the absence of such qualified energy conservation measures, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 0.004,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and dividing by 2,000.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Avoided emissions from the use of qualified renewable energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The emissions tonnage deemed avoided by reason of the use of qualified renewable energy by an electric utility for any calendar year shall be a tonnage equal to the product of multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the actual kilowatt hours generated by, or purchased from, qualified renewable energy, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 0.004,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and dividing by 2,000.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) No allowances shall be allocated under this subsection for the implementation of programs that are exclusively informational or educational in nature.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) No allowances shall be allocated for energy conservation measures or renewable energy that were operational before January 1, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Savings provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection precludes a State or State regulatory authority from providing additional incentives to utilities to encourage investment in demand-side resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 18 months after November 15, 1990, and in conjunction with the regulations required to be promulgated under subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Administrator shall, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, promulgate regulations under this <!-- PDFPage:6460 -->subsection. Such regulations shall list energy conservation measures and renewable energy sources which may be treated as qualified energy conservation measures and qualified renewable energy for purposes of this subsection. Allowances shall only be allocated if all requirements of this subsection and the rules promulgated to implement this subsection are complied with. The Administrator shall review the determinations of each State regulatory authority under this subsection to encourage consistency from electric utility to electric utility and from State to State in accordance with the Administrator's rules. The Administrator shall publish the findings of this review no less than annually.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall establish a Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve under this subsection. Beginning on January 1, 1995, the Administrator may allocate from the Conservation and Renewable Energy Reserve an amount equal to a total of 300,000 allowances for emissions of sulfur dioxide pursuant to section 7651b of this title. In order to provide 300,000 allowances for such reserve, in each year beginning in calendar year 2000 and until calendar year 2009, inclusive, the Administrator shall reduce each unit's basic Phase II allowance allocation on the basis of its pro rata share of 30,000 allowances. If allowances remain in the reserve after January 2, 2010, the Administrator shall allocate such allowances for affected units under section 7651d of this title on a pro rata basis. For purposes of this subsection, for any unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of section 7651d of this title, the term &ldquo;pro rata basis&rdquo; refers to the ratio which the reductions made in such unit's allowances in order to establish the reserve under this subsection bears to the total of such reductions for all such units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Alternative allowance allocation for units in certain utility systems with optional baseline</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Optional baseline for units in certain systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of this section which (as of November 15, 1990)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has an emission rate below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has decreased its sulfur dioxide emissions rate by 60 percent or greater since 1980, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is part of a utility system which has a weighted average sulfur dioxide emissions rate for all fossil fueled-fired units below 1.0 lbs/mmBtu,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">at the election of the owner or operator of such unit, the unit's baseline may be calculated (i) as provided under section 7651a(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651c_9_target" name="7651c_9">9</a></sup> of this title, or (ii) by utilizing the unit's average annual fuel consumption at a 60 percent capacity factor. Such election shall be made no later than March 1, 1991.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allowance allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever a unit referred to in paragraph (1) elects to calculate its baseline as provided in clause (ii) of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall allocate allowances for the unit pursuant to section 7651b(a)(1) of this title, this section, and section 7651d of this title (as basic Phase II allowance allocations) in an amount equal to the baseline selected multiplied by the lower of the average annual emission rate for such unit in 1989, or 1.0 lbs./mmBtu. Such allowance allocation shall be in lieu of any allocation of allowances under this section and section 7651d of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After January 1, 2000, each existing utility unit as provided below is subject to the limitations or requirements of this section. Each utility unit subject to an annual sulfur dioxide tonnage emission limitation under this section is an affected unit under this subchapter. Each source that includes one or more affected units is an affected source. In the case of an existing unit that was not in operation during calendar year 1985, the emission rate for a calendar year after 1985, as determined by the Administrator, shall be used in lieu of the 1985 rate. The owner or operator of any unit operated in violation of this section shall be fully liable under this chapter for fulfilling the obligations specified in section 7651j of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to basic Phase II allowance allocations, in each year beginning in calendar year 2000 and ending in calendar year 2009, inclusive, the Administrator shall allocate up to 530,000 Phase II bonus allowances pursuant to subsections (b)(2), (c)(4), (d)(3)(A) and (B), and (h)(2) of this section and section 7651e of this title.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the date that a coal-fired utility unit becomes an affected unit pursuant to sections 7651c, 7651d,<sup><a href="#7651f_1_target" name="7651f_1">1</a></sup> 7651h of this title, or on the date a unit subject to the provisions of section 7651c(d) or 7651h(b) of this title, must meet the SO<sub>2</sub> reduction requirements, each such unit shall become an affected unit for purposes of this section and shall be subject to the emission limitations for nitrogen oxides set forth herein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Emission limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than eighteen months after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall by regulation establish annual allowable emission limitations for nitrogen oxides for the types of utility boilers listed below, which limitations shall not exceed the rates listed below: <em>Provided</em>, That the Administrator may set a rate higher than that listed for any type of utility boiler if the Administrator finds that the maximum listed rate for that boiler type cannot be achieved using low NO<sub>x</sub> burner technology. The maximum allowable emission rates are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for tangentially fired boilers, 0.45 lb/mmBtu;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for dry bottom wall-fired boilers (other than units applying cell burner technology), 0.50 lb/mmBtu.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">After January 1, 1995, it shall be unlawful for any unit that is an affected unit on that date and is of the type listed in this paragraph to emit nitrogen oxides in excess of the emission rates set by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than January 1, 1997, the Administrator shall, by regulation, establish allowable emission limitations on a lb/mmBtu, annual average basis, for nitrogen oxides for the following types of utility boilers:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) wet bottom wall-fired boilers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) cyclones;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) units applying cell burner technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) all other types of utility boilers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Administrator shall base such rates on the degree of reduction achievable through the retrofit application of the best system of continuous emission reduction, taking into account available technology, costs and energy and environmental impacts; and which is comparable to the costs of nitrogen oxides controls set pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section. Not later than January 1, 1997, the Administrator may revise the applicable emission limitations for tangentially fired and dry bottom, wall-fired boilers (other than cell burners) to be more stringent if the Administrator determines that more effective low NO<sub>x</sub> burner technology is available: <em>Provided</em>, That, no unit that is an affected unit pur<!-- PDFPage:6466 -->suant to section 7651c of this title and that is subject to the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section, shall be subject to the revised emission limitations, if any.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Revised performance standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651f_2_target" name="7651f_2">2</a></sup> Not later than January 1, 1993, the Administrator shall propose revised standards of performance to section 7411 of this title for nitrogen oxides emissions from fossil-fuel fired steam generating units, including both electric utility and nonutility units. Not later than January 1, 1994, the Administrator shall promulgate such revised standards of performance. Such revised standards of performance shall reflect improvements in methods for the reduction of emissions of oxides of nitrogen.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Alternative emission limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The permitting authority shall, upon request of an owner or operator of a unit subject to this section, authorize an emission limitation less stringent than the applicable limitation established under subsection (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section upon a determination that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a unit subject to subsection (b)(1) of this section cannot meet the applicable limitation using low NO<sub>x</sub> burner technology; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a unit subject to subsection (b)(2) of this section cannot meet the applicable rate using the technology on which the Administrator based the applicable emission limitation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The permitting authority shall base such determination upon a showing satisfactory to the permitting authority, in accordance with regulations established by the Administrator not later than eighteen months after November 15, 1990, that the owner or operator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has properly installed appropriate control equipment designed to meet the applicable emission rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has properly operated such equipment for a period of fifteen months (or such other period of time as the Administrator determines through the regulations), and provides operating and monitoring data for such period demonstrating that the unit cannot meet the applicable emission rate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) has specified an emission rate that such unit can meet on an annual average basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The permitting authority shall issue an operating permit for the unit in question, in accordance with section 7651g of this title and part B&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651f_3_target" name="7651f_3">3</a></sup> of title III&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that permits the unit during the demonstration period referred to in subparagraph (2) above, to emit at a rate in excess of the applicable emission rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) at the conclusion of the demonstration period to revise the operating permit to reflect the alternative emission rate demonstrated in paragraphs (2) and (3) above.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Units subject to subsection (b)(1) of this section for which an alternative emission limitation is established shall not be required to install any additional control technology beyond low NO<sub>x</sub> burners. Nothing in this section shall preclude an owner or operator from installing and operating an alternative NO<sub>x</sub> control technology capable of achieving the applicable emission limitation. If the owner or operator of a unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the technology necessary to meet such requirements is not in adequate supply to enable its installation and operation at the unit, consistent with system reliability, by January 1, 1995, then the Administrator shall extend the deadline for compliance for the unit by a period of 15 months. Any owner or operator may petition the Administrator to make a determination under the previous sentence. The Administrator shall grant or deny such petition within 3 months of submittal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Emissions averaging</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In lieu of complying with the applicable emission limitations under subsection (b)(1), (2), or (d) of this section, the owner or operator of two or more units subject to one or more of the applicable emission limitations set pursuant to these sections,<sup><a href="#7651f_4_target" name="7651f_4">4</a></sup> may petition the permitting authority for alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations for such units that ensure that (1) the actual annual emission rate in pounds of nitrogen oxides per million Btu averaged over the units in question is a rate that is less than or equal to (2) the Btu-weighted average annual emission rate for the same units if they had been operated, during the same period of time, in compliance with limitations set in accordance with the applicable emission rates set pursuant to subsections (b)(1) and (2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If the permitting authority determines, in accordance with regulations issued by the Administrator not later than eighteen months after November 15, 1990;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651f_5_target" name="7651f_5">5</a></sup> that the conditions in the paragraph above can be met, the permitting authority shall issue operating permits for such units, in accordance with section 7651g of this title and part B&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651f_3_target" name="7651f_3">3</a></sup> of title III, that allow alternative contemporaneous annual emission limitations. Such emission limitations shall only remain in effect while both units continue operation under the conditions specified in their respective operating permits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Permits issued to implement this subchapter shall be issued for a period of 5 years, notwithstanding subchapter V of this chapter. No permit shall be issued that is inconsistent with the requirements of this subchapter, and subchapter V of this chapter as applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each initial permit application shall be accompanied by a compliance plan for the source to comply with its requirements under this subchapter. Where an affected source consists of more than one affected unit, such plan shall cover all such units, and for purposes of section 7661a(c) of this title, such source shall be considered a &ldquo;facility&rdquo;. Nothing in this section regarding compliance plans or in subchapter V of this chapter shall be construed as affecting allowances. Except as provided under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section, submission of a statement by the owner or operator, or the designated representative of the owners and operators, of a unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of sections 7651c, 7651d, and 7651f of this title, that the unit will meet the applicable emissions limitation requirements of such sections in a timely manner or that, in the case of the emissions limitation requirements of sections 7651c and 7651d of this title, the owners and operators will hold allowances to emit not less than the total annual emissions of the unit, shall be deemed to meet the proposed and approved compliance planning requirements of this section and subchapter V of this chapter, except that, for any unit that will meet the requirements of this subchapter by means of an alternative method of compliance authorized under section 7651c(b), (c), (d), or (f) of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651g_1_target" name="7651g_1">1</a></sup> section 7651f(d) or (e) of this title, section 7651h of this title and section 7651i of this title, the proposed and approved compliance plan, permit application and permit shall include, pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Administrator, for each alternative method of compliance a comprehensive description of the schedule and means by which the unit will rely on one or more alternative methods of compliance in the manner and time authorized under this subchapter. Recordation by the Administrator of transfers of allowances shall amend automatically all applicable proposed or approved permit applications, compliance plans and permits. The Administrator may also require&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7651h. Repowered sources</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than December 31, 1997, the owner or operator of an existing unit subject to the emissions limitation requirements of section 7651d(b) and (c) of this title may demonstrate to the permitting authority that one or more units will be repowered with a qualifying clean coal technology to comply with the requirements under section 7651d of this title. The owner or operator shall, as part of any such demonstration, provide, not later than January 1, 2000, satisfactory documentation of a preliminary design and engineering effort for such repowering and an executed and binding contract for the majority of the equipment to repower such unit and such other information as the Administrator may require by regulation. The replacement of an existing utility unit with a new utility unit using a repowering technology referred to in section 7651a(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651h_1_target" name="7651h_1">1</a></sup> of this title which is located at a different site, shall be treated as repowering of the existing unit for purposes of this subchapter, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the replacement unit is designated by the owner or operator to replace such existing unit, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the existing unit is retired from service on or before the date on which the designated replacement unit enters commercial operation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An owner or operator satisfying the requirements of subsection (a) of this section shall be granted an extension of the emission limitation requirement compliance date for that unit from January 1, 2000, to December 31, 2003. The extension shall be specified in the permit issued to the source under section 7651g of this title, together with any compliance schedule and other requirements necessary to meet second phase requirements by the extended date. Any unit that is granted an extension under this section shall not be eligible for a waiver under section 7411(j) of this title, and shall continue to be subject to requirements under this subchapter as if it were a unit subject to section 7651d of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If (A) the owner or operator of an existing unit has been granted an extension under paragraph (1) in order to repower such unit with a clean coal unit, and (B) such owner or operator demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the repowering technology to be utilized by such unit has been properly constructed and tested on such unit, but nevertheless has been unable to achieve the emission reduction limitations and is economically or technologically infeasible, such existing unit may be retrofitted or repowered with equipment or facilities utilizing another clean coal technology or other available control technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allowances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the period of the extension under this section, the Administrator shall allocate to the owner or operator of the affected unit, annual allowances for sulfur dioxide equal to the affected unit's baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit's federally approved State Implementation Plan emissions limitation or its actual emission rate for 1995 in lieu of any other allocation. Such allowances may not be transferred or used by any other source to meet emission requirements under this subchapter. The source owner or operator shall notify the Administrator sixty days in advance of the date on which the affected unit for which the extension has been granted is to be removed from operation to install the repowering technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Effective on that date, the unit shall be subject to the requirements of section 7651d of this title. Allowances for the year in which the unit is removed from operation to install the repowering technology shall be calculated as the product of the unit's baseline multiplied by 1.20 <!-- PDFPage:6470 -->lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000, and prorated accordingly, and are transferable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Allowances for such existing utility units for calendar years after the year the repowering is complete shall be calculated as the product of the existing unit's baseline multiplied by 1.20 lbs/mmBtu, divided by 2,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 7651b(a) and (e) of this title, allowances shall be allocated under this section for a designated replacement unit which replaces an existing unit (as provided in the last sentence of subsection (a) of this section) in lieu of any further allocations of allowances for the existing unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purpose of meeting the aggregate emissions limitation requirement set forth in section 7651b(a)(1) of this title, the units with an extension under this subsection shall be treated in each calendar year during the extension period as holding allowances allocated under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Control requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any unit qualifying for an extension under this section that does not increase actual hourly emissions for any pollutant regulated under the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651h_2_target" name="7651h_2">2</a></sup> chapter shall not be subject to any standard of performance under section 7411 of this title. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection, no new unit (1) designated as a replacement for an existing unit, (2) qualifying for the extension under subsection (b) of this section, and (3) located at a different site than the existing unit shall receive an exemption from the requirements imposed under section 7411 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Expedited permitting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">State permitting authorities and, where applicable, the Administrator, are encouraged to give expedited consideration to permit applications under parts C and D of subchapter I of this chapter for any source qualifying for an extension under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of a repowered source to fail to comply with the requirement of this section, or any regulations of permit requirements to implement this section, including the prohibition against emitting sulfur dioxide in excess of allowances held.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7651i. Election for additional sources</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner or operator of any unit that is not, nor will become, an affected unit under section 7651b(e), 7651c, or 7651d of this title, or that is a process source under subsection (d) of this section, that emits sulfur dioxide, may elect to designate that unit or source to become an affected unit and to receive allowances under this subchapter. An election shall be submitted to the Administrator for approval, along with a permit application and proposed compliance plan in accordance with section 7651g of this title. The Administrator shall approve a designation that meets the requirements of this section, and such designated unit, or source, shall be allocated allowances, and be an affected unit for purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of baseline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The baseline for a unit designated under this section shall be established by the Administrator by regulation, based on fuel consumption and operating data for the unit for calendar years 1985, 1986, and 1987, or if such data is not available, the Administrator may prescribe a baseline based on alternative representative data.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Emission limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Annual emissions limitations for sulfur dioxide shall be equal to the product of the baseline multiplied by the lesser of the unit's 1985 actual or allowable emission rate in lbs/mmBtu, or, if the unit did not operate in 1985, by the lesser of the unit's actual or allowable emission rate for a calendar year after 1985 (as determined by the Administrator), divided by 2,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Process sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 18 months after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall establish a program under which the owner or operator of a process source that emits sulfur dioxide may elect to designate that source as an affected unit for the purpose of receiving allowances under this subchapter. The Administrator shall, by regulation, define the sources that may be designated; specify the emissions limitation; specify the operating, emission baseline, and other data requirements; prescribe CEMS or other monitoring requirements; and promulgate permit, reporting, and any other requirements necessary to implement such a program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allowances and permits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall issue allowances to an affected unit under this section in an amount equal to the emissions limitation calculated under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, in accordance with section 7651b of this title. Such allowance may be used in accordance with, and shall be subject to, the provisions of section 7651b of this title. Affected sources under this section shall be subject to the requirements of sections 7651b, 7651g, 7651j, 7651k, 7651<em>l</em>, and 7651m of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any unit designated under this section shall not transfer or bank allowances produced as a result of reduced utilization or shutdown, except that, such allowances may be transferred or carried forward for use in subsequent years to the extent that the reduced utilization or shutdown results from the replacement of thermal energy from the unit designated under this section, with thermal energy generated by any other unit or units subject to the requirements of this subchapter, and the designated unit's allowances are transferred or carried forward for use at such other replacement unit or units. In no case may the Administrator allocate to a source designated under this section allowances in an amount greater than the emissions resulting from operation of the source in full compliance <!-- PDFPage:6471 -->with the requirements of this chapter. No such allowances shall authorize operation of a unit in violation of any other requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall issue regulations to implement this section not later than eighteen months after November 15, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Small diesel refineries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall issue allowances to owners or operators of small diesel refineries who produce diesel fuel after October 1, 1993, meeting the requirements of subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651i_1_target" name="7651i_1">1</a></sup> 7545(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Allowance period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Allowances may be allocated under this subsection only for the period from October 1, 1993, through December 31, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allowance determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The number of allowances allocated pursuant to this paragraph shall equal the annual number of pounds of sulfur dioxide reduction attributable to desulfurization by a small refinery divided by 2,000. For the purposes of this calculation, the concentration of sulfur removed from diesel fuel shall be the difference between 0.274 percent (by weight) and 0.050 percent (by weight).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refinery eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;small refinery&rdquo; shall mean a refinery or portion of a refinery&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which, as of November 15, 1990, has bona fide crude oil throughput of less than 18,250,000 barrels per year, as reported to the Department of Energy, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which, as of November 15, 1990, is owned or controlled by a refiner with a total combined bona fide crude oil throughput of less than 50,187,500 barrels per year, as reported to the Department of Energy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation per refinery</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner and operator of any source subject to this subchapter shall be required to install and operate CEMS on each affected unit at the source, and to quality assure the data for sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, opacity and volumetric flow at each such unit. The Administrator shall, by regulations issued not later than eighteen months after November 15, 1990, specify the requirements for CEMS, for any alternative monitoring system that is demonstrated as providing information with the same precision, reliability, accessibility, and timeliness as that provided by CEMS, and for recordkeeping and reporting of information from such systems. Such regulations may include limitations or the use of alternative compliance methods by units equipped with an alternative monitoring system as may be necessary to preserve the orderly functioning of the allowance system, and which will ensure the emissions reductions contemplated by this subchapter. Where 2 or more units utilize a single stack, a separate CEMS shall not be required for each unit, and for such units the regulations shall require that the owner or operator collect sufficient information to permit reliable compliance determinations for each such unit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) First phase requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than thirty-six months after November 15, 1990, the owner or operator of each affected unit under section 7651c of this title, including, but not limited to, units that become affected units pursuant to subsections (b) and (c) and eligible units under subsection (d), shall install and operate CEMS, quality assure the data, and keep records and reports in accordance with the regulations issued under subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Second phase requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than January 1, 1995, the owner or operator of each affected unit that has not previously met the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) shall install and operate CEMS, quality assure the data, and keep records and reports in accordance with the regulations issued under subsection (a). Upon commencement of commercial operation of each new utility unit, the unit shall comply with the requirements of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unavailability of emissions data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If CEMS data or data from an alternative monitoring system approved by the Administrator under subsection (a) is not available for any affected unit during any period of a calendar year in which such data is required under this subchapter, and the owner or operator cannot provide information, satisfactory to the Administrator, on emissions during that period, the Administrator shall deem the unit to be operating in an uncontrolled manner during the entire period for which the data was not available and shall, by regulation which shall be issued not later than eighteen months after November 15, 1990, prescribe means to calculate emissions for that period. The owner or operator shall be liable for excess emissions fees and offsets under section 7651j of this title in accordance with such regulations. Any fee due and payable under this subsection shall not diminish the liability of the unit's owner or operator for any fine, penalty, fee or assessment against the unit for the same violation under any other section of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be unlawful for the owner or operator of any source subject to this subchapter to operate a source without complying with the requirements of this section, and any regulations implementing this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Installation, operation, cessation, or removal of a temporary clean coal technology demonstration project that is operated for a period of five years or less, and which complies with the State implementation plans for the State in which the project is located and other requirements necessary to attain and maintain the national ambient air quality standards during and after the project is terminated, shall not subject such facility to the requirements of section 7411 of this title or part C or D of subchapter I of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Permanent projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For permanent clean coal technology demonstration projects that constitute repowering as defined in section 7651a(<em>l</em>)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651n_1_target" name="7651n_1">1</a></sup> of this title, any qualifying project shall not be subject to standards of performance under section 7411 of this title or to the review and permitting requirements of part C&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651n_2_target" name="7651n_2">2</a></sup> for any pollutant the potential emissions of which will not increase as a result of the demonstration project.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) EPA regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 12 months after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations or interpretive rulings to revise requirements under section 7411 of this title and parts C and D,<sup><a href="#7651n_2_target" name="7651n_2">2</a></sup> as appropriate, to facilitate projects consistent in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651n_3_target" name="7651n_3">3</a></sup> this subsection. With respect to parts C and D,<sup><a href="#7651n_2_target" name="7651n_2">2</a></sup> such regulations or rulings shall apply to all areas in which EPA is the permitting authority. In those instances in which the State is the permitting authority under part C or D,<sup><a href="#7651n_2_target" name="7651n_2">2</a></sup> any State may adopt and submit to the Administrator for approval revisions to its implementation plan to apply the regulations or rulings promulgated under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exemption for reactivation of very clean units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Physical changes or changes in the method of operation associated with the commencement of commercial operations by a coal-fired utility unit after a period of discontinued operation shall not subject the unit to the requirements of section 7411 of this title or part C of the Act&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651n_2_target" name="7651n_2">2</a></sup> where the unit (1) has not been in operation for the two-year period prior to the enactment of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 [November 15, 1990], and the emissions from such unit continue to be carried in the permitting authority's emissions inventory at the time of enactment, (2) was equipped prior to shut-down with a continuous system of emissions control that achieves a removal efficiency for sulfur dioxide of no less than 85 percent and a removal efficiency for particulates of no less than 98 percent, (3) is equipped with low-NO<sub>x</sub> burners prior to the time of commencement, and (4) is otherwise in compliance with the requirements of this chapter.</p>

No proceeds of any sale under this subsection shall be held by any officer or employee of the United States or treated for any purpose as revenue to the United States or to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Termination of subaccount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Administrator determines that, during any period of 2 consecutive calendar years, less than 20 percent of the allowances available in the subaccount for direct sales established under this subsection have been purchased under this paragraph, the Administrator shall terminate the subaccount and transfer such allowances to the Auction Subaccount under subsection (d) of this section.</p>

The allowances referred to in paragraph (1) shall be offered for sale at auction in the amounts specified in table 2. The auction shall be open to any person. A person wishing to bid for such allowances shall submit (by a date set by the Administrator) to the Administrator (on a sealed bid schedule provided by the Administrator) offers to purchase specified numbers of allowances at specified prices. Such regulations shall specify that the auctioned allowances shall be allocated and sold on the basis of bid price, starting with the highest-priced bid and continuing until all allowances for sale at such auction have been allocated. The regulations shall not permit that a minimum price be set for the purchase of withheld allowances.
