<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assuring access to a choice of coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Choice of at least two plans in each area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall ensure that each part D eligible individual has available, consistent with paragraph (2), a choice of enrollment in at least 2 qualifying plans (as defined in paragraph (3)) in the area in which the individual resides, at least one of which is a prescription drug plan. In any such case in which such plans are not available, the part D eligible individual shall be given the opportunity to enroll in a fallback prescription drug plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirement for different plan sponsors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirement in paragraph (1) is not satisfied with respect to an area if only one entity offers all the qualifying plans in the area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Qualifying plan defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;qualifying plan&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a prescription drug plan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an MA&ndash;PD plan described in section 1395w&ndash;21(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title that provides&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) basic prescription drug coverage; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) qualified prescription drug coverage that provides supplemental prescription drug coverage so long as there is no MA monthly supplemental beneficiary premium applied under the plan, due to the application of a credit against such premium of a rebate under section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(1)(C) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Flexibility in risk assumed and application of fallback plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to ensure access pursuant to subsection (a) of this section in an area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may approve limited risk plans under section 1395w&ndash;111(f) of this title for the area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) only if such access is still not provided in the area after applying paragraph (1), the Secretary shall provide for the offering of a fallback prescription drug plan for that area under section 1395w&ndash;111(g) of this title.</p>
