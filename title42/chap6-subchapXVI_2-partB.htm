<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Time, manner, form, and duration of payments; representative payees; promulgation of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Benefits under this subchapter shall be paid at such time or times and in such installments as will best effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, as determined under regulations (and may in any case be paid less frequently than monthly where the amount of the monthly benefit would not exceed $10).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) Payments of the benefit of any individual may be made to any such individual or to the eligible spouse (if any) of such individual or partly to each.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) Upon a determination by the Commissioner of Social Security that the interest of such individual would be served thereby, such payments shall be made, regardless of the legal competency or incompetency of the individual or eligible spouse, to another individual, or an organization, with respect to whom the requirements of subparagraph (B) have been met (in this paragraph referred to as such individual's &ldquo;representative payee&rdquo;) for the use and benefit of the individual or eligible spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) In the case of an individual eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability, if alcoholism or drug addiction is a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled, the payment of such benefits to a representative payee shall be deemed to serve the interest of the individual under this subchapter. In any case in which such payment is so deemed under this subclause to serve the interest of an individual, the Commissioner of Social Security shall include, in the individual's notification of such eligibility, a notice that alcoholism or drug addiction is a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled and that the Commissioner of Social Security is therefore required to pay the individual's benefits to a representative payee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Commissioner of Social Security or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative payee of an individual or eligible spouse has misused any benefits which have been paid to the representative payee pursuant to clause (ii) or section 405(j)(1) of this title, the Commissioner of Social Security shall promptly terminate payment of benefits to the representative payee pursuant to this subparagraph, and provide for payment of benefits to an alternative representative payee of the individual or eligible spouse or, if the interest of the individual under this subchapter would be served thereby, to the individual or eligible spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Any determination made under subparagraph (A) for payment of benefits to the representative payee of an individual or eligible spouse shall be made on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) an investigation by the Commissioner of Social Security of the person to serve as rep<!-- PDFPage:1515 -->resentative payee, which shall be conducted in advance of such payment, and shall, to the extent practicable, include a face-to-face interview with such person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) adequate evidence that such payment is in the interest of the individual or eligible spouse (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security in regulations).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) As part of the investigation referred to in clause (i)(I), the Commissioner of Social Security shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) require the person being investigated to submit documented proof of the identity of such person, unless information establishing such identity was submitted with an application for benefits under subchapter II of this chapter or this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) verify the social security account number (or employer identification number) of such person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) determine whether such person has been convicted of a violation of section 408 or 1383a of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) determine whether payment of benefits to such person has been terminated pursuant to subparagraph (A)(iii), and whether certification of payment of benefits to such person has been revoked pursuant to section 405(j) of this title, by reason of misuse of funds paid as benefits under subchapter II of this chapter or this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Benefits of an individual may not be paid to any other person pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) such person has previously been convicted as described in clause (ii)(III);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) except as provided in clause (iv), payment of benefits to such person pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) has previously been terminated as described in clause (ii)(IV), or certification of payment of benefits to such person under section 405(j) of this title has previously been revoked as described in section 405(j)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) except as provided in clause (v), such person is a creditor of such individual who provides such individual with goods or services for consideration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe regulations under which the Commissioner of Social Security may grant an exemption from clause (iii)(II) to any person on a case-by-case basis if such exemption would be in the best interest of the individual or eligible spouse whose benefits under this subchapter would be paid to such person pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) Clause (iii)(III) shall not apply with respect to any person who is a creditor referred to therein if such creditor is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a relative of such individual if such relative resides in the same household as such individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) a legal guardian or legal representative of such individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) a facility that is licensed or certified as a care facility under the law of a State or a political subdivision of a State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) a person who is an administrator, owner, or employee of a facility referred to in subclause (III) if such individual resides in such facility, and the payment of benefits under this subchapter to such facility or such person is made only after good faith efforts have been made by the local servicing office of the Social Security Administration to locate an alternative representative payee to whom the payment of such benefits would serve the best interests of such individual; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) an individual who is determined by the Commissioner of Social Security, on the basis of written findings and under procedures which the Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe by regulation, to be acceptable to serve as a representative payee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) The procedures referred to in clause (v)(V) shall require the individual who will serve as representative payee to establish, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) such individual poses no risk to the beneficiary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the financial relationship of such individual to the beneficiary poses no substantial conflict of interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) no other more suitable representative payee can be found.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) In the case of an individual eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability, if alcoholism or drug addiction is a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled, when selecting such individual's representative payee, preference shall be given to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a community-based nonprofit social service agency licensed or bonded by the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) a Federal, State, or local government agency whose mission is to carry out income maintenance, social service, or health care-related activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) a State or local government agency with fiduciary responsibilities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) a designee of an agency (other than of a Federal agency) referred to in the preceding subclauses of this clause, if the Commissioner of Social Security deems it appropriate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless the Commissioner of Social Security determines that selection of a family member would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) Subject to clause (ix), if the Commissioner of Social Security makes a determination described in subparagraph (A)(ii) with respect to any individual's benefit and determines that direct payment of the benefit to the individual would cause substantial harm to the individual, the Commissioner of Social Security may defer (in the case of initial entitlement) or suspend (in the case of existing entitlement) direct payment of such benefit to the individual, until such time as the selection of a representative payee is made pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ix)(I) Except as provided in subclause (II), any deferral or suspension of direct payment of a benefit pursuant to clause (viii) shall be for a period of not more than 1 month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) Subclause (I) shall not apply in any case in which the individual or eligible spouse is, as of the date of the Commissioner's determination, legally incompetent, under the age of 15 years, or (if alcoholism or drug addiction is a contrib<!-- PDFPage:1516 -->uting factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled) is eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(x) Payment pursuant to this subparagraph of any benefits which are deferred or suspended pending the selection of a representative payee shall be made to the individual, or to the representative payee upon such selection, as a single sum or over such period of time as the Commissioner of Social Security determines is in the best interests of the individual entitled to such benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(xi) Any individual who is dissatisfied with a determination by the Commissioner of Social Security to pay such individual's benefits to a representative payee under this subchapter, or with the designation of a particular person to serve as representative payee, shall be entitled to a hearing by the Commissioner of Social Security, and to judicial review of the Commissioner's final decision, to the same extent as is provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(xii) In advance of the first payment of an individual's benefit to a representative payee under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Commissioner of Social Security shall provide written notice of the Commissioner's initial determination to make any such payment. Such notice shall be provided to such individual, except that, if such individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) is under the age of 15,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) is an unemancipated minor under the age of 18, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) is legally incompetent,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such notice shall be provided solely to the legal guardian or legal representative of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(xiii) Any notice described in clause (xii) shall be clearly written in language that is easily understandable to the reader, shall identify the person to be designated as such individual's representative payee, and shall explain to the reader the right under clause (xi) of such individual or of such individual's legal guardian or legal representative&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) to appeal a determination that a representative payee is necessary for such individual,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) to appeal the designation of a particular person to serve as the representative payee of such individual, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) to review the evidence upon which such designation is based and submit additional evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In any case where payment is made under this subchapter to a representative payee of an individual or spouse, the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish a system of accountability monitoring whereby such person shall report not less often than annually with respect to the use of such payments. The Commissioner of Social Security shall establish and implement statistically valid procedures for reviewing such reports in order to identify instances in which such persons are not properly using such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply in any case where the representative payee is a State institution. In such cases, the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish a system of accountability monitoring for institutions in each State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Clause (i) shall not apply in any case where the individual entitled to such payment is a resident of a Federal institution and the representative payee is the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Notwithstanding clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), the Commissioner of Social Security may require a report at any time from any representative payee, if the Commissioner of Social Security has reason to believe that the representative payee is misusing such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) A qualified organization may collect from an individual a monthly fee for expenses (including overhead) incurred by such organization in providing services performed as such individual's representative payee pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) if the fee does not exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) 10 percent of the monthly benefit involved, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) $25.00 per month ($50.00 per month in any case in which an individual is eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability and alcoholism or drug addiction is a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commissioner of Social Security shall adjust annually (after 1995) each dollar amount set forth in subclause (II) of this clause under procedures providing for adjustments in the same manner and to the same extent as adjustments are provided for under the procedures used to adjust benefit amounts under section 415(i)(2)(A) of this title, except that any amount so adjusted that is not a multiple of $1.00 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.00. Any agreement providing for a fee in excess of the amount permitted under this clause shall be void and shall be treated as misuse by the organization of such individual's benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified organization&rdquo; means any State or local government agency whose mission is to carry out income maintenance, social service, or health care-related activities, any State or local government agency with fiduciary responsibilities, or any community-based nonprofit social service agency, which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) is bonded or licensed in each State in which the agency serves as a representative payee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) in accordance with any applicable regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(aa) regularly provides services as a representative payee pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) or section 405(j)(4) of this title concurrently to 5 or more individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(bb) demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security that such agency is not otherwise a creditor of any such individual.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe regulations under which the Commissioner of Social Security may grant an exception from subclause (II)(bb) for any individual on a case-by-case basis if such exception is in the best interests of such individual.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1517 --><p class="statutory-body">(iii) Any qualified organization which knowingly charges or collects, directly or indirectly, any fee in excess of the maximum fee prescribed under clause (i) or makes any agreement, directly or indirectly, to charge or collect any fee in excess of such maximum fee, shall be fined in accordance with title 18, or imprisoned not more than 6 months, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In the case of an individual who is no longer eligible for benefits under this subchapter but to whom any amount of past-due benefits under this subchapter has not been paid, for purposes of clause (i), any amount of such past-due benefits payable in any month shall be treated as a monthly benefit referred to in clause (i)(I).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) <cap-smallcap>Restitution</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In cases where the negligent failure of the Commissioner of Social Security to investigate or monitor a representative payee results in misuse of benefits by the representative payee, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make payment to the beneficiary or the beneficiary's representative payee of an amount equal to such misused benefits. The Commissioner of Social Security shall make a good faith effort to obtain restitution from the terminated representative payee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) The Commissioner of Social Security shall include as a part of the annual report required under section 904&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1383_1_target" name="1383_1">1</a></sup> of this title information with respect to the implementation of the preceding provisions of this paragraph, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the number of cases in which the representative payee was changed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the number of cases discovered where there has been a misuse of funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) how any such cases were dealt with by the Commissioner of Social Security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the final disposition of such cases (including any criminal penalties imposed); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) such other information as the Commissioner of Social Security determines to be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(G) The Commissioner of Social Security shall make an initial report to each House of the Congress on the implementation of subparagraphs (B) and (C) within 270 days after October 9, 1984. The Commissioner of Social Security shall include in the annual report required under section 904&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1383_1_target" name="1383_1">1</a></sup> of this title, information with respect to the implementation of subparagraphs (B) and (C), including the same factors as are required to be included in the Commissioner's report under section 405(j)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Commissioner of Social Security may by regulation establish ranges of incomes within which a single amount of benefits under this subchapter shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commissioner of Social Security&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may make to any individual initially applying for benefits under this subchapter who is presumptively eligible for such benefits and who is faced with financial emergency a cash advance against such benefits, including any federally-administered State supplementary payments, in an amount not exceeding the monthly amount that would be payable to an eligible individual with no other income for the first month of such presumptive eligibility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may pay benefits under this subchapter to an individual applying for such benefits on the basis of disability or blindness for a period not exceeding 6 months prior to the determination of such individual's disability or blindness, if such individual is presumptively disabled or blind and is determined to be otherwise eligible for such benefits, and any benefits so paid prior to such determination shall in no event be considered overpayments for purposes of subsection (b) of this section solely because such individual is determined not to be disabled or blind.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Payment of the benefit of any individual who is an aged, blind, or disabled individual solely by reason of blindness (as determined under section 1382c(a)(2) of this title) or disability (as determined under section 1382c(a)(3) of this title), and who ceases to be blind or to be under such disability, shall continue (so long as such individual is otherwise eligible) through the second month following the month in which such blindness or disability ceases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, payment of the benefit of any individual who is an aged, blind, or disabled individual solely by reason of blindness (as determined under section 1382c(a)(2) of this title) or disability (as determined under section 1382c(a)(3) of this title) shall not be terminated or suspended because the blindness or other physical or mental impairment, on which the individual's eligibility for such benefit is based, has or may have ceased, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such individual is participating in a program of vocational rehabilitation services approved by the Commissioner of Social Security, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the completion of such program, or its continuation for a specified period of time, will increase the likelihood that such individual may (following his participation in such program) be permanently removed from the blindness and disability benefit rolls.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) In any case where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an individual is a recipient of benefits based on disability or blindness under this subchapter,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are payable is found to have ceased, not to have existed, or to no longer be disabling, and as a consequence such individual is determined not to be entitled to such benefits, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a timely request for review or for a hearing is pending with respect to the determination that he is not so entitled,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such individual may elect (in such manner and form and within such time as the Commissioner of Social Security shall by regulations prescribe) to have the payment of such benefits continued for an additional period beginning with the first month beginning after October 9, 1984, for which (under such determination) such benefits are no longer otherwise payable, and ending with the earlier of (I) the month preceding the month in which a decision is made after such a hearing, or (II) the month preceding the month in which no such request for review or a hearing is pending.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1518 --><p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If an individual elects to have the payment of his benefits continued for an additional period under subparagraph (A), and the final decision of the Commissioner of Social Security affirms the determination that he is not entitled to such benefits, any benefits paid under this subchapter pursuant to such election (for months in such additional period) shall be considered overpayments for all purposes of this subchapter, except as otherwise provided in clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the individual's appeal of his termination of benefits was made in good faith, all of the benefits paid pursuant to such individual's election under subparagraph (A) shall be subject to waiver consideration under the provisions of subsection (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The provisions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall apply with respect to determinations (that individuals are not entitled to benefits) which are made on or after October 9, 1984, or prior to such date but only on the basis of a timely request for review or for a hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) In any case in which an administrative law judge has determined after a hearing as provided in subsection (c) of this section that an individual is entitled to benefits based on disability or blindness under this subchapter and the Commissioner of Social Security has not issued the Commissioner's final decision in such case within 110 days after the date of the administrative law judge's determination, such benefits shall be currently paid for the months during the period beginning with the month in which such 110-day period expires and ending with the month in which such final decision is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), in determining whether the 110-day period referred to in subparagraph (A) has elapsed, any period of time for which the action or inaction of such individual or such individual's representative without good cause results in the delay in the issuance of the Commissioner's final decision shall not be taken into account to the extent that such period of time exceeds 20 calendar days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any benefits currently paid under this subchapter pursuant to this paragraph (for the months described in subparagraph (A)) shall not be considered overpayments for any purposes of this subchapter, unless payment of such benefits was fraudulently obtained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) Benefits under this subchapter shall not be denied to any individual solely by reason of the refusal of the individual to accept an amount offered as compensation for a crime of which the individual was a victim.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Overpayments and underpayments; adjustment, recovery, or payment of amounts by Commissioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security finds that more or less than the correct amount of benefits has been paid with respect to any individual, proper adjustment or recovery shall, subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, be made by appropriate adjustments in future payments to such individual or by recovery from such individual or his eligible spouse (or from the estate of either) or by payment to such individual or his eligible spouse, or, if such individual is deceased, by payment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to any surviving spouse of such individual, whether or not the individual's eligible spouse, if (within the meaning of the first sentence of section 402(i) of this title) such surviving husband or wife was living in the same household with the individual at the time of his death or within the 6 months immediately preceding the month of such death, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if such individual was a disabled or blind child who was living with his parent or parents at the time of his death or within the 6 months immediately preceding the month of such death, to such parent or parents.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commissioner of Social Security (i) shall make such provision as the Commissioner finds appropriate in the case of payment of more than the correct amount of benefits with respect to an individual with a view to avoiding penalizing such individual or his eligible spouse who was without fault in connection with the overpayment, if adjustment or recovery on account of such overpayment in such case would defeat the purposes of this subchapter, or be against equity and good conscience, or (because of the small amount involved) impede efficient or effective administration of this subchapter, and (ii) shall in any event make the adjustment or recovery (in the case of payment of more than the correct amount of benefits), in the case of an individual or eligible spouse receiving benefit payments under this subchapter (including supplementary payments of the type described in section 1382e(a) of this title and payments pursuant to an agreement entered into under section 212(a) of Public Law 93&ndash;66), in amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed (for any month) the lesser of (I) the amount of his or their benefit under this subchapter for that month or (II) an amount equal to 10 percent of his or their income for that month (including such benefit but excluding any other income excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title), unless fraud, willful misrepresentation, or concealment of material information was involved on the part of the individual or spouse in connection with the overpayment, or unless the individual requests that such adjustment or recovery be made at a higher or lower rate and the Commissioner of Social Security determines that adjustment or recovery at such rate is justified and appropriate. The availability (in the case of an individual who has been paid more than the correct amount of benefits) of procedures for adjustment or recovery at a limited rate under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall not, in and of itself, prevent or restrict the provision (in such case) of more substantial relief under clause (i) of such sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, when any payment of more than the correct amount is made to or on behalf of an individual who has died, and such payment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is made by direct deposit to a financial institution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is credited by the financial institution to a joint account of the deceased individual and another person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such other person is the surviving spouse of the deceased individual, and was eligible for a payment under this subchapter (including any State supplementation payment paid by <!-- PDFPage:1519 -->the Commissioner of Social Security) as an eligible spouse (or as either member of an eligible couple) for the month in which the deceased individual died,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the amount of such payment in excess of the correct amount shall be treated as a payment of more than the correct amount to such other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any overpayment with respect to an individual (or an individual and his or her spouse) is attributable solely to the ownership or possession by such individual (and spouse if any) of resources having a value which exceeds the applicable dollar figure specified in paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(B) of section 1382(a) of this title by $50 or less, such individual (and spouse if any) shall be deemed for purposes of the second sentence of paragraph (1) to have been without fault in connection with the overpayment, and no adjustment or recovery shall be made under the first sentence of such paragraph, unless the Commissioner of Social Security finds that the failure of such individual (and spouse if any) to report such value correctly and in a timely manner was knowing and willful.</p>

<p class="note-body">Enactment of subchapter XVI of the Social Security Act [this subchapter] by section 301 of Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, eff. Jan. 1, 1974, was not applicable to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. See section 303(b) of Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, set out as a note under section 301 of this title. Therefore, as to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, section 1605 of the Social Security Act [this section] as it existed prior to reenactment of this subchapter by Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, and as amended, continues to apply and to read as follows:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&sect;1385. Definitions</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;aid to the aged, blind, or disabled&rdquo; means money payments to needy individuals who are 65 years of age or older, are blind, or are 18 years of age or over and permanently and totally disabled, but such term does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) any such payments to or care in behalf of any individual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution); or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) any such payments to or care in behalf of any individual who has not attained 65 years of age and who is a patient in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Such term also includes payments which are not included within the meaning of such term under the preceding sentence, but which would be so included except that they are made on behalf of such a needy individual to another individual who (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Commissioner of So<!-- PDFPage:1537 -->cial Security) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such needy individual, but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 1382 of this title includes provision for&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) determination by the State agency that such needy individual has, by reason of his physical or mental condition, such inability to manage funds that making payments to him would be contrary to his welfare and, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid through payments described in this sentence;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) making such payments only in cases in which such payments will, under the rules otherwise applicable under the State plan for determining need and the amount of aid to the aged, blind, or disabled to be paid (and in conjunction with other income and resources), meet all the need [sic] of the individuals with respect to whom such payments are made;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) undertaking and continuing special efforts to protect the welfare of such individual and to improve, to the extent possible, his capacity for self-care and to manage funds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(D) periodic review by such State agency of the determination under clause (A) of this subsection to ascertain whether conditions justifying such determination still exist, with provision for termination of such payments if they do not and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative, as described in section 1311 of this title, if and when it appears that such action will best serve the interests of such needy individual; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(E) opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on the determination referred to in clause (A) of this subsection for any individual with respect to whom it is made.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">At the option of a State (if its plan approved under this subchapter so provides), such term (i) need not include money payments to an individual who has been absent from such State for a period in excess of ninety consecutive days (regardless of whether he has maintained his residence in such State during such period) until he has been present in such State for thirty consecutive days in the case of such an individual who has maintained his residence in such State during such period or ninety consecutive days in the case of any other such individual, and (ii) may include rent payments made directly to a public housing agency on behalf of a recipient or a group or groups of recipients of aid under such plan.</p>
