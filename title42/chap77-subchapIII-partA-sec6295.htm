<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Criteria for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a covered product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed by the Secretary under this section for any type (or class) of covered product shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water efficiency, which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In determining whether a standard is economically justified, the Secretary shall, after receiving views and comments furnished with respect to the proposed standard, determine whether the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatest extent practicable, considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the total projected amount of energy, or as applicable, water, savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) the impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VI) the need for national energy and water conservation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VII) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(V), the Attorney General shall make a determination of the impact, if any, of any lessening of competition likely to result from such standard and shall transmit such determination, not later than 60 days after the publication of a proposed rule prescribing or amending an energy conservation standard, in writing to the Secretary, together with an analysis of the nature and extent of such impact. Any such determination and analysis shall be published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy, and as applicable, water, savings during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary's determination of whether a standard is economically justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section for a type (or class) of covered product if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for products other than dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, and kitchen ranges and ovens, a test procedure has not been prescribed pursuant to section 6293 of this title with respect to that type (or class) of product; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Procedure for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard shall be prescribed in accordance with the following procedure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A proposed rule which prescribes an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribes no amendment or no new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published in the Federal Register. In prescribing any such proposed rule with respect to a standard, the Secretary shall determine the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible for each type (or class) of covered products. If such standard is not designed to achieve such efficiency or use, the Secretary shall state in the proposed rule the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) After the publication of such proposed rulemaking, the Secretary shall, in accordance with section 6306 of this title, afford interested persons an opportunity, during a period of not less than 60 days, to present oral and written comments (including an opportunity to question those who make such presentations, as provided in such section) on matters relating to such proposed rule, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the standard to be prescribed is economically justified (taking into account those factors which the Secretary must consider under subsection (<em>o</em>)(2) of this section) or will result in the effects described in subsection (<em>o</em>)(4) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the standard will achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which is technologically feasible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the standard will not achieve such improvement, whether the reasons for not achieving such improvement are adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether such rule should prescribe a level of energy use or efficiency which is higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply in the case of any group of products within the type (or class) that will be subject to such standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A final rule prescribing an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribing no amended or new standard for a type (or <!-- PDFPage:5171 -->class) of covered products shall be published as soon as is practicable, but not less than 90 days, after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Direct final rules.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On receipt of a statement that is submitted jointly by interested persons that are fairly representative of relevant points of view (including representatives of manufacturers of covered products, States, and efficiency advocates), as determined by the Secretary, and contains recommendations with respect to an energy or water conservation standard&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the Secretary determines that the recommended standard contained in the statement is in accordance with subsection (<em>o</em>) or section 6313(a)(6)(B) of this title, as applicable, the Secretary may issue a final rule that establishes an energy or water conservation standard and is published simultaneously with a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposes a new or amended energy or water conservation standard that is identical to the standard established in the final rule to establish the recommended standard (referred to in this paragraph as a &ldquo;direct final rule&rdquo;); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the Secretary determines that a direct final rule cannot be issued based on the statement, the Secretary shall publish a notice of the determination, together with an explanation of the reasons for the determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Public comment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall solicit public comment for a period of at least 110 days with respect to each direct final rule issued by the Secretary under subparagraph (A)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Withdrawal of direct final rules.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 120 days after the date on which a direct final rule issued under subparagraph (A)(i) is published in the Federal Register, the Secretary shall withdraw the direct final rule if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the Secretary receives 1 or more adverse public comments relating to the direct final rule under subparagraph (B)(i)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6295_4_target" name="6295_4">4</a></sup> or any alternative joint recommendation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) based on the rulemaking record relating to the direct final rule, the Secretary determines that such adverse public comments or alternative joint recommendation may provide a reasonable basis for withdrawing the direct final rule under subsection (<em>o</em>), section 6313(a)(6)(B) of this title, or any other applicable law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Action on withdrawal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On withdrawal of a direct final rule under clause (i), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) publish in the Federal Register the reasons why the direct final rule was withdrawn.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of withdrawn direct final rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A direct final rule that is withdrawn under clause (i) shall not be considered to be a final rule for purposes of subsection (<em>o</em>).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Effect of paragraph</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this paragraph authorizes the Secretary to issue a direct final rule based solely on receipt of more than 1 statement containing recommended standards relating to the direct final rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Special rule for certain types or classes of products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A rule prescribing an energy conservation standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall specify a level of energy use or efficiency higher or lower than that which applies (or would apply) for such type (or class) for any group of covered products which have the same function or intended use, if the Secretary determines that covered products within such group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered products within such type (or class); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have a capacity or other performance-related feature which other products within such type (or class) do not have and such feature justifies a higher or lower standard from that which applies (or will apply) to other products within such type (or class).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under this paragraph concerning whether a performance-related feature justifies the establishment of a higher or lower standard, the Secretary shall consider such factors as the utility to the consumer of such a feature, and such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any rule prescribing a higher or lower level of energy use or efficiency under paragraph (1) shall include an explanation of the basis on which such higher or lower level was established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Inclusion in standards of test procedures and other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed under this section shall include, where applicable, test procedures prescribed in accordance with section 6293 of this title and may include any requirement which the Secretary determines is necessary to assure that each covered product to which such standard applies meets the required minimum level of energy efficiency or maximum quantity of energy use specified in such standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Determination of compliance with standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Compliance with, and performance under, the energy conservation standards (except for design standards authorized by this part) established in, or prescribed under, this section shall be determined using the test procedures and corresponding compliance criteria prescribed under section 6293 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Small manufacturer exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may, on application of any manufacturer, ex<!-- PDFPage:5172 -->empt such manufacturer from all or part of the requirements of any energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under this section for any period not longer than the 24-month period beginning on the date such rule becomes effective, if the Secretary finds that the annual gross revenues of such manufacturer from all its operations (including the manufacture and sale of covered products) does not exceed $8,000,000 for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application. In making such finding with respect to any manufacturer, the Secretary shall take into account the annual gross revenues of any other person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such manufacturer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not exercise the authority granted under paragraph (1) with respect to any type (or class) of covered product subject to an energy conservation standard under this section unless the Secretary makes a finding, after obtaining the written views of the Attorney General, that a failure to allow an exemption under paragraph (1) would likely result in a lessening of competition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(u) Battery charger and external power supply electric energy consumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Not later than 18 months after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall, after providing notice and an opportunity for comment, prescribe, by rule, definitions and test procedures for the power use of battery chargers and external power supplies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) <cap-smallcap>External power supplies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 2 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall issue a final rule that determines whether energy conservation standards shall be issued for external power supplies or classes of external power supplies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) <cap-smallcap>Battery chargers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than July 1, 2011, the Secretary shall issue a final rule that prescribes energy conservation standards for battery chargers or classes of battery chargers or determine that no energy conservation standard is technically feasible and economically justified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For each product class, any energy conservation standards issued under clause (i) shall be set at the lowest level of energy use that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) meets the criteria and procedures of subsections (<em>o</em>), (p), (q), (r), (s), and (t) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) would result in significant overall annual energy savings, considering standby mode and other operating modes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary and the Administrator shall collaborate and develop programs (including programs under section 6294a of this title and other voluntary industry agreements or codes of conduct) that are designed to reduce standby mode energy use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Efficiency standards for class a external power supplies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subparagraphs (B) through (D), a class A external power supply manufactured on or after the later of July 1, 2008, or December 19, 2007, shall meet the following standards:</p>
