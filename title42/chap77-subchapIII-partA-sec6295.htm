<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall grant a petition if he finds that it contains evidence which, assuming no other evidence were considered, provides an adequate basis for amending the standards under the following criteria&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) amended standards will result in significant conservation of energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) amended standards are technologically feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) amended standards are cost effective as described in subsection (<em>o</em>)(2)(B)(i)(II) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The grant of a petition by the Secretary under this subsection creates no presumption with respect to the Secretary's determination of any of the criteria in a rulemaking under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An amendment prescribed under this subsection shall apply to products manufactured after a date which is 5 years after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effective date of the previous amendment pursuant to this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the previous final rule published under this part did not amend the standard, the earliest date by which a previous amendment could have been in effect, except that in no case may an amended standard apply to products manufactured within 3 years (for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, general service fluorescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, and kitchen ranges and ovens) or 5 years (for central air conditioners and heat pumps, water heaters, pool heaters, direct heating equipment and furnaces) after publication of the final rule establishing a standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Criteria for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, <!-- PDFPage:4386 -->water use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a covered product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed by the Secretary under this section for any type (or class) of covered product shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water efficiency, which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In determining whether a standard is economically justified, the Secretary shall, after receiving views and comments furnished with respect to the proposed standard, determine whether the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatest extent practicable, considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the total projected amount of energy, or as applicable, water, savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) the impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VI) the need for national energy and water conservation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VII) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(V), the Attorney General shall make a determination of the impact, if any, of any lessening of competition likely to result from such standard and shall transmit such determination, not later than 60 days after the publication of a proposed rule prescribing or amending an energy conservation standard, in writing to the Secretary, together with an analysis of the nature and extent of such impact. Any such determination and analysis shall be published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy, and as applicable, water, savings during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary's determination of whether a standard is economically justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section for a type (or class) of covered product if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for products other than dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, and kitchen ranges and ovens, a test procedure has not been prescribed pursuant to section 6293 of this title with respect to that type (or class) of product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines, by rule, that the establishment of such standard will not result in significant conservation of energy or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water, or that the establishment of such standard is not technologically feasible or economically justified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of section 6297 of this title, a determination under subparagraph (B) with respect to any type (or class) of covered products shall have the same effect as would a standard prescribed for such type (or class).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the standard is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States in any covered product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some types (or classes) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a standard for other types (or classes).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Procedure for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard shall be prescribed in accordance with the following procedure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which specifies the type (or class) of covered products to which the rule may apply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall invite interested persons to submit, within 60 days after the date of publication of such advance notice, written presentations of data, views, and arguments in response to such notice; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may identify proposed or amended standards that may be prescribed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A proposed rule which prescribes an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribes no amendment or no new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published in the Federal Register. In prescribing any such proposed rule with respect to a standard, the Secretary shall determine the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible for each type (or class) of covered products. If such standard is not designed to achieve such efficiency or use, the Secretary shall state in the proposed rule the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) After the publication of such proposed rulemaking, the Secretary shall, in accordance with section 6306 of this title, afford interested persons an opportunity, during a pe<!-- PDFPage:4387 -->riod of not less than 60 days, to present oral and written comments (including an opportunity to question those who make such presentations, as provided in such section) on matters relating to such proposed rule, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the standard to be prescribed is economically justified (taking into account those factors which the Secretary must consider under subsection (<em>o</em>)(2) of this section) or will result in the effects described in subsection (<em>o</em>)(4) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the standard will achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which is technologically feasible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the standard will not achieve such improvement, whether the reasons for not achieving such improvement are adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether such rule should prescribe a level of energy use or efficiency which is higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply in the case of any group of products within the type (or class) that will be subject to such standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A final rule prescribing an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribing no amended or new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published as soon as is practicable, but not less than 90 days, after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Special rule for certain types or classes of products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A rule prescribing an energy conservation standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall specify a level of energy use or efficiency higher or lower than that which applies (or would apply) for such type (or class) for any group of covered products which have the same function or intended use, if the Secretary determines that covered products within such group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered products within such type (or class); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have a capacity or other performance-related feature which other products within such type (or class) do not have and such feature justifies a higher or lower standard from that which applies (or will apply) to other products within such type (or class).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under this paragraph concerning whether a performance-related feature justifies the establishment of a higher or lower standard, the Secretary shall consider such factors as the utility to the consumer of such a feature, and such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any rule prescribing a higher or lower level of energy use or efficiency under paragraph (1) shall include an explanation of the basis on which such higher or lower level was established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Inclusion in standards of test procedures and other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed under this section shall include, where applicable, test procedures prescribed in accordance with section 6293 of this title and may include any requirement which the Secretary determines is necessary to assure that each covered product to which such standard applies meets the required minimum level of energy efficiency or maximum quantity of energy use specified in such standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Determination of compliance with standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Compliance with, and performance under, the energy conservation standards (except for design standards authorized by this part) established in, or prescribed under, this section shall be determined using the test procedures and corresponding compliance criteria prescribed under section 6293 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Small manufacturer exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may, on application of any manufacturer, exempt such manufacturer from all or part of the requirements of any energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under this section for any period not longer than the 24-month period beginning on the date such rule becomes effective, if the Secretary finds that the annual gross revenues of such manufacturer from all its operations (including the manufacture and sale of covered products) does not exceed $8,000,000 for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application. In making such finding with respect to any manufacturer, the Secretary shall take into account the annual gross revenues of any other person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such manufacturer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not exercise the authority granted under paragraph (1) with respect to any type (or class) of covered product subject to an energy conservation standard under this section unless the Secretary makes a finding, after obtaining the written views of the Attorney General, that a failure to allow an exemption under paragraph (1) would likely result in a lessening of competition.</p>

<p class="note-body">1978&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 95&ndash;619 substituted provisions authorizing Secretary to prescribe an energy efficiency standard for each type of covered product specified in section 6292(a)(1) to (13) of this title, authorizing such prescription for any type of covered product specified in section 6292(a)(14) of this title where certain conditions are found to exist, and requiring publication of a list of those types of covered products considered subject to prescribed standards in the Federal Register not later than two years after Nov. 9, 1978, for provisions requiring the Administrator, meaning the Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, to direct the National Bureau of Standards to develop an energy efficiency improvement target for each type of covered product listed in section 6292(a)(1) to (10) of this title, requiring prescription of such a target by the Administrator not later than ninety days after Aug. 14, 1976, requiring such targets be designed to exceed by 1980 by at least twenty percent the aggregate energy efficiency of the covered products as manufactured in 1972, requiring similar energy efficiency targets be prescribed for covered products specified in section 6292(a)(11) to (13) of this title not later than one year after Aug. 14, 1976, authorizing the Administrator to modify periodically any established targets, requiring the manufacturers of any covered products to submit reports as requested by the Administrator to help in establishing and reaching such targets, authorizing the Administrator to commence proceedings in certain situations to prescribe initial or revised targets, specifying when improvements of energy efficiency are economically justified, and authorizing the Attorney General to determine any negative effects on competition so as to make certain improvements economically unjustified.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (b). Pub. L. 95&ndash;619 substituted provisions specifying preconditions for prescription of a standard for a type or class of covered products for provisions specifying the procedure to be followed in prescribing energy efficiency standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 95&ndash;619 substituted provisions requiring energy efficiency standards for each type of covered products be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which the Secretary determines feasible and justified and requiring such standards be phased in over a period not to exceed five years for provisions relating to the prescription of test procedures and the requirements necessary to meet minimum energy efficiency levels.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (d). Pub. L. 95&ndash;619 substituted provisions relating to a determination by the Secretary of the economic justification of any particular energy efficiency standard and a determination by the Attorney General of the impact on competition of any proposed standard for provisions relating to labeling rules.</p>
