<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1441. Congressional declaration of national housing policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the general welfare and security of the Nation and the health and living standards of its people require housing production and related community development sufficient to remedy the serious housing shortage, the elimination of substandard and other inadequate housing through the clearance of slums and blighted areas, and the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family, thus contributing to the development and redevelopment of communities and to the advancement of the growth, wealth, and security of the Nation. The Congress further declares that such production is necessary to enable the housing industry to make its full contribution toward an economy of maximum employment, production, and purchasing power. The policy to be followed in attaining the national housing objective established shall be: (1) private enterprise shall be encouraged to serve as large a part of the total need as it can; (2) governmental assistance shall be utilized where feasible to enable private enterprise to serve more of the total need; (3) appropriate local public bodies shall be encouraged and assisted to undertake positive programs of encouraging and assisting the development of well-planned, integrated residential neighborhoods, the development and redevelopment of communities, and the production, at lower costs, of housing of sound standards of design, construction, livability, and size for adequate family life; (4) governmental assistance to eliminate substandard and other inadequate housing through the clearance of slums and blighted areas, to facilitate community development and redevelopment, and to provide adequate housing for urban and rural nonfarm families with incomes so low that they are not being decently housed in new or existing housing shall be extended to those localities which estimate their own needs and demonstrate that these needs are not being met through reliance solely upon private enterprise, and without such aid; and (5) governmental assistance for decent, safe, and sanitary farm dwellings and related facilities shall be extended where the farm owner demonstrates that he lacks sufficient resources to provide such housing on his own account and is unable to secure necessary credit for such housing from other sources on terms and conditions which he could reasonably be expected to fulfill. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, and any other departments or agencies of the Federal Government having powers, functions, or duties with respect to housing, shall exercise their powers, functions, and duties under this or any other law, consistently with the national housing policy declared by this Act and in such manner as will facilitate sustained progress in attaining the national housing objective hereby established, and in such manner as will encourage and assist (1) the production of housing of sound standards of design, construction, livability, and size for adequate family life; (2) the reduction of the costs of housing without sacrifice of such sound standards; (3) the use of new designs, materials, techniques, and methods in residential construction, the use of standardized dimensions and methods of assembly of home-building materials and equipment, and the increase of efficiency in residential construction and maintenance; (4) the development of well-planned, integrated, residential neighborhoods and the development and redevelopment of communities; and (5) the stabilization of the housing industry at a high annual volume of residential construction.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1441a. National housing goals</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and reaffirmation of goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the supply of the Nation's housing is not increasing rapidly enough to meet the national housing goal, established in the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.], of the &ldquo;realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family&rdquo;. The Congress reaffirms this national housing goal and determines that it can be substantially achieved within the next decade by the construction or rehabilitation of twenty-six million housing units, six million of these for low and moderate income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that policies designed to contribute to the achievement of the national housing goal have not directed sufficient attention and resources to the preservation of existing housing and neighborhoods, that the deterioration and abandonment of housing for the Nation's lower income families has accelerated over the last decade, and that this acceleration has contributed to neighborhood disintegration and has partially negated the progress toward achieving the national housing goal which has been made primarily through new housing construction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Congressional declaration of purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that if the national housing goal is to be achieved, a greater effort must be made to encourage the preservation of existing housing and neighborhoods through such measures as housing preservation, moderate rehabilitation, and improvements in housing management and maintenance, in conjunction with the provision of adequate municipal services. Such an effort should concentrate, to a greater extent than it has in the past, on housing and neighborhoods where deterioration is evident but has not yet become acute.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prerequisites; purposes; amounts; terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make a loan, grant, or combined loan and grant to an eligible very low-income applicant in order to improve or modernize a rural dwelling, to make the dwelling safer or more sanitary, or to remove hazards. The Secretary may make a loan or grant under this subsection to the applicant to cover the cost of any or all repairs, improvements, or additions such as repairing roofs, providing sanitary waste facilities, providing a convenient and sanitary water supply, repairing or providing structural supports, or making similar repairs, additions, improvements, including all preliminary and installation costs in obtaining central water and sewer service. The maximum amount of a grant, a loan, or a loan and grant shall not exceed such limitations as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Any portion of the sums advanced to the borrower treated as a loan shall be secured and be repayable within twenty years in accordance with the principles and conditions set forth in this subchapter, except that a loan for less than $2,500 need be evidenced only by a promissory note. Sums made available by grant may be made subject to the conditions set forth in this subchapter for the protection of the Government with respect to contributions made on loans made by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage adequate family-size farms the Secretary may make loans under this section and section 1473 of this title to any applicant whose farm needs enlargement or development in order to provide income sufficient to support decent, safe, and sanitary housing and other farm buildings, and may use the funds made available under clause (b) of section 1483 of this title for such purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Weatherization program; development, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to other duties specified in this section, the Secretary shall develop and conduct a weatherization program for the purpose of making grants to finance the purchase or installation, or both, of weatherization materials in dwelling units occupied by low-income families. Such grants shall be made to low-income families who own dwelling units or, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), to owners of such units for the benefit of the low-income tenants residing therein. In making grants under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to the weatherization of dwelling units occupied by low-income elderly or handicapped persons. The Secretary shall, in carrying out this section, consult with the Director of the Community Services Administration and the Secretary of Energy for the purpose of coordinating the weatherization program under this subsection, section 2809(a)(12) of this title, and part A of the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. 6861 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any grant made under this subsection to an owner of a rental dwelling unit the Secretary shall provide that (A) the benefits of weatherization assistance in connection with such unit will accrue primarily to the low-income family residing therein, (B) the rents on such dwelling unit will not be raised because of any increase in value thereof due solely to weatherization assistance provided under this subsection, and (C) no undue or excessive enhancement will occur to the value of such unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall (A) implement the weatherization standards described in paragraphs (2)(A) and (3) of section 413(b) of the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. 6863(b)], and (B) provide that, with respect to any dwelling unit, not more than $800 of any grant made under this section be expended on weatherization materials and related matters described in section 415(c) of the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. 6865(c)], <!-- PDFPage:2608 -->except that the Secretary shall increase such amount to not more than $1,500 to cover labor costs in areas where the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, determines there is an insufficient number of volunteers and training participants and public service employment workers, assisted pursuant to the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] or the Older American Community Service Employment Act [42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.], available to work on weatherization projects under the supervision of qualified supervisors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;elderly,&rdquo; &ldquo;handicapped person,&rdquo; &ldquo;low income,&rdquo; and &ldquo;weatherization materials&rdquo; shall have the same meanings given such terms in paragraphs (3), (5), (7), and (9), respectively, of section 412 of the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. 6862].</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Moratorium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During any time that any such loan is outstanding, the Secretary is authorized under regulations to be prescribed by him to grant a moratorium upon the payment of interest and principal on such loan for so long a period as he deems necessary, upon a showing by the borrower that due to circumstances beyond his control, he is unable to continue making payments of such principal and interest when due without unduly impairing his standard of living. In cases of extreme hardship under the foregoing circumstances, the Secretary is further authorized to cancel interest due and payable on such loans during the moratorium. Should any foreclosure of such a mortgage securing such a loan upon which a moratorium has been granted occur, no deficiency judgment shall be taken against the mortgagor if he shall have faithfully tried to meet his obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foreclosure procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In foreclosing on any mortgage held by the Secretary under this subchapter, the Secretary shall follow the foreclosure procedures of the State in which the property involved is located to the extent such procedures are more favorable to the borrower than the foreclosure procedures that would otherwise be followed by the Secretary. This subsection shall be subject to the availability of amounts approved in appropriations Acts, to the extent additional budget authority is necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to insure and make commitments to insure loans made by lenders other than the United States to the owner of any farm or any association of farmers for the purpose of providing housing and related facilities for domestic farm labor, or to any Indian tribe for such purpose, or to any State (or political subdivision thereof), or any broad-based public or private nonprofit organization or any nonprofit organization of farmworkers incorporated within the State for the purpose of providing housing and related facilities for domestic farm labor any place within the State where a need exists. All such loans shall be made in accordance with terms and conditions substantially identical with those specified in section 1472 of this title, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no such loan shall be insured in an amount in excess of the value of the farm involved less any prior liens in the case of a loan to an individual owner of a farm, or the total estimated value of the structures and facilities with respect to which the loan is made in the case of any other loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no such loan shall be insured if it bears interest at a rate in excess of 1 per centum per annum;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) out of interest payments by the borrower the Secretary shall retain a charge in an amount not less than one-half of 1 per centum per annum of the unpaid principal balance of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the insurance contracts and agreements with respect to any loan may contain provisions for servicing the loan by the Secretary or by the lender, and for the purchase by the Secretary of the loan if it is not in default, on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Secretary may take mortgages creating a lien running to the United States for the benefit of the insurance fund referred to in subsection (b) of this section notwithstanding the fact that the note may be held by the lender or his assignee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the notes and security therefor acquired by the Secretary under insurance contracts made pursuant to this section shall become a part of the insurance fund. Loans insured under this section may be held in the fund and collected in accordance with their terms or may be sold and reinsured. All proceeds from such collections, including the liquidation of security and the proceeds of sales, shall become a part of the insurance fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) of the charges retained by the Secretary out of interest payments by the borrower, amounts not less than one-half of 1 per centum per annum of the unpaid principal balance of the loan shall be deposited in and become a part of the insurance fund. The remainder of such charges shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States and shall be available for administrative expenses of the Farmers Home Administration, to be transferred annually to and become merged with any appropriation for such expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insurance contract; obligation of United States; incontestability</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no such loan shall exceed the development cost or the value of the security, whichever is less;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such a loan may be made for a period of up to 30 years from the making of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such a loan, when made to a consumer cooperative for cooperative housing purposes, may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be made upon the condition that any person who is admitted as an eligible member and tenant of the cooperative may not subsequently be deprived of his membership or tenancy by reason of his no longer meeting the income eligibility requirements established by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">There is authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $50,000,000, which shall constitute a revolving fund to be used by the Secretary in carrying out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insurance of loans; authorization; terms and conditions; utilization of Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund; expiration date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to insure and make commitments to insure loans made to any individual, corporation, association, trust, Indian tribe, or partnership to provide rental or cooperative housing and related facilities for elderly or handicapped persons or families or other persons and families of moderate income in rural areas, in accordance with terms and conditions substantially identical with those specified in section 1472 of this title; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no such loan shall exceed the development cost or the value of the security, whichever is less;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such a loan may be made for a period of up to 30 years from the making of the loan, but the Secretary may provide for periodic payments based on an amortization schedule of 50 years with a final payment of the balance due at the end of the term of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for insuring such loans, the Secretary shall utilize the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund subject to all the provisions of section 1929 of title 7 and the second and third sentences of section 1928&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1485_1_target" name="1485_1">1</a></sup> of title 7, including the authority in section 1929(f)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1485_1_target" name="1485_1">1</a></sup> of title 7 to utilize the insurance fund to make, sell, and insure loans which could be insured under this subsection; but the aggregate of the principal amounts of such loans made by the Secretary and not disposed of shall not exceed $10,000,000 outstanding at any one time; and the Secretary may take liens running to the United States though the notes may be held by other lenders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) no loan shall be insured under this subsection after September 30, 1998;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such a loan, when made to a consumer cooperative for cooperative housing purposes, may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be made upon the condition that any person who is admitted as an eligible member and tenant of the cooperative may not subsequently be deprived of his membership or tenancy by reason of his no longer meeting the income eligibility requirements established by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) loans may be made to owners who are otherwise eligible under this section to purchase and convert single-family residences to rental units of two or more dwellings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Secretary may make a new loan to the current borrower to finance the final payment of the original loan for an additional period not to exceed twenty years, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it is more cost-efficient and serves the tenant base more effectively to maintain the current property than to build a new property in the same location; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the property has been maintained to such an extent that it warrants retention in the current portfolio because it can be expected to continue providing decent, safe, and affordable rental units for the balance of the loan; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) current market studies show that a need for low-income rural rental housing still exists for that area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any other criteria established by the Secretary has been met.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Equity recapture loans and loans to nonprofit organizations and public agencies</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Construction requirements; detached units for cooperative housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No loan shall be made or insured under subsection (a) or (b) of this section unless the Secretary finds that the construction involved will be undertaken in an economical manner and will not be of elaborate or extravagant design or materials. However, specifically designed equipment required by elderly or handicapped persons or families shall not be considered elaborate or extravagant. A loan may be made or insured under subsection (a) or (b) of this section with respect to detached units, including those on scattered sites, for cooperative housing.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Application; considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the application of any State or political subdivision thereof, or any Indian tribe, or any broad-based public or private nonprofit organization incorporated within the State, or any nonprofit organization of farmworkers incorporated within the State, the Secretary is authorized to provide financial assistance for the provision of low-rent housing and related facilities (which may be located any place within the State) for domestic farm labor, if he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the housing and related facilities for which financial assistance is requested will fulfill a pressing need in the area in which such housing and facilities will be located, and there is reasonable doubt that the same can be provided without financial assistance under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the applicant will contribute, from its own resources or from funds borrowed under section 1484 of this title or elsewhere, at least 10 per centum of the total development cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the types of housing and related facilities to be provided are most practicable, giving due consideration to the purposes to be served thereby and the needs of the occupants thereof, and such housing and facilities shall be durable and suitable for year-around occupancy or use, unless the Secretary finds that there is no need for such year-around occupancy or use in that area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the construction will be undertaken in an economical manner, and the housing and related facilities will not be of elaborate or extravagant design or material.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Maximum amount of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of any financial assistance provided under this section for low-rent housing and related facilities shall not exceed 90 per centum of the total development cost thereof, as determined by the Secretary, less such amount as the Secretary determines can be practicably obtained from other sources (including a loan under section 1484 of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prerequisite agreements; rentals; safety and sanitation standards; priority of domestic farm labor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No financial assistance for low-rent housing and related facilities shall be made available under this section unless, to any extent and for any periods required by the Secretary, the applicant agrees&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the rentals charged domestic farm labor shall not exceed such amounts as may be approved by the Secretary, giving due consideration to the income and earning capacity of the tenants, and the necessary costs of operating and maintaining such housing;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2632 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that such housing shall be maintained at all times in a safe and sanitary condition in accordance with such standards as may be prescribed by State or local law, or, in the absence of such standards, in accordance with such minimum requirements as the Secretary shall prescribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an absolute priority will be given at all times in granting occupancy of such housing and facilities to domestic farm labor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments; contracts to specify uses of housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make payments pursuant to any contract for financial assistance under this section at such times and in such manner, as may be specified in the contract. In each contract, the Secretary shall include such covenants, conditions, or provisions as he deems necessary to insure that the housing and related facilities, for which financial assistance is made available, be used only in conformity with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations for prevention of waste</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to insure that Federal funds expended under this section are not wasted or dissipated. The Secretary shall not give priority for funding under this section to any one of the groups listed in subsection (a) of this section over any of the others so listed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Wages; labor standards; waiver; authority and functions of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors on projects assisted by the Secretary which are undertaken by approved applicants under this section shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act, as amended (40 U.S.C. 276a&mdash;276a&ndash;5). The Secretary shall not extend any financial assistance under this section for any project without first obtaining adequate assurance that these labor standards will be maintained on the construction work; except that compliance with such standards may be waived by the Secretary in cases or classes of cases where laborers or mechanics, not otherwise employed at any time on the project, voluntarily donate their services without compensation for the purpose of lowering the costs of construction and the Secretary determines that any amounts thereby saved are fully credited to the person, corporation, association, organization, or other entity, undertaking the project. The Secretary of Labor shall have, with respect to the labor standards specified in this section, the authority and functions set forth in Reorganization Plan Numbered 14 of 1950 (15 F.R. 3176; 64 Stat. 1267), and section 276c of title 40.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to make and insure loans for housing and buildings on adequate farms; amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may insure loans meeting the requirements of section 1472 of this title, and <!-- PDFPage:2635 -->may make loans in accordance with the requirements of such section to be sold and insured. The amount of such a loan to a low income person or family shall not exceed the amount necessary to provide adequate housing which is modest in size, design, and cost (as determined by the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority to make and insure loans for housing and related facilities for domestic farm labor and elderly persons; transfer of notes, contracts, and mortgages from Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund; compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may insure loans in accordance with the requirements of section 1484 of this title (exclusive of subsections (a)(3), (a)(5), and (b) thereof), 1485 of this title (exclusive of subsections (a) and (b)(3) thereof), 1490d, and 1490f of this title, and may make loans meeting such requirements to be sold and insured. Upon the expiration of ninety days after the original capitalization of the Rural Housing Insurance Fund, created by subsection (e) of this section, no new loans shall be made or insured under section 1484 or 1485(b) of this title, except in conformity with this section. The notes held in the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund (section 1929 of title 7) which evidence loans made or insured by the Secretary under section 1484 or 1485(b) of this title, the rights and liabilities of that Fund under insurance contracts relating to such loans held by insured investors, the mortgages securing the obligations of the borrowers under such loans held in the Fund or by insured investors, and all rights to subsequent collections on and proceeds of such notes, contracts, and mortgages, are hereby transferred to the Rural Housing Insurance Fund and for the purposes of this subchapter and any other Act shall be subject to the provisions of this section as if created pursuant thereto. The Rural Housing Insurance Fund shall compensate the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund for the aggregate unpaid principal balance plus accrued interest of the notes so transferred.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authority to insure payment of interest and principal; liens; assignability of notes evidencing loans; interest subsidy on insured and guaranteed loans offered for sale to public; protection of borrowers under loans sold to public</h4>

Any contract of insurance executed by the Secretary hereunder shall be an obligation supported by the full faith and credit of the United States, and shall be incontestable except for fraud or material misrepresentation of which the holder has actual knowledge. In connection with loans insured under this section, the Secretary may take liens running to the United States notwithstanding the fact that the notes evidencing such loans may be held by lenders other than the United States. Notes evidencing such loans shall be freely assignable, but the Secretary shall not be bound by any such assignment until notice thereof is given to and acknowledged by him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each loan made by the Secretary or other lenders under this subchapter that is insured or guaranteed in accordance with this subsection shall, when offered for sale to the public, be accompanied by an agreement by the Secretary to pay to the holder of such loan (through an agreement to purchase such loan or through such other means as the Secretary determines to be appropriate) the difference between the rate of interest paid by the borrower of such loan and the market rate of interest (as determined by the Secretary) on obligations having comparable periods to maturity on the date of such sale.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each loan made by the Secretary or other lenders under this subchapter that is insured or guaranteed in accordance with this subsection shall, when offered for sale to the public, be accompanied by agreements for the benefit of the borrower under the loan that provide that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) upon any substantial default of the borrower, but prior to foreclosure, the loan shall be assigned to the Secretary for the purpose of avoiding foreclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) following any assignment under subparagraph (B) and before commencing any action to foreclose or otherwise dispossess the borrower, the Secretary shall afford the borrower all substantive and procedural rights arising under this subchapter, including consideration for interest subsidy, moratorium, reamortization, refinancing, and appeal of any adverse decision to an impartial officer.</p>

There are authorized to be ap<!-- PDFPage:2636 -->propriated to the Secretary such sums as may be necessary for the purposes of the Fund.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Investment of excess Fund moneys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Money in the Fund not needed for current operations shall be invested in direct obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed by the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">All funds, claims, notes, mortgages, contracts, and property acquired by the Secretary under this section, and all collections and proceeds therefrom, shall constitute assets of the Fund; and all liabilities and obligations of such assets shall be liabilities and obligations of the Fund. Loans may be held in the Fund and collected in accordance with their terms or may be sold by the Secretary with or without agreements for insurance thereof. The Secretary is authorized to make agreements with respect to servicing loans held or insured by him under this section and purchasing such insured loans on such terms and conditions as he may prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury to obtain funds necessary for discharging obligations under this section and for authorized expenditures out of the Fund, but, except as may be authorized in appropriation Acts, not for the original or any additional capital of the Fund. Such notes shall be in such form and denominations and have such maturities and be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. Each note shall bear interest at the average rate, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, payable by the Treasury upon its marketable public obligations outstanding at the beginning of the fiscal year in which such note is issued, which are neither due nor callable for redemption for fifteen years from their date of issue. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes of the Secretary issued hereunder, and for that purpose the Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which such securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include purchases of notes issued by the Secretary. All redemption, purchases, and sales by the Secretary of the Treasury of such notes shall be treated as public debt transactions of the United States. The notes issued by the Secretary to the Secretary of the Treasury shall constitute obligations of the Fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may retain out of interest payments by the borrower an annual charge in an amount specified in the insurance or sale agreement applicable to the loan.

Any retained charges not deposited in the Fund shall be available for administrative expenses in carrying out the provisions of this subchapter, to be transferred annually, and become merged with any appropriation for administrative expenses of the Farmers Home Administration, when and in such amounts as may be authorized in appropriation Acts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Additional uses of Fund moneys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may also utilize the Fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to pay amounts to which the holder of the note is entitled in accordance with an insurance or sale agreement under this section accruing between the date of any payment by the borrower to the Secretary and the date of transmittal of any such payments to the holder of the note; and in the discretion of the Secretary, payments other than final payments need not be remitted to the holder until due or until the next agreed annual or semiannual remittance date;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Sale of loans as sale of assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any sale by the Secretary of loans individually or in blocks, pursuant to subsections (c) and (g) of this section, shall be treated as a sale of assets for the purposes of chapter 11 of title 31, notwithstanding the fact that the Secretary, under an agreement with the purchaser, holds the debt instruments evidencing the loans and holds or reinvests payments thereon as trustee and custodian for the purchaser.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2637 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Commitments to make or insure loans to lenders, builders, or sellers; terms and conditions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 1472, 1487(a) and 1485 of this title, loans to persons of low or moderate income under section 1472 or 1487(a)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1490a_1_target" name="1490a_1">1</a></sup> of this title, loans under section 1485 of this title to provide rental or cooperative housing and related facilities for persons and families of low or moderate income or elderly or handicapped persons or families and loans under section 1490f of this title to provide condominium housing for persons and families of low or moderate income, shall bear interest at a rate prescribed by the Secretary at not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury upon the request of the Secretary taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. Any loan guaranteed under this subchapter shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the lender.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) From the interest rate so determined, the Secretary may provide the borrower with assistance in the form of credits so as to reduce the effective interest rate to a rate not less than 1 per centum per annum for such periods of time as the Secretary may determine for applicants described in subparagraph (A) if without such assistance such applicants could not afford the dwelling or make payments on the indebtedness of the rental or cooperative housing. In the case of assistance provided under this subparagraph with respect to a loan under section 1472 of this <!-- PDFPage:2640 -->title, the Secretary may not reduce, cancel, or refuse to renew the assistance due to an increase in the adjusted income of the borrower if the reduction, cancellation, or nonrenewal will cause the borrower to be unable to reasonably afford the resulting payments required under the loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For persons of low income under section 1472 or 1487(a) of this title who the Secretary determines are unable to afford a dwelling with the assistance provided under subparagraph (B) and when the Secretary determines that assisted rental housing programs (as authorized under this subchapter, the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], and the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.]) would be unsuitable in the area in which such persons reside, the Secretary may provide additional assistance, pursuant to amounts approved in appropriation Acts and for such periods of time as the Secretary may determine, which may be in an amount not to exceed the difference between (i) the amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to pay the principal indebtedness, interest, taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance, and (ii) 25 per centum of the income of such applicant. The amount of such additional assistance which may be approved in appropriation Acts may not exceed an aggregate amount of $100,000,000. Such additional assistance may not be so approved with respect to any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) With respect to borrowers under section 1472 or 1487(a) of this title who have received assistance under subparagraph (B) or (C), the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of all or a portion of such assistance rendered upon the disposition or nonoccupancy of the property by the borrower. In providing for such recapture, the Secretary shall make provisions to provide incentives for the borrower to maintain the property in a marketable condition. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance whenever rendered shall constitute a debt secured by the security instruments given by the borrower to the Secretary to the extent that the Secretary may provide for recapture of such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In determining the amount recaptured under this subparagraph with respect to any loan made pursuant to section 1472(a)(3) of this title for the purchase of a dwelling located on land owned by a community land trust, the Secretary shall determine any appreciation of the dwelling based on any agreement between the borrower and the community land trust that limits the sale price or appreciation of the dwelling.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Except for Federal or State laws relating to taxation, the assistance rendered to any borrower under subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall not be considered to be income or resources for any purpose under any Federal or State laws including, but not limited to, laws relating to welfare and public assistance programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Loans subject to the interest rates and assistance provided under this paragraph (1) may be made only when the Secretary determines the needs of the applicant for necessary housing cannot be met with financial assistance from other sources including assistance under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] and the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall make and insure loans under this section and sections 1484, 1485, and 1487 of this title to provide rental or cooperative housing and related facilities for persons and families of low income in multifamily housing projects, and shall make, and contract to make, assistance payments to the owners of such rental, congregate, or cooperative housing in order to make available to low-income occupants of such housing rentals at rates commensurate to income and not exceeding the highest of (i) 30 per centum of monthly adjusted income, (ii) 10 per centum of monthly income, or (iii) if the person or family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's or family's housing costs. Any rent or contribution of any recipient shall not increase as a result of this section or any other provision of Federal law or regulation by more than 10 per centum during any twelve-month period, unless the increase above 10 per centum is attributable to increases in income which are unrelated to this subsection or other law or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The owner of any project assisted under this paragraph shall be required to provide at least annually a budget of operating expenses and record of tenants&rsquo; income which shall be used to determine the amount of assistance for each project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The project owner shall accumulate, safeguard, and periodically pay to the Secretary any rental charges collected in excess of basic rental charges as established by the Secretary in conformity with subparagraph (A). These funds may be credited to the appropriation and used by the Secretary for making such assistance payments through the end of the next fiscal year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, excess funds received from tenants in projects financed under section 1485 of this title during a fiscal year shall be available during the next succeeding fiscal year, together with funds provided under subparagraph (D), to the extent approved in appropriations Acts, to make assistance payments to reduce rent overburden on behalf of tenants of any such project whose rents exceed the levels referred to in subparagraph (A).

<p class="statutory-body">(E) In order to assist elderly or handicapped persons or families who elect to live in a shared housing arrangement in which they benefit as a result of sharing the facilities of a dwelling with <!-- PDFPage:2641 -->others in a manner that effectively and efficiently meets their housing needs and thereby reduces their cost of housing, the Secretary shall permit rental assistance to be used by such persons or families if the shared housing arrangement is in a single-family dwelling. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall prescribe minimum habitability standards to assure decent, safe, and sanitary housing for such families while taking into account the special circumstances of shared housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of loans under sections 1484 and 1485 of this title approved prior to the effective date of this paragraph with respect to which rental assistance is provided, the rent for tenants receiving such assistance shall not exceed the highest of (i) 30 per centum of monthly adjusted income, (ii) 10 per centum of monthly income, or (iii) if the person or family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's or family's housing costs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) No rent for a unit financed under section 1484 or 1485 of this title shall be increased as a result of this subsection or other provision of Federal law or Federal regulation by more than 10 per centum in any twelve-month period, unless the increase above 10 per centum is attributable to increases in income which are unrelated to this subsection or other law, or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of a loan with respect to the purchase of a manufactured home with respect to which rental assistance is provided, the monthly payment for principal and interest on the manufactured home and for lot rental and utilities shall not exceed the highest of (A) 30 per centum of monthly adjusted income, (B) 10 per centum of monthly income, or (C) if the person or family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's or family's housing costs.</p>

There are authorized to be appropriated to the Rural Housing Insurance Fund such sums as may be necessary to reimburse such fund for the amount of assistance payments described in subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section. The Secretary may from time to time issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury under section 1487(h) and of this title and section 1490f of this title to obtain amounts equal to such unreimbursed payments, pending the annual reimbursement by appropriation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any such authority remaining after carrying out subparagraphs (A) and (B) may be used to provide further assistance to existing projects under section 1484, 1485, or 1486 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall transfer rental assistance contract authority under this section from projects where such authority is unused after initial rentup and not needed because of a lack of eligible tenants in the area to projects where such authority is needed.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; financial and technical assistance; selection of training sites and location of housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the application of any State or political subdivision thereof, or any public or private nonprofit organization, the Secretary is authorized, after consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, and after the Secretary determines that the housing and related facilities cannot reasonably be provided in any other way, to provide financial and technical assistance for the establishment, in rural areas, of housing and related facilities for trainees and their families who are residents of a rural area and have a rural background, while such trainees are enrolled and participating in training courses designed to improve their employment capability. The selection of training sites and location of housing shall be made with due regard to the economic viability of the area, and only after consideration of a labor area survey and full coordination among all Government agencies having primary responsibility for administering related programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Quality of housing and related facilities; design and location</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Housing and related facilities assisted under this section shall be safe and sanitary, constructed in the most economical manner, and of modest design, giving due consideration to the purposes to be served and the needs of the occupants, and may, in the discretion of the Secretary, include mobile family quarters. Design and location shall be such as to facilitate, as feasible, the use of such housing and related facilities for other purposes when no longer needed for the primary purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contribution of land by applicant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The applicant shall contribute the necessary land, or funds to acquire such land, from its own resources, including land acquired by donation or from funds repayable under subsection (e) of this section or borrowed from other sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conditions precedent to grant of financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No financial assistance shall be made available under this section unless, to the extent and for the periods required by the Secretary, the applicant agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such housing will be maintained at all times in a safe and sanitary condition in ac<!-- PDFPage:2644 -->cordance with standards prescribed by State or local law, or, in the absence of such standards, with requirements prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) priority shall be given at all times, in granting occupancy of such housing and facilities, to the trainees and their families described in subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) rentals charged them shall not exceed amounts approved by the Secretary after considering the portion of the actual total family income which the family can afford to pay for rent while meeting its other immediate needs during occupancy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Advances; repayment; limitation on amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make advances pursuant to any contract for financial assistance under this section at such times and in such manner as may be specified in the contract. Such advances for the purchase of land shall be repayable with interest and within a period not to exceed thirty-three years and may be made upon such security, if any, as the Secretary requires. Advances for other purposes may be made repayable with or without interest or nonrepayable, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the anticipated income, and cost of operation of the housing and related facilities and the ability of each applicant to finance such facilities. Any advances shall be limited to cover the capital costs of constructing such facilities, plus interest on borrowings to cover such costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Sale of housing and related facilities to ineligible transferee or diversion to use other than primary purpose; repayment of advances; return of property to original condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Should housing and related facilities assisted pursuant to a contract under this section be sold to an ineligible transferee or diverted to a use other than its primary purpose within a period specified in the contract, all advances made under such contract shall be repaid to the Secretary, up to the amount of the sales price or the fair value of the property as determined by the Secretary, whichever is higher, with interest from the date of the sale or diversion. If no suitable alternate use of the property is available, as determined by the Secretary, after the purpose of this section can no longer be served, the property shall be returned to its original condition by the recipient of the assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Interest on advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest charged on advances made under this section shall be at a rate, prescribed by the Secretary, which shall be not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, less not to exceed the difference between the adjusted rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and 1 per centum per annum, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to insure that Federal funds expended under this section are not wasted or dissipated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Related facilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;trainee&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section (1) the term &ldquo;related facilities&rdquo; shall include any necessary community rooms or buildings, infirmaries, utilities, access roads, water and sewer services, and the minimum fixed or movable equipment determined by the Secretary to be necessary to make the housing reasonably habitable by trainees and their families; and (2) the term &ldquo;trainee&rdquo; means any person receiving training under any federally assisted training program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Authorization of appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may also provide assistance payments as provided by section 1437f(<em>o</em>) of this title or section 1490r of this title upon the request of grantees in order to minimize the displacement of very low-income tenants residing in units rehabilitated or replaced with assistance under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) be used to provide other comparable assistance that the Secretary deems appropriate to carry out the purpose of this section, designed to reduce the costs of such repair, rehabilitation, and replacement in order to make such housing affordable by persons of low income and, to the extent feasible, by persons <!-- PDFPage:2651 -->and families whose incomes do not exceed 50 per centum of the area median income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) benefit low- and very low-income persons and families in rural areas, without causing the displacement of current residents; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation formula; transfer of funds; maximum amounts</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) that the units repaired and rehabilitated with such assistance will be occupied, or available for occupancy, by persons of low income;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, at least on an annual basis, make such review and audits as may be necessary or appropriate to determine whether the grantee has carried out its activities in a timely manner and in accordance with the requirements of this section, the degree to which the activities assisted benefitted low income families or persons and very low-income families or persons who lacked adequate housing, and whether the grantee has a continuing capacity to carry out the activities in a timely manner.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will remain available as provided in paragraph (2), according to such binding commit<!-- PDFPage:2657 -->ments as the Secretary may require, for the period of the original term of the loan guaranteed, unless the housing is acquired by foreclosure (or instrument in lieu of foreclosure) or the Secretary waives the applicability of such requirement for the loan only after determining, based on objective information, that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) housing opportunities for low-income households and minorities will not be reduced as a result of the waiver; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligibility list and annual audit</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Loan terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each loan guaranteed pursuant to this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide for complete amortization by periodic payments to be made for a term not to exceed 40 years;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) for at least 20 percent of the loans made under this section, the Secretary shall provide the borrower with assistance in the form of credits pursuant to section 1490a(a)(1)(B) of this title to the extent necessary to reduce the rate of interest under paragraph (2) to the applicable Federal rate, as such term is used in section 42(i)(2)(D) of title 26.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Guarantee fee</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authority for lenders to issue certificates of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may authorize certain eligible lenders to determine whether a loan meets the requirements for guarantee under this section and, subject to the availability of authority to enter into guarantees under this section, execute a firm commitment for a guarantee binding upon the Secretary and issue a certificate of guarantee evidencing a guarantee, without review and approval by the Secretary of the specific loan. The Secretary may establish standards for approving eligible lenders for a delegation of authority under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Payment under guarantee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice of default</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After receiving notice under paragraph (1) and providing written notice of action under this paragraph to the Secretary, the holder of the guarantee certificate for the loan may initiate foreclosure proceedings for the loan in a court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, to obtain possession of the security property. After the court issues a final order authorizing foreclosure on the property, the holder of the certificate shall be entitled to payment by the Secretary under the guarantee (in the amount provided under subsection (b) of this section) upon (A) conveyance to the Secretary of title to the security property, (B) submission to the Secretary of a claim for payment under the guarantee, and (C) assignment to the Secretary of all the claims of the holder of the guarantee against the borrower or others arising out of the loan transaction or foreclosure <!-- PDFPage:2658 -->proceedings, except claims released with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assignment by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After receiving notice under paragraph (1), the Secretary may accept assignment of the loan if the Secretary determines that the assignment is in the best interests of the United States. Assignment of a loan under this paragraph shall include conveyance to the Secretary of title to the security property, assignment to the Secretary of all rights and interests arising under the loan, and assignment to the Secretary of all claims against the borrower or others arising out of the loan transaction. Upon assignment of a loan under this paragraph, the holder of a guarantee certificate for the loan shall be entitled to payment by the Secretary under the guarantee (in the amount provided under subsection (b) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before any payment under a guarantee is made under paragraph (2) or (3), the holder of the guarantee certificate shall exhaust all reasonable possibilities of collection on the loan guaranteed. Upon payment, in whole or in part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States. The Secretary shall then take such action to collect as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Violation of guarantee requirements by lenders issuing guarantees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Indemnification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a loan guaranteed by an eligible lender pursuant to delegation of authority under subsection (h) of this section was not originated in accordance with the requirements under this section and the Secretary pays a claim under the guarantee for the loan, the Secretary may require the eligible lender authorized under subsection (h) of this section to issue the guarantee certificate for the loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to indemnify the Secretary for the loss, if the payment under the guarantee was made within a reasonable period specified by the Secretary; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to indemnify the Secretary for the loss regardless of when payment under the guarantee was made, if the Secretary determines that fraud or misrepresentation was involved in connection with the origination of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination of authority to issue guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may cancel a delegation of authority under subsection (h) of this section to an eligible lender if the Secretary determines that the lender has violated the requirements and procedures for guaranteed loans under this section or for other good cause. Any such cancellation shall be made by giving notice to the eligible lender and shall take effect upon receipt of the notice by the mortgagee or at a later date, as the Secretary may provide. A decision by the Secretary to cancel a delegation shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Refinancing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any loan guaranteed under this section may be refinanced and extended in accordance with terms and conditions that the Secretary shall prescribe, but in no event for an additional amount or term that exceeds the limitations under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Nonassumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The borrower under a loan that is guaranteed under this section and under which any portion of the principal obligation or interest remains outstanding may not be relieved of liability with respect to the loan, notwithstanding the transfer of property for which the loan was made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Geographical targeting</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide for an independent entity to conduct a study to determine the extent to which borrowers in the United States will utilize loan guarantees under this section, the rural areas in the United States in which borrowers can best utilize and most need loans guaranteed under this section, and the rural areas in the United States in which housing of the type eligible for a loan guarantee under this section is most needed by low- and moderate-income families. The Secretary shall require the independent entity conducting the study to submit a report to the Secretary and to the Congress describing the results of the study not later than the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on March 28, 1996.</p>

Such standards shall include standards for fair housing and equal opportunity, lease and grievance procedures, and tenant appeals of adverse actions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Housing standards</h4>
