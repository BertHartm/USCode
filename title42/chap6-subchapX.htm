<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides comprehensive medical care to victims of trauma in the geographic area in which the trauma center is located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is established by the State or political subdivision in which such center is located; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the trauma center involved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) submits to the Secretary a plan satisfactory to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) made by a trauma center that, for the purpose specified in such section, will receive financial assistance from the State or political subdivision involved for each fiscal year during which payments are made to the center from the grant, which financial assistance is exclusive of any assistance provided by the State or political subdivision as a non-Federal contribution under any Federal program requiring such a contribution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) made by a trauma center that, with respect to the system described in section 300d&ndash;41(b)(2) of this title in which the center is a participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is providing trauma care in a geographic area in which the availability of trauma care has significantly decreased as a result of a trauma center in the area permanently ceasing participation in such system as of a date occurring during the 2-year period specified in section 300d&ndash;41(b)(1)(B) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will, in providing trauma care during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the application for the grant is submitted, incur uncompensated costs in an amount rendering the center unable to continue participation in such system, resulting in a significant decrease in the availability of trauma care in the geographic area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further preference for certain applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to applications for grants under section 300d&ndash;41 of this title that are receiving preference for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall give further preference to any such application made by a trauma center for which a disproportionate percentage of the uncompensated costs of the center result from the provision of trauma care to individuals who neither are citizens nor aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.</p>
