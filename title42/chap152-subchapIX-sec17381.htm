<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States to support the modernization of the Nation's electricity transmission and distribution system to maintain a reliable and secure electricity infrastructure that can meet future demand growth and to achieve each of the following, which together characterize a Smart Grid:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Increased use of digital information and controls technology to improve reliability, security, and efficiency of the electric grid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Dynamic optimization of grid operations and resources, with full cyber-security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Deployment and integration of distributed resources and generation, including renewable resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Development and incorporation of demand response, demand-side resources, and energy-efficiency resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Deployment of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; technologies (real-time, automated, interactive technologies that optimize the physical operation of appliances and consumer devices) for metering, communications concerning grid operations and status, and distribution automation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Integration of &ldquo;smart&rdquo; appliances and consumer devices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Deployment and integration of advanced electricity storage and peak-shaving technologies, including plug-in electric and hybrid electric vehicles, and thermal-storage air conditioning.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Provision to consumers of timely information and control options.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Development of standards for communication and interoperability of appliances and equipment connected to the electric grid, including the infrastructure serving the grid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Identification and lowering of unreasonable or unnecessary barriers to adoption of smart grid technologies, practices, and services.</p>
