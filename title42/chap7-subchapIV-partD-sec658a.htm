<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to any other payment under this part, the Secretary shall, subject to subsection (f) of this section, make an incentive payment to each State for each fiscal year in an amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of incentive payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The incentive payment for a State for a fiscal year is equal to the incentive payment pool for the fiscal year, multiplied by the State incentive payment share for the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Incentive payment pool</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;incentive payment pool&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ix) $483,000,000 for fiscal year 2008; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(x) for any succeeding fiscal year, the amount of the incentive payment pool for the fiscal year that precedes such succeeding fiscal year, multiplied by the percentage (if any) by which the CPI for such preceding fiscal year exceeds the CPI for the second preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) CPI</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the CPI for a fiscal year is the average of the Consumer Price Index for the 12-month period ending on September 30 of the fiscal year. As used in the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;Consumer Price Index&rdquo; means the last Consumer Price Index for all-urban consumers published by the Department of Labor.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Incentive base amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In paragraph (3), the term &ldquo;incentive base amount&rdquo; means, with respect to a State and a fiscal year, the sum of the applicable percentages (determined in accordance with paragraph (6)) multiplied by the corresponding maximum incentive base amounts for the State for the fiscal year, with respect to each of the following measures of State performance for the fiscal year:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The paternity establishment performance level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The support order performance level.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with respect to the performance measures described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (4), the State collections base for the fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to the performance measures described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of paragraph (4), 75 percent of the State collections base for the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Data required to be complete and reliable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), the maximum incentive base amount for a State for a fiscal year with respect to a performance measure described in paragraph (4) is zero, unless the Secretary determines, on the basis of an audit performed under section 652(a)(4)(C)(i) of this title, that the data which the State submitted pursuant to section 654(15)(B) of this title for the fiscal year and which is used to determine the performance level involved is complete and reliable.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) State collections base</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the State collections base for a fiscal year is equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 2 times the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the total amount of support collected during the fiscal year under the <!-- PDFPage:1891 -->State plan approved under this part in cases in which the support obligation involved is required to be assigned to the State pursuant to part A or E of this subchapter or subchapter XIX of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the total amount of support collected during the fiscal year under the State plan approved under this part in cases in which the support obligation involved was so assigned but, at the time of collection, is not required to be so assigned; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total amount of support collected during the fiscal year under the State plan approved under this part in all other cases.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Paternity establishment</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Determination of paternity establishment performance level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The paternity establishment performance level for a State for a fiscal year is, at the option of the State, the IV&ndash;D paternity establishment percentage determined under section 652(g)(2)(A) of this title or the statewide paternity establishment percentage determined under section 652(g)(2)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Determination of applicable percentage</h4>
