Such assistance shall include project planning and feasibility studies, management and operational assistance, and studies evaluating the needs of, and developing potentialities for, economic growth of such areas. Such assistance may be provided by the Secretary through members of his staff, through the payment of funds authorized for this section to other departments or agencies of the Federal Government, through the employment of private individuals, partnerships, firms, corporations, or suitable institutions, under contracts entered into for such purposes, or through grants-in-aid to appropriate public or private nonprofit State, area, district, or local organizations.

In determining the amount of the non-Federal share of such costs or expenses, the Secretary shall give due consideration to all contributions both in cash and in kind, fairly evaluated, including but not limited to space, equipment, and services. Where practicable, grants-in-aid authorized under this subsection shall be used in conjunction with other available planning grants, such as urban planning grants authorized under the <!-- PDFPage:3161 -->Housing Act of 1954, as amended, and highway planning and research grants authorized under the Federal Aid Highway Act of 1962, to assure adequate and effective planning and economical use of funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Research in causes of chronic depression; availability of resulting data; annual report</h4>

The program of study, training, and research may be conducted by the Secretary through members of this staff, through payment of funds authorized for this section to other departments or agencies of the Federal Government, or through the employment of private individuals, partnerships, firms, corporations, or suitable institutions, under contracts entered into for such purposes, or through grants to such individuals, organizations, or institutions, or through conferences and similar meetings organized for such purposes. The Secretary shall make available to interested individuals and organizations the results of such research.

The Secretary may furnish the procurement divisions of the various departments, agencies, and other instrumentalities of the Federal Government with a list containing the names and addresses of business firms which are located in redevelopment areas and which are desirous of obtaining Government contracts for the furnishing of supplies or services, and designating the supplies and services such firms are engaged in providing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Independent study board; membership; findings and report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish an independent study board consisting of governmental and nongovernmental experts to investigate the effects of Government procurement, scientific, technical, and other related policies, upon regional economic development. Any Federal officer or employee may, with the consent of the head of the department or agency in which he is employed, serve as a member of such board, but shall receive no additional compensation for such service. Other members of such board may be compensated in accordance with the provisions of section 3211(10) of this title.
