<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The extension of the human presence from low-Earth orbit to other regions of space beyond low-Earth orbit will enable missions to the surface of the Moon and missions to deep space destinations such as near-Earth asteroids and Mars.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The regions of cis-lunar space are accessible to other national and commercial launch capabilities, and such access raises a host of national security concerns and economic implications that international human space endeavors can help to address.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The ability to support human missions in regions beyond low-Earth orbit and on the surface of the Moon can also drive developments in emerging areas of space infrastructure and technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Developments in space infrastructure and technology can stimulate and enable increased space applications, such as in-space servicing, propellant resupply and transfer, and in situ resource utilization, and open opportunities for additional users of space, whether national, commercial, or international.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A long term objective for human exploration of space should be the eventual international exploration of Mars.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Future international missions beyond low-Earth orbit should be designed to incorporate capability development and availability, affordability, and international contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Human space flight and future exploration beyond low-Earth orbit should be based around a pay-as-you-go approach. Requirements in new launch and crew systems authorized in this chapter should be scaled to the minimum necessary to meet the core national mission capability needed to conduct cis-lunar missions. These initial missions, along with the development of new technologies and in-space capabilities can form the foundation for missions to other destinations. These initial missions also should provide operational experience prior to the further human expansion into space.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report on international collaboration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Report required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 120 days after October 11, 2010, the Administrator shall submit to the appro<!-- PDFPage:8168 -->priate committees of Congress a report on the following assets and capabilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Any effort by NASA to expand and ensure effective international collaboration on the ISS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The efforts of NASA, including its approach and progress, in defining near-term, cis-lunar space human missions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) NASA contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In preparing the report required by paragraph (1), the Administrator shall assume that NASA will contribute to the efforts described in that paragraph the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A Space Launch System.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A multi-purpose crew vehicle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Such other technology elements the Administrator may consider appropriate, and which the Administrator shall specifically identify in the report.</p>
