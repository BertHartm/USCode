<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The formula established in paragraph (1) of section 300x&ndash;7(a) of this title shall apply to this subsection to the same extent and in the same manner as the formula applies for purposes of section 300x&ndash;7(a) of this title, except that, in the application of such formula for purposes of this subsection, the modifications described in subparagraph (B) shall apply.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Availability of data on population</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to data on the civilian population of the territories of the United States, if the Secretary determines for a fiscal year that recent such data for purposes of paragraph (1)(B) do not exist regarding a territory, the Secretary shall for such purposes estimate the civilian population of the territory by modifying the data on the territory to reflect the average extent of change occurring during the ensuing period in the population of all territories with respect to which recent such data do exist.</p>
