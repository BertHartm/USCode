<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Health maintenance organization&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;health maintenance organization&rdquo; means a public or private entity which is organized under the laws of any State and which (1) provides basic and supplemental health services to its members in the manner prescribed by subsection (b) of this section, and (2) is organized and operated in the manner prescribed by subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Manner of supplying basic and supplemental health services to members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A health maintenance organization shall provide, without limitations as to time or cost other than those prescribed by or under this subchapter, basic and supplemental health services to its members in the following manner:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Each member is to be provided basic health services for a basic health services payment which (A) is to be paid on a periodic basis without regard to the dates health services (within the basic health services) are provided; (B) is fixed without regard to the frequency, extent, or kind of health service (within the basic health services) actually furnished; (C) except in the case of basic health services provided a member who is a full-time student (as defined by the Secretary) at an accredited institution of higher education, is fixed under a community rating system; and (D) may be supplemented by additional nominal payments which may be required for the provision of specific services (within the basic health services), except that such payments may not be required where or in such a manner that they serve (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) as a barrier to the delivery of health services. Such additional nominal payments shall be fixed in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary. If a health maintenance organization offers to its members the opportunity to obtain basic health services through a physician not described in subsection (b)(3)(A) of this section, the organization may require, in addition to payments described in clause (D) of this paragraph, a reasonable deductible to be paid by a member when obtaining a basic health service from such a physician. A health maintenance organization may include a health service, defined as a supplemental health service by section 300e&ndash;1(2) of this title, in the basic health services provided its members for a basic health services payment described in the first sentence. In the case of an entity which before it became a qualified health maintenance organization (within the meaning of section 300e&ndash;9(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300e_1_target" name="300e_1">1</a></sup> of this title) provided comprehensive health services on a prepaid basis, the requirement of clause (C) shall not apply to such entity until the expiration of the forty-eight month period beginning with the month following the month in which the entity became such a qualified health organization. The requirements of this paragraph respecting the basic health services payment shall not apply to the provision of basic health services to a member for an illness or injury for which the member is entitled to benefits under a workmen's compensation law or an insurance policy but only to the extent such benefits apply to such services. For the provision of such services for an illness or injury for which a member is entitled to benefits under such a law, the health maintenance organization may, if authorized by such law, charge or authorize the provider of such services to charge, in accordance with the charges allowed under such law, the insurance carrier, employer, or <!-- PDFPage:599 -->other entity which under such law is to pay for the provision of such services or, to the extent that such member has been paid under such law for such services, such member. For the provision of such services for an illness or injury for which a member is entitled to benefits under an insurance policy, a health maintenance organization may charge or authorize the provider of such services to charge the insurance carrier under such policy or, to the extent that such member has been paid under such policy for such services, such member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For such payment or payments (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as &ldquo;supplemental health services payments&rdquo;) as the health maintenance organization may require in addition to the basic health services payment, the organization may provide to each of its members any of the health services which are included in supplemental health services (as defined in section 300e&ndash;1(2) of this title). Supplemental health services payments which are fixed on a prepayment basis shall be fixed under a community rating system unless the supplemental health services payment is for a supplemental health service provided a member who is a full-time student (as defined by the Secretary) at an accredited institution of higher education, except that, in the case of an entity which before it became a qualified health maintenance organization (within the meaning of section 300e&ndash;9(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300e_1_target" name="300e_1">1</a></sup> of this title) provided comprehensive health services on a prepaid basis, the requirement of this sentence shall not apply to such entity during the forty-eight month period beginning with the month following the month in which the entity became such a qualified health maintenance organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), at least 90 percent of the services of a physician which are provided as basic health services shall be provided through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) members of the staff of the health maintenance organization,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a medical group (or groups),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) an individual practice association (or associations),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) physicians or other health professionals who have contracted with the health maintenance organization for the provision of such services, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) any combination of such staff, medical group (or groups), individual practice association (or associations) or physicians or other health professionals under contract with the organization.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subparagraph (A) does not apply to the provision of the services of a physician&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) which the health maintenance organization determines, in conformity with regulations of the Secretary, are unusual or infrequently used, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) which are provided a member of the organization in a manner other than that prescribed by subparagraph (A) because of an emergency which made it medically necessary that the service be provided to the member before it could be provided in a manner prescribed by subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Contracts between a health maintenance organization and health professionals for the provision of basic and supplemental health services shall include such provisions as the Secretary may require, but only to the extent that such requirements are designed to insure the delivery of quality health care services and sound fiscal management.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For purposes of this paragraph the term &ldquo;health professional&rdquo; means physicians, dentists, nurses, podiatrists, optometrists, and such other individuals engaged in the delivery of health services as the Secretary may by regulation designate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Basic health services (and only such supplemental health services as members have contracted for) shall within the area served by the health maintenance organization be available and accessible to each of its members with reasonable promptness and in a manner which assures continuity, and when medically necessary be available and accessible twenty-four hours a day and seven days a week, except that a health maintenance organization which has a service area located wholly in a nonmetropolitan area may make a basic health service available outside its service area if that basic health service is not a primary care or emergency health care service and if there is an insufficient number of providers of that basic health service within the service area who will provide such service to members of the health maintenance organization. A member of a health maintenance organization shall be reimbursed by the organization for his expenses in securing basic and supplemental health services other than through the organization if the services were medically necessary and immediately required because of an unforeseen illness, injury, or condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To the extent that a natural disaster, war, riot, civil insurrection, or any other similar event not within the control of a health maintenance organization (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) results in the facilities, personnel, or financial resources of a health maintenance organization not being available to provide or arrange for the provision of a basic or supplemental health service in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1) through (4) of this subsection, such requirements only require the organization to make a good-faith effort to provide or arrange for the provision of such service within such limitation on its facilities, personnel, or resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) A health maintenance organization that otherwise meets the requirements of this subchapter may offer a high-deductible health plan (as defined in section 220(c)(2) of title 26).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Organizational requirements</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such term does not include a health service which the Secretary, upon application of a health maintenance organization, determines is unusual and infrequently provided and not necessary for the protection of individual health. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register each determination made by him under the preceding sentence. If a service of a physician described in the preceding sentence may also be provided under applicable State law by a dentist, optometrist, podiatrist, psychologist, or other health care personnel, a health maintenance organization may provide such service through a dentist, optometrist, podiatrist, psychologist, or other health care personnel (as the case may be) licensed to provide such service.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a majority of the members of which are licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the members of which (i) as their principal professional activity engage in the coordinated practice of their profession and as a group responsibility have substantial responsibility for the delivery of health services to members of a health maintenance organization, except that this clause does not apply before the end of the forty-eight month period beginning after the month in which the health maintenance oranization&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300e-1_1_target" name="300e-1_1">1</a></sup> becomes a qualified health maintenance organization as defined in section 300e&ndash;9(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300e-1_2_target" name="300e-1_2">2</a></sup> of this title, or as authorized by the Secretary in accordance with regulations that take into consideration the unusual circumstances of the group; (ii) pool their income from practice as members of the group and distribute it among themselves according to a prearranged salary or drawing account or other similar plan unrelated to the provision <!-- PDFPage:604 -->of specific health services; (iii) share medical and other records and substantial portions of major equipment and of professional, technical, and administrative staff; (iv) arrange for and encourage continuing education in the field of clinical medicine and related areas for the members of the group; and (v) establish an arrangement whereby a member's enrollment status is not known to the health professional who provides health services to the member.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The term &ldquo;individual practice association&rdquo; means a partnership, corporation, association, or other legal entity which has entered into a services arrangement (or arrangements) with persons who are licensed to practice medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, podiatry, optometry, psychology, or other health profession in a State and a majority of whom are licensed to practice medicine or osteopathy. Such an arrangement shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that such persons shall provide their professional services in accordance with a compensation arrangement established by the entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to the extent feasible, for the sharing by such persons of medical and other records, equipment, and professional, technical, and administrative staff.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The term &ldquo;health systems agency&rdquo; means an entity which is designated in accordance with section 300<em>l</em>&ndash;4 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A system of fixing rates of payment for health services may provide that the rates shall be fixed on a per-person or per-family basis and may authorize the rates to vary with the number of persons in a family, but, except as authorized in subparagraph (D), such rates must be equivalent for all individuals and for all families of similar composition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A system of fixing rates of payment for health services may provide that the rates shall be fixed for individuals and families by groups. Except as authorized in subparagraph (D), such rates must be equivalent for all individuals in the same group and for all families of similar composition in the same group. If a health maintenance organization is to fix rates of payment for individuals and families by groups, it shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i)(I) classify all of the members of the organization into classes based on factors which the health maintenance organization determines predict the differences in the use of health services by the individuals or families in each class and which have not been disapproved by the Secretary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) determine its revenue requirements for providing services to the members of each class established under subclause (I), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) fix the rates of payments for the individuals and families of a group on the basis of a composite of the organization's revenue requirements determined under subclause (II) for providing services to them as members of the classes established under subclause (I), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) fix the rates of payments for the individuals and families of a group on the basis of the organization's revenue requirements for providing services to the group, except that the rates of payments for the individuals and families of a group of less than 100 persons may not be fixed at rates greater than 110 percent of the rate that would be fixed for such individuals and families under subparagraph (B) or clause (i) of this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall review the factors used by each health maintenance organization to establish classes under clause (i). If the Secretary determines that any such factor may not reasonably be used to predict the use of the health services by individuals and families, the Secretary shall disapprove such factor for such purpose. If a health maintenance organization is to fix rates of payment for a group under clause (ii), it shall, upon request of the entity with which it contracts to provide services to such group, disclose to that entity the method and data used in calculating the rates of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The following differentials in rates of payments may be established under the systems described in subparagraphs (B) and (C):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Nominal differentials in such rates may be established to reflect differences in marketing costs and the different administrative costs of collecting payments from the following categories of members:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Individual members (including their families).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) Small groups of members (as determined under regulations of the Secretary).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) Large groups of members (as determined under regulations of the Secretary).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Nominal differentials in such rates may be established to reflect the compositing of the rates of payment in a systematic manner to accommodate group purchasing practices of the various employers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Differentials in such rates may be established for members enrolled in a health maintenance organization pursuant to a contract with a governmental authority under section 1079 or 1086 of title 10 or under any other governmental program (other than the health benefits program authorized by chapter 89 of <!-- PDFPage:605 -->title 5) or any health benefits program for employees of States, political subdivision of States, and other public entities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(9) The term &ldquo;non-metropolitan area&rdquo; means an area no part of which is within an area designated as a standard metropolitan statistical area by the Office of Management and Budget and which does not contain a city whose population exceeds fifty thousand individuals.</p>
