<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to State and public water system; issuance of administrative order; civil action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Whenever the Administrator finds during a period during which a State has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems (within the meaning of section 300g&ndash;2(a) of this title) that any public water system&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for which a variance under section 300g&ndash;4 or an exemption under section 300g&ndash;5 of this title is not in effect, does not comply with any national primary drinking water regulation in effect under section 300g&ndash;1 of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for which a variance under section 300g&ndash;4 or an exemption under section 300g&ndash;5 of this title is in effect, does not comply with any schedule or other requirement imposed pursuant thereto,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">he shall so notify the State and such public water system and provide such advice and technical assistance to such State and public water system as may be appropriate to bring the system into compliance with such regulation or requirement by the earliest feasible time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, beyond the thirtieth day after the Administrator's notification under subparagraph (A), the State has not commenced appropriate enforcement action, the Administrator shall issue an order under subsection (g) of this section requiring the public water system to comply with such regulation or requirement or the Administrator shall commence a civil action under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever, on the basis of information available to him, the Administrator finds during a period during which a State does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems that a public water system in such State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for which a variance under section 300g&ndash;4(a)(2) or an exemption under section 300g&ndash;5(f) of this title is not in effect, does not comply with any national primary drinking water regulation in effect under section 300g&ndash;1 of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for which a variance under section 300g&ndash;4(a)(2) or an exemption under section 300g&ndash;5(f) of this title is in effect, does not comply with any schedule or other requirement imposed pursuant thereto,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Administrator shall issue an order under subsection (g) of this section requiring the public water system to comply with such regulation or requirement or the Administrator shall commence a civil action under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial determinations in appropriate Federal district courts; civil penalties, separate violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may bring a civil action in the appropriate United States district court to require compliance with a national primary drinking water regulation with an order issued under subsection (g) of this section, or with any schedule or other requirement imposed pursuant to a variance or exemption granted under section 300g&ndash;4 or 300g&ndash;5 of this title if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) authorized under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if requested by (A) the chief executive officer of the State in which is located the public water system which is not in compliance with such regulation or requirement, or (B) the agency of such State which has jurisdiction over compliance by public water systems in the State with national primary drinking water regulations or State drinking water regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The court may enter, in an action brought under this subsection, such judgement as protection of public health may require, taking into consideration the time necessary to comply and the availability of alternative water supplies; and, if the court determines that there has been a violation of the regulation or schedule or other requirement with respect to which the action was brought, the court may, taking into account the seriousness of the violation, the population at risk, and other appropriate factors, impose on the violator a civil penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each day in which such violation occurs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice of owner or operator of public water system to persons served; regulations for form, manner, and frequency of notice; amendment of regulations to provide different types and frequencies of notice; penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each owner or operator of a public water system shall give notice to the persons served by it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) of any failure on the part of the public water system to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) comply with an applicable maximum contaminant level or treatment technique <!-- PDFPage:629 -->requirement of, or a testing procedure prescribed by, a national primary drinking water regulation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) perform monitoring required by section 300j&ndash;4(a) of this title, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the public water system is subject to a variance granted under section 300g&ndash;4(a)(1)(A) or 300g&ndash;4(a)(2) of this title for an inability to meet a maximum contaminant level requirement or is subject to an exemption granted under section 300g&ndash;5 of this title, of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the existence of such variance or exemption, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any failure to comply with the requirements of any schedule prescribed pursuant to the variance or exemption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Administrator shall by regulation prescribe the form, manner, and frequency for giving notice under this subsection. Within 15 months after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall amend such regulations to provide for different types and frequencies of notice based on the differences between violations which are intermittent or infrequent and violations which are continuous or frequent. Such regulations shall also take into account the seriousness of any potential adverse health effects which may be involved. Notice of any violation of a maximum contaminant level or any other violation designated by the Administrator as posing a serious potential adverse health effect shall be given as soon as possible, but in no case later than 14 days after the violation. Notice of a continuous violation of a regulation other than a maximum contaminant level shall be given no less frequently than every 3 months. Notice of violations judged to be less serious shall be given no less frequently than annually. The Administrator shall specify the types of notice to be used to provide information as promptly and effectively as possible taking into account both the seriousness of any potential adverse health effects and the likelihood of reaching all affected persons. Notification of violations shall include notice by general circulation newspaper serving the area and, whenever appropriate, shall also include a press release to electronic media and individual mailings. Notice under this subsection shall provide a clear and readily understandable explanation of the violation, any potential adverse health effects, the steps that the system is taking to correct such violation, and the necessity for seeking alternative water supplies, if any, until the violation is corrected. Until such amended regulations are promulgated, the regulations in effect on June 19, 1986, shall remain in effect. The Administrator may also require the owner or operator of a public water system to give notice to the persons served by it of contaminant levels of any unregulated contaminant required to be monitored under section 300j&ndash;4(a) of this title. Any person who violates this subsection or regulations issued under this subsection shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $25,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice of noncompliance with secondary drinking water regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, on the basis of information available to him, the Administrator finds that within a reasonable time after national secondary drinking water regulations have been promulgated, one or more public water systems in a State do not comply with such secondary regulations, and that such noncompliance appears to result from a failure of such State to take reasonable action to assure that public water systems throughout such State meet such secondary regulations, he shall so notify the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State authority to adopt or enforce laws or regulations respecting drinking water regulations or public water systems unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall diminish any authority of a State or political subdivision to adopt or enforce any law or regulation respecting drinking water regulations or public water systems, but no such law or regulation shall relieve any person of any requirement otherwise applicable under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notice and public hearing; availability of recommendations transmitted to State and public water system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator makes a finding of noncompliance (described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section) with respect to a public water system in a State which has primary enforcement responsibility, the Administrator may, for the purpose of assisting that State in carrying out such responsibility and upon the petition of such State or public water system or persons served by such system, hold, after appropriate notice, public hearings for the purpose of gathering information from technical or other experts, Federal, State, or other public officials, representatives of such public water system, persons served by such system, and other interested persons on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ways in which such system can within the earliest feasible time be brought into compliance with the regulation or requirement with respect to which such finding was made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the means for the maximum feasible protection of the public health during any period in which such system is not in compliance with a national primary drinking water regulation or requirement applicable to a variance or exemption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">On the basis of such hearings the Administrator shall issue recommendations which shall be sent to such State and public water system and shall be made available to the public and communications media.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Administrative order requiring compliance; notice and hearing; civil penalty; civil actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which the Administrator is authorized to bring a civil action under this section or under section 300j&ndash;4 of this title with respect to any regulation, schedule, or other requirement, the Administrator also may issue an order to require compliance with such regulation, schedule, or other requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order issued under this subsection shall not take effect until after notice and opportunity for public hearing and, in the case of a State having primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in that State, until after the Administrator has provided the State <!-- PDFPage:630 -->with an opportunity to confer with the Administrator regarding the proposed order. A copy of any order proposed to be issued under this subsection shall be sent to the appropriate State agency of the State involved if the State has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in that State. Any order issued under this subsection shall state with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation. In any case in which an order under this subsection is issued to a corporation, a copy of such order shall be issued to appropriate corporate officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any person who violates, or fails or refuses to comply with, an order under this subsection shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Whenever any civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this paragraph does not exceed a total of $5,000, the penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Whenever any civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this paragraph exceeds $5,000, the penalty shall be assessed by a civil action brought by the Administrator in the appropriate United States district court (as determined under the provisions of title 28).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court of appeals has entered final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Attorney General shall recover the amount for which such person is liable in any appropriate district court of the United States. In any such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
