<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Competition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Making use of the existing infrastructure established in eligible States by the National Science Foundation, the Administrator shall conduct a merit grant competition among the eligible States in areas of research important to the mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. With respect to a grant application by an eligible State, the Administrator shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the application's merit and relevance to the mission of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the potential for the grant to serve as a catalyst to enhance the ability of researchers in the State to become more competitive for regular National Aeronautics and Space Administration funding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the potential for the grant to improve the environment for science, mathematics, and engineering education in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the need to assure the maximum distribution of grants among eligible States, consistent with merit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supplemental grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall endeavor, where appropriate, to supplement grants made under subsection (a) of this section with such grants for fellowships, traineeships, equipment, or instrumentation as are available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Eligible State&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;eligible State&rdquo; means a State designated by the Administrator as eligible to compete in the Foundation's Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings and Policy</h4>
<p class="note-body">Sections 301 to 303 of title III of Pub. L. 102&ndash;588 provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 301. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title [enacting this section and provisions set out as a note below] may be cited as the &lsquo;Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research on Space and Aeronautics Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 302. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the report of the Advisory Committee on the Future of the United States Space Program has provided a framework within which a consensus on the goals of the space program can be developed;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's space science and applications, aeronautical research and technology, and space research and technology programs will serve as the fulcrum for future initiatives by the United States in civil space and aviation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) colleges and universities in many States are currently not able to compete successfully for research grants awarded by the National Aeronautics <!-- PDFPage:3685 -->and Space Administration through its space science and applications, aeronautical research and technology, and space research and technology programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) balanced programs of space science and applications, aeronautical research and technology, and space research and technology should include initiatives designed to foster competitive research capacity in all geographic areas of the Nation; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) by strengthening the competitive research capacity in those geographic areas of the Nation which are not currently fully competitive, the education and training of scientists and engineers important to the future of the United States civil space and aviation programs will be fostered.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 303. POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration], in planning for national programs in space science and applications, aeronautical research, space flight, and exploration, should ensure the resilience of the space and aeronautics research infrastructure;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) a stable and balanced program of space science and applications, aeronautical research and technology, and space research and technology should include programs to assure that geographic areas of the United States that currently do not successfully participate in competitive space and aeronautical research activities are enabled to become more competitive; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) programs to improve competitive capabilities should be a part of the research and the educational activities of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Authorization of Appropriations</h4>

L. 102&ndash;588 provided that: &ldquo;In carrying out the programs listed in section 102(a) [106 Stat. 5108], the Administrator [of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration] should ensure that up to $10,000,000 from the appropriations authorized for &lsquo;Research and Development&rsquo;, for fiscal year 1993 are also used for purposes of establishing and developing an Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research on Space and Aeronautics.&rdquo;</p>
