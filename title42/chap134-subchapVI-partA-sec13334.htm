<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prepare a plan for and carry out a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application with respect to technologies for the nonfuel use of coal, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) production of coke and other carbon products derived from coal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) production of coal-derived, carbon-based chemical intermediates that are precursors of value-added chemicals and polymers;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6545 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) production of chemicals from coal-derived synthesis gas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) coal treatment processes, including methodologies such as solvent-extraction techniques that produce low ash, low sulfur, coal-based chemical feedstocks; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) waste utilization, including recovery, processing, and marketing of products derived from sulfur, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and ash from coal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Plan contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan described in subsection (a) of this section shall address and evaluate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the known and potential processes for using coal in the creation of products in the chemical, utility, fuel, and carbon-based materials industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the costs, benefits, and economic feasibility of using coal products in the chemical and materials industries, including value-added chemicals, carbon-based products, coke, and waste derived from coal;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the economics of coproduction of products from coal in conjunction with the production of electric power, thermal energy, and fuel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the economics of the refining of coal and coal byproducts to produce nonfuel products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the economics of coal utilization in comparison with other feedstocks that might be used for the same purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the steps that can be taken by the public and private sectors to bring about commercialization of technologies developed under the program recommended; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the past development, current status, and future potential of coal products and processes associated with nonfuel uses of coal.</p>
