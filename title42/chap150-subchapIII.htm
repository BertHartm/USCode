<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;George E. Brown, Jr. Near-Earth Object Survey Act&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Near-Earth objects pose a serious and credible threat to humankind, as many scientists believe that a major asteroid or comet was responsible for the mass extinction of the majority of the Earth's species, including the dinosaurs, nearly 65,000,000 years ago.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Similar objects have struck the Earth or passed through the Earth's atmosphere several times in the Earth's history and pose a similar threat in the future.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Several such near-Earth objects have only been discovered within days of the objects&rsquo; closest approach to Earth, and recent discoveries of such large objects indicate that many large near-Earth objects remain undiscovered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The efforts taken to date by NASA for detecting and characterizing the hazards of near-Earth objects are not sufficient to fully determine the threat posed by such objects to cause widespread destruction and loss of life.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section the term &ldquo;near-Earth object&rdquo; means an asteroid or comet with a perihelion distance of less than 1.3 Astronomical Units from the Sun.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Near-Earth Object Survey</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Survey program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall plan, develop, and implement a Near-Earth Object Survey program to detect, track, catalogue, and characterize the physical characteristics of near-Earth objects equal to or greater than 140 meters in diameter in order to assess the threat of such near-Earth objects to the Earth. It shall be the goal of the Survey program to achieve 90 percent completion of its near-Earth object catalogue (based on statistically predicted populations of near-Earth objects) within 15 years after December 30, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Fifth-year report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall transmit to the Congress, not later than February 28 of the fifth year after December 30, 2005, a report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A summary of all activities taken pursuant to paragraph (1) since December 30, 2005.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A summary of expenditures for all activities pursuant to paragraph (1) since December 30, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Initial report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall transmit to Congress not later than 1 year after December 30, 2005, an initial report that provides the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) An analysis of possible alternatives that NASA may employ to carry out the Survey program, including ground-based and space-based alternatives with technical descriptions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A recommended option and proposed budget to carry out the Survey program pursuant to the recommended option.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Analysis of possible alternatives that NASA could employ to divert an object on a likely collision course with Earth.</p>
