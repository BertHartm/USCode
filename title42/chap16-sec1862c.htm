<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the membership of merit review panels that assess proposals will be broadly representative of eligible institutions, including research universities and predominantly undergraduate and minority institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the institution receiving an award shall provide at least 50 percent of the cost, in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, of the repair, renovation, or replacement involved and shall provide this contribution from private or non-Federal public sources, except that the Director may accept a match of less than 50 percent, but at least 30 percent, for institutions which are not ranked among the top 100 of the institutions receiving Federal research and development funding, as documented in the latest annual report of the Foundation entitled &ldquo;Federal Support to Universities, Colleges, and Selected Nonprofit Institutions&rdquo;; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) to the extent practicable, eligible institutions of a given type will compete against similar institutions for Program awards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Comprehensive planning activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall conduct comprehensive planning activities, including surveys of research facility needs and other information-gathering activities, necessary to implement the Program and to develop the procedures called for under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the issuance of the comprehensive plan required by subsection (d) of this section, and consistent with the Program criteria set forth in section 1862b(c) of this title, the Director shall publish in the Federal Register proposed Program guidelines for public review for a comment period of 30 days.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) definitions for the terms &ldquo;institutions of higher education&rdquo;, &ldquo;private non-profit research organizations&rdquo;, &ldquo;research museums&rdquo;, &ldquo;consortia&rdquo;, &ldquo;facilities&rdquo;, &ldquo;facilities primarily devoted to research&rdquo;, &ldquo;instrumentation&rdquo;, &ldquo;equipment&rdquo;, &ldquo;repair&rdquo;, &ldquo;renovation&rdquo;, and &ldquo;replacement&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) selection criteria to be used by the Foundation in evaluating proposals from institutions and consortia thereof, including criteria for evaluating scientific merit and for evaluating the age and condition of existing research facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requirements for matching a Program award with contributions from non-Federal sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Comprehensive plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) states the estimated percentage of Program funds available for each category of eligible institutions, including predominantly undergraduate institutions and colleges and universities that historically have received little Federal research and development funding as well as research universities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) evaluates and addresses, to the maximum extent possible, a variety of factors which include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the unique circumstances and research facilities needs of research universities, undergraduate institutions, and other institutions whose enrollment includes substantial percentages of minorities underrepresented in science and engineering research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) innovative approaches in the management of the Program that address both short-term and long-term aspects of the renovation, repair, and replacement of academic research facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) programmatic approaches that recognize and support excellence, strengthen scientific and engineering research potential and, to the maximum extent possible and consistent with the purposes of this Act, assure an equitable distribution of resources with respect to institutions and geographical areas; and</p>
