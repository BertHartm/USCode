<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the former United States Advisory Board on Child Abuse suggests that domestic violence may be the single major precursor to child abuse and neglect fatalities in this country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) studies suggest that as many as 10,000,000 children witness domestic violence every year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) studies suggest that among children and teenagers, recent exposure to violence in the home was a significant factor in predicting a child's violent behavior;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a study by the Nurse-Family Partnership found that children whose parents did not participate in home visitation programs that provided coaching in parenting skills, advice and support, were almost 5 times more likely to be abused in their first 2 years of life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a child's exposure to domestic violence seems to pose the greatest independent risk for being the victim of any act of partner violence as an adult;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) children exposed to domestic violence are more likely to believe that using violence is an effective means of getting one's needs met and managing conflict in close relationships;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) children exposed to abusive parenting, harsh or erratic discipline, or domestic violence are at increased risk for juvenile crime; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in a national survey of more than 6,000 American families, 50 percent of men who frequently assaulted their wives also frequently abused their children.</p>
