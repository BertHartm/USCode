<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of a request therefor as herein prescribed, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall (subject to the provisions of this section) relinquish and transfer, without monetary consideration, to any State or political subdivision thereof, local housing authority, local public agency, nonprofit organization, or educational institution, all contractual rights (including the right to revenues and other proceeds) and all property right, title, and interest of the United States in and with respect to (1) any temporary housing located on land owned or controlled by such transferee and in which the United States has no leasehold or other property interest, and (2) housing materials which have been made available to the transferee by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to section 1572 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfer to provide housing for parents of deceased World War II servicemen</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of a request therefor as herein prescribed, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may (subject to the provisions of this section) relinquish and transfer, without monetary consideration other than that specifically required by this subsection, to any State, county, municipality, or local housing authority, or to any educational institution where the housing involved is being operated for its student veterans or where the land underlying the housing is in the ownership of two or more educational institutions, or to any other local public agency or nonprofit organization where the housing involved has been made available by the United States to such agency or organization pursuant to section 1572 of this title or where the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that the housing involved is urgently needed by parents of persons who served in the Armed forces at any time on or after September 16, 1940, and prior to July 26, 1947, or on or after June 27, 1950, and prior to such date thereafter as shall be determined by the President and died of service-connected illness or injury (in which case the preferences in subsection (d)(1) of this section shall not apply), all right, title, and interest of the United States in and with respect to any temporary housing (excluding commercial facilities which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines are suitable for separate disposal and community facilities which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines should be disposed of separately) located on land in which the United States has a property interest through ownership, lease, or otherwise, under the following conditions:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2984 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the land is owned by the United States and under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the transferee shall have purchased such land from the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development at a price substantially equal to the cost to the United States of the land (including survey, title examination, and other similar expenses incident to acquisition but excluding the cost or value of all improvements thereto by the United States other than extraordinary fill), or, if the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines the amount of such cost to be nominal or not readily ascertainable, at a price which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines to be fair and reasonable. Payment for such land shall be made in full at the time of sale or in not more than ten equal annual installments (the first of which shall be paid within one year from the date of conveyance) all of which shall be secured as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development with interest from the date of conveyance at the going Federal rate of interest at the time of conveyance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the land is owned by the United States and not under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the transferee shall have purchased such land from the Federal agency having jurisdiction thereof. The Federal agency having jurisdiction of any such land is authorized to sell and convey the same to any such transferee on the terms authorized herein except that the determinations required to be made by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be made by the agency having jurisdiction of such land.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If the United States does not own the land but has an interest therein through lease or otherwise, the transferee shall (i) where it is not the landowner, obtain the right to possession of such land for a term satisfactory to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, (ii) obtain from the landowner a release (or, if the transferee is the landowner, furnish a release) of the United States from all liability in connection therewith, including any liability for removal of structures or restoration of the land, except for any rental or use payment due at the time of transfer, and (iii) reimburse the United States for the proportionate amount of any payments made by the United States for the right to use the land and for taxes or payments in lieu of taxes for any period extending beyond the time of the transfer, and (iv) if the interest of the United States is not under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the transferee shall obtain a transfer or release of the interest of the United States from the Federal agency having jurisdiction, which transfers and releases by such Federal agencies are authorized on such terms as the head of the respective agency determines to be in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requests for relinquishment and transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The filing of a request under subsections (a), (b), (g), or (h) of this section must be made on or before June 30, 1953, unless the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, in any specific case, authorize the filing of a request subsequent to such date but on or before June 30, 1951, and, in any such case, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may extend, for a specified period not beyond December 31, 1951, the time hereinafter prescribed for complying with all conditions to the relinquishment or transfer. Such request shall be in the form of a resolution adopted by the governing body of the applicant, except that, in the case of a State, such request may be in the form of a written request from the governor, and, in the case of a local housing authority (other than the Alaska Housing Authority), or a local public agency organized specifically and solely for the purpose of slum clearance and community redevelopment, shall be accompanied by a resolution of the governing body of the municipality or county approving the request for transfer. Such request shall be accompanied by either (1) a final opinion of the chief law officer or legal counsel of the applicant to the effect that it has legal authority to make the request, to accept the transfer of and operate any property involved, and to perform its obligations under this subchapter, or (2) a preliminary opinion of such officer or counsel concerning the legal authority of the applicant with respect to the proposed relinquishment or transfer including a statement of the reasons for not furnishing the final opinion with the request and the time required to furnish such opinion. If a request has been submitted as herein provided, the applicant shall comply with all conditions to the relinquishment or transfer (including the furnishing of the final legal opinion) on or before June 30, 1953: <em>Provided</em>, That, in any case where the applicant is unable to comply with all conditions to the relinquishment or transfer because of the need for the enactment of State legislation or charter amendment, such date shall be June 30, 1952, and may be extended by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, upon request in a particular case, to December 31, 1952. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall act as promptly as practicable on any request which complies with the provisions of this section and is supported as herein required, and shall as promptly as practicable arrange for the making of any survey or the performance of other work necessary to the transfer: <em>Provided</em>, That, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may at any time, except with respect to housing for which a request has been or may be submitted under subsection (a) of this section, remove, dispose of, or retain any temporary housing, or part thereof, in accordance with any provision of subchapters II to VII of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Representations by transferee as to use of property; preferences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No relinquishment or transfer with respect to temporary housing shall be made under this section unless the transferee represents in its request therefor that it proposes, to the extent permitted by law:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) As among eligible applicants for occupancy in dwellings of given sizes and at speci<!-- PDFPage:2985 -->fied rents, to extend the following preferences in the selection of tenants:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">First, to families which are to be displaced by any low-rent housing project or by any public slum-clearance or redevelopment project initiated after January 1, 1947, or which were so displaced within three years prior to making application for admission to such housing; and as among such families first preference shall be given to families of disabled veterans whose disability has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected, and second preference shall be given to families of deceased veterans and servicemen whose death has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected, and third preference shall be given to families of other veterans and servicemen;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Second, to families of other veterans and servicemen; and as among such families first preference shall be given to families of disabled veterans whose disability has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected, and second preference shall be given to families of deceased veterans and servicemen whose death has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected: <em>Provided</em>, That if the transferee is an educational institution it may limit such preferences to student veterans and servicemen, and their families, and may, in lieu of such preferences, make available to veterans or servicemen and their families accommodations in any housing of the institution equal in number to the accommodations relinquished or transferred to it: <em>And provided further</em>, That, notwithstanding such preferences, if the transferee is a State, political subdivision, local housing authority, or local public agency, it will, in filling vacancies in housing transferred under subsection (b) of this section, give such preferences to military personnel and persons engaged in national defense or mobilization activities as the Secretary of Defense or his designee prescribes to such transferee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Not to dispose of any right, title, or interest in the property (by sale, transfer, grant, exchange, mortgage, lease, release, termination of the leasehold, or any other relinquishment of interest) either (i) for housing use on the present site or on any other site except to a State or political subdivision thereof, local housing authority, a local public agency, or an educational or eleemosynary institution, or (ii) for any other use unless the governing body of the municipality or county shall have adopted a resolution determining that, on the basis of local need and acceptability, the structures involved are satisfactory for such use and need not be removed: <em>Provided</em>, That this representation will not apply to any disposal through demolition for salvage, lease to tenants for residential occupancy, or lease of nondwelling facilities for the continuance of a use existing on the date of transfer, or where such disposal is the result of a bona fide foreclosure or other proceeding to enforce rights given as security for a loan to pay for land under this section: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as applicable to the disposition of any land or interest therein after the removal of the structures therefrom.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To manage and operate the property involved in accordance with sound business practices, including the establishment of adequate reserves.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whenever the structures involved, or a substantial portion thereof, are terminated for housing use and are not to be used for a specific nonhousing use, to promptly demolish such structures terminated for housing use and clear the site thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of removal requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any relinquishment or transfer by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under this section shall constitute a waiver of the requirements of section 1553 of this title (and any contractual obligations pursuant thereto) for removing the housing involved if the request for such relinquishment or transfer was made, as authorized herein, by the governing body of the municipality or county, or by the local housing authority, or, in other cases, if, prior to or within six months after the date of the relinquishment or transfer, there is filed with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development a resolution of such governing body specifically approving (1) the unconditional waiver of such requirements or (2) the waiver of such requirements subject to conditions specified in the resolution. Any such conditions shall not affect the waiver of removal requirements hereunder, and the United States shall assume no responsibility for compliance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Disposition of net revenue and proceeds; transfer charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any relinquishment or transfer under this section, the net revenues and other proceeds from such housing to which the United States is entitled on the basis of periodic settlements shall continue to accrue to the United States until the end of the month in which the relinquishment or transfer is made, and the obligation of the transferee to pay such accrued amounts shall not be affected by this section. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may charge to the transferee the cost to the United States of any survey, title information, or other item incidental to the transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transfers for slum clearance and community redevelopment projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of a request therefor as herein prescribed, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may (subject to the provisions of this section) relinquish and transfer, without monetary consideration other than payment for land involved as specifically required by subsection (b) of this section, to any local public agency organized specifically and solely for the purpose of slum clearance and community redevelopment in a municipality in which the total number of persons, who on December 31, 1948, were living in temporary family accommodations provided by the United States or any agency thereof since September 8, 1939, exceeded the total population of such municipality as shown <!-- PDFPage:2986 -->by the 1940 census, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and with respect to any temporary housing located in such municipality under the conditions set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall not relinquish or transfer any right, title, or interest of the United States in and with respect to any temporary housing situated in such a municipality except as set forth in this subsection if at the time of the relinquishment or transfer there is in existence in such a municipality a local public agency organized specifically and solely for the purpose of slum clearance and community redevelopment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Transfers of temporary housing of masonry construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of a request therefor as herein prescribed, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may (subject to the provisions of this section except the provisions of subsection (d) of this section) relinquish and transfer to any municipality, without monetary consideration other than payment for the land involved as specifically required by subsection (b) of this section, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and with respect to unoccupied temporary housing of masonry construction located in such municipality: <em>Provided</em>, That such housing has been wholly or partially stripped of trim and fixtures prior to April 20, 1950 and the municipality adopts a resolution determining that the structures, with proposed improvements, will be suitable for long-term housing use.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Lease, condemnation or purchase; temporary housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may continue by lease or condemnation any interest less than a fee simple in lands heretofore acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for national defense or war housing or for veterans&rsquo; housing (whether of permanent or temporary character), or held by any Federal agency in connection therewith, and may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, a fee simple title to or lesser interest in any such lands if the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that the acquisition of such fee simple or lesser interest is necessary to protect the Government's investment or to maintain the improvements constructed thereon, or that the cost of fulfilling the Government's obligation to restore the property to its original condition would equal or exceed the cost of acquiring the title thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In any city in which, on March 1, 1953, there were more than ten thousand temporary housing units held by the United States of America, or any two contiguous cities in one of which there were on such date more than ten thousand temporary housing units so held, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, a fee simple title to any or all lands in which the Secretary holds a leasehold interest, or other interest less than a fee simple, acquired by the Federal Government for national defense or war housing or for veteran's housing where (1) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development finds that the acquisition by the Secretary of a fee simple title in the land will tend to expedite the orderly disposal or removal of temporary housing under the Secretary's jurisdiction by facilitating the availability of improved sites for privately owned housing needed to replace such temporary housing, and will tend to expedite the transition of the city from a war-affected community containing, as of said date, a large number of temporary houses to a community having additional permanent, well-planned, residential neighborhoods, (2) the local governing body of the city makes a like finding and requests the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to acquire such title to the land, and (3) the city has furnished assurances satisfactory to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that no individual who is employed by, or is an official of, the government of the city in which the land is located, or any agency thereof, shall be permitted, directly or indirectly, to have any financial interest in the purchase or redevelopment of such land: <em>Provided</em>, That such acquisitions by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this sentence shall be limited to not exceeding four hundred and twenty-five acres of land in the general area in which approximately one thousand five hundred units of temporary housing held by the United States of America were unoccupied on said date: <em>And provided further</em>, That funds for such acquisition by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which are authorized, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and title II of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1955, to be expended from the revolving fund established by section 1701g&ndash;5 of title 12, shall be taken into consideration, to the extent that they are needed, in making any determination pursuant to the second proviso under that section. All or any part of any land so acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, during the five year period following the date of its acquisition, be sold by the Secretary, through negotiated sale, to such city or any local public agency where (1) the city or local public agency has represented to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that it is duly authorized under State law to purchase and resell such land, that such land will be made available to private enterprise for development in accordance with local zoning and other laws, and that the aggregate of such land and any other land in the same city previously sold under the author<!-- PDFPage:2989 -->ity of this paragraph to the city or a local public agency will be developed for predominantly residential use, and (2) the city or local public agency has agreed to pay the fair market value of the land as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, after giving consideration, among other relevant information, to the cost to the Federal Government of acquiring the fee simple title and of holding the land pending sale (including estimated amounts to cover legal and overhead expenses of such acquisition and to cover interest costs to the Federal Government of monies invested in the land pending sale). Any such negotiated sale of land to the city or a local public agency shall be made upon terms which require (1) that the city or public agency shall pay in cash at least one third of the price of the land upon its conveyance and the entire price within one year after its conveyance and (2) that any portion of the entire price not paid upon such conveyance shall be represented by an indebtedness which shall bear interest on outstanding balances at a rate of 4 per centum per annum and which shall be secured by a first mortgage lien upon the land or such portion of the land as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development deems adequate to protect the financial interest of the Federal Government. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, at any time that the Secretary deems it to be in the public interest to do so, dispose, under authority of other provisions of subchapters II to VII of this chapter, of any land acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this paragraph. Any land acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this paragraph which has not been disposed of within five years after its acquisition shall be disposed of by the Secretary as expeditiously as possible in the public interest in accordance with other authority contained in subchapters II to VII of this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1546 of this title or any other provisions of law, no payments in lieu of taxes shall be made for any tax year beginning subsequent to the date of the acquisition of title to the property by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Land rentals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development holds, on or after April 1, 1950, an interest in land acquired by the Federal Government for national defense, war housing, or veterans&rsquo; housing and where (1) the term of such interest (as prescribed in the taking or in the lease or other instruments) is for the &ldquo;duration of the emergency&rdquo; or &ldquo;duration of the war&rdquo;, or &ldquo;duration of the emergency&rdquo; or &ldquo;duration of the war&rdquo; plus a specific period thereafter, or for some similarly prescribed term, and (2) the rental, award, or other consideration which the Federal Government is obligated to pay or furnish for such interest gives the owner of the land less than an annual return, after payment of real estate taxes, of 6 per centum of the lowest value placed on such land by an independent appraiser, hired by the Government to make such appraisal based on the value of the land before the acquisition of the Government's interest therein, plus 100 per centum of such value, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, upon request of the owner of the land and, notwithstanding any existing contractual or other rights or obligations, increase the amount of future payments for such interest in order to give the owner of the land a return for the Government's use thereof not exceeding the 6 per centum annual return described in (2) of this subsection: <em>Provided</em>, That this subsection shall not affect any payment heretofore made or any future payment accepted by an obligee, nor shall this subsection limit the consideration which may be paid for the use of any land beyond the existing term of the Government's interest therein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reserve account; availability of moneys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of law unless hereafter enacted expressly in limitation hereof, moneys shall be deposited in the reserve account established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of section 1543 of this title (which account is continued subject to the limitation as to amount specified in subsection (c) of section 1543 of this title) and all moneys deposited in such reserve account shall be and remain available for any or all of the purposes specified in said subsections (a) or (b) of section 1543 of this title or in this section without regard to the time prescribed in subsection (c) of section 1543 of this title with respect to covering moneys in such account into miscellaneous receipts. Moneys in such reserve accounts shall also be available for the payment of necessary expenses (which shall be considered nonadministrative expenses) in connection with administering (1) transfers pursuant to section 1581 of this title, (2) redeterminations of the temporary or permanent character of demountable housing pursuant to section 1583 of this title, (3) changes in land tenure and revisions in the consideration payable to landowners pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, and (4) transfers of permanent war housing for low-rent use pursuant to section 1586 of this title. Moneys in such reserve account shall also be available for the purpose of making improvements to, or alterations of, any permanent housing or part thereof if (1) the dwelling structures therein are designed for occupancy by not more than four families and are to be sold separately and (2) such improvement or alteration is requested by the local governing body as a condition to the acceptance of the dedication of streets or utilities or is necessary for compliance with local law or regulation relating to the continued operation or occupancy of the housing by a purchaser.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the first sentence of this subsection, the Secretary is specifically authorized to convey any permanent war housing project to a local public housing agency if requested in writing, within sixty days after April 20, 1950, by such agency or the executive head of the municipality (or of the county or parish if such project is not in a municipality) within which the project is located, or by the Governor of the State where an agency of the State has authority to operate the project: <em>Provided</em>, That any conveyance by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this sentence shall be subject to the same conditions and requirements as provided in this section with respect to a project specifically designated herein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Projects as &ldquo;low-rent housing&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the conveyance by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of any such project pursuant to the provisions of this section, such project shall constitute and be deemed to be &ldquo;low-rent housing&rdquo; as that term is used and defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] (and to be a low-rent housing project assisted pursuant to that Act, within the meaning of section 1404a(b) of this title). Any instrument of conveyance by the Administrator stating that it is executed under subchapters II to VII of this chapter shall be conclusive evidence of compliance therewith insofar as any title or other interest in the property is concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conditions and requirements of agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agreement between the public housing agency and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development required by subsection (a) of this section shall contain the following conditions and requirements, and may contain such further <!-- PDFPage:2992 -->conditions, requirements, and provisions as the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) during a period of forty years following the conveyance the project shall be administered as low-rent housing in accordance with subsections 2(1) and 2(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1402(1) and (2)]: <em>Provided</em>, That if at any time during such period the public housing agency and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development agree that the project, or any part thereof, is no longer suitable for use as low-rent housing, the project, or part thereof, shall with the approval of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development be sold by the public housing agency after which the agreement shall be deemed to have terminated with respect to such project or part thereof except that the proceeds from such sale, after payment of the reasonable expense thereof, shall be paid to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, or, with the Secretary's approval, used to finance the repair or rehabilitation of a project or part thereof conveyed to the public housing agency under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public housing agency shall, within six months following the conveyance, initiate a program for the removal of all families residing in the project on the date of conveyance who are ineligible under the provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] for continued occupancy therein, and shall have required such ineligible tenants to vacate their dwellings within eighteen months after the initiation of such program: <em>Provided</em>, That military personnel as designated by the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall not be subject to such removal until eighteen months after the date of conveyance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) annually during the term of such agreement, the public housing agency shall pay to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development all income from the project remaining after deducting the amounts necessary (as determined pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) for (i) the payment of reasonable and proper costs of operating, maintaining, and approving such project, (ii) the payments in lieu of taxes authorized hereunder, (iii) the establishment and maintenance of reasonable and proper reserves as approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and (iv) the payment of currently maturing installments of principal of and interest on any indebtedness incurred by such public housing agency with the approval of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: <em>Provided</em>, That the provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable to any project which is consolidated under a single contract with one or more low-rent projects being assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], and all income from any such project conveyed under this section may be commingled with funds of the project or projects with which it is consolidated and applied in accordance with the requirements of the consolidated contract and the provisions of section 10(c) of the said Act [42 U.S.C. 1410(c)];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) during the term of such agreement, the project shall be exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by the State, city, county, or other political subdivisions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) for the tax year in which the conveyance is made and the next succeeding tax year annual payments in lieu of taxes may be made to the State, city, county, or other political subdivisions in amounts not in excess of the real property taxes which would be paid to such State, city, county, or other political subdivisions if the project were not exempt from taxation; and thereafter, during the term of such agreement, payments in lieu of taxes with respect to the project may be made in annual amounts which do not exceed 10 per centum of the annual shelter rents charged in such project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in selecting tenants for such project, the public housing agency shall give such preferences as are prescribed by subsection 10(g) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1410g], except that for one year after the date of conveyance of a project, the public housing agency shall, to the extent permitted by law, give such preferences, by allocation or otherwise, to military personnel as the Secretary of Defense or his designee prescribes to the public housing agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) upon the occurrence of a substantial default in respect to the requirements and conditions to which the public housing agency is subject (as such substantial default shall be defined in such agreement), the public housing agency shall be obligated at the option of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, either to convey title in any case where, in the determination of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, (which determination shall be final and conclusive), such conveyance of title is necessary to achieve the purposes of this subchapter and the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], or to deliver possession to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of the project, as then constituted, to which such agreement relates: <em>Provided</em>, That in the event of such conveyance of title or delivery of possession, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may improve and administer such project as low-rent housing, and otherwise deal with such housing or parts thereof, subject, however, to the limitations contained in the applicable provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be obligated to reconvey or to redeliver possession of the project, as constituted at the time of reconveyance or redelivery, to such public housing agency or to its successor (if such public housing agency or a successor exists) upon such terms as shall be prescribed in such agreement and as soon as practicable after the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be satisfied that all defaults with respect to the project have been cured, and that the project will, in order to fulfill the purposes of this subchapter and the United States Housing Act of 1937, thereafter be operated in accordance with the terms of such agreement. Any prior conveyances and re<!-- PDFPage:2993 -->conveyances, deliveries and redeliveries of possession shall not exhaust the right to require a conveyance or delivery of possession of the project to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this paragraph upon the subsequent occurrence of a substantial default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Disposition of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of each fiscal year, the total amount of payments during such year to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in accordance with subsection (c) of this section shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1587. Disposition of other permanent war housing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Public interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, subject to the provisions of this section, dispose of permanent war housing, other than housing conveyed pursuant to section 1586 of this title, as promptly as practicable and in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preference in sales to individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Preference in the purchase of any dwelling structure designed for occupancy by not more than four families and offered for separate sale shall be granted to occupants and to veterans over other prospective purchasers for such period as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may determine and in the following order:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a veteran who occupies a unit in the dwelling structure to be sold and who intends to continue to occupy such unit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a nonveteran who occupies a unit in the dwelling structure to be sold and who intends to continue to occupy such unit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a veteran who intends to occupy a unit in the dwelling structure to be sold.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the above order of preference, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may establish subordinate preferences for any such dwelling structure. In the disposition of any dwellings under this section which were acquired by the United States from persons occupying the dwellings at the time of such acquisition, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, notwithstanding the order of preference provided in this section, grant a first preference to such persons in the purchase of any of these dwellings for such period and under such conditions as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate and in the public interest. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;veteran&rdquo; shall include a veteran, a serviceman, or the family of a veteran or a serviceman, or the family of a deceased veteran or serviceman whose death has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2994 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preference in sales of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any housing project required by this section to be disposed of, which is not offered for separate sale of separate dwelling structures designed for occupancy by not more than four families, such project may be sold as a whole or in such portions as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may determine. On such sales of an entire project or portions thereof consisting of more than one dwelling structure or of an individual dwelling structure designed for occupancy by more than four families, first preference shall be given for such period not less than ninety days nor more than six months from the date of the initial offering of such project or portions thereof as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may determine, to groups of veterans organized on a mutual ownership or cooperative basis (provided that any such group shall accept as a member of its organization, on the same terms, subject to the same conditions, and with the same privileges and responsibilities, required of, and extended to other members of the group any tenant occupying a dwelling unit in such project, portion thereof or building, at any time during such period as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall deem appropriate, starting on the date of the announcement by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of the availability of such project, portion thereof or building for sale), except that a first preference for said period of not less than ninety days nor more than six months shall be given to any group organized on a mutual or cooperative basis, which, with respect to its proposed purchase of a specific housing project or portions thereof, has, prior to August 1, 1949, been granted an exception by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development from the sales preference provisions of Public Regulation 1 of the Housing and Home Finance Agency and has been designated as a preferred purchaser.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Equitable selection method for each preference class</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall provide an equitable method of selecting the purchasers to apply when preferred purchasers (or groups of preferred purchasers) in the same preference class or containing members in the same preference class compete with each other.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Veterans&rsquo; preference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any housing disposed of in accordance with this section shall after such disposal be deemed to be housing accommodations the construction of which was completed after June 30, 1947, within the meaning of section 1884 of Appendix to title 50, relating to preference or priority to veterans of World War II or their families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Terms of sales</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Sales pursuant to this section shall be upon such terms as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall determine: <em>Provided</em>, That full payment to the Government for the property sold shall be required within a period not exceeding twenty-five years with interest on unpaid balances at not less than 4 per centum per annum, except that in the case of projects initially programmed as mutual housing communities under the defense housing program, the terms of sale shall not require a down payment and shall provide for full payment to the United States over a period of forty-five years with interest on unpaid balances at not more than 3 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disregard of preferences in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may dispose of any permanent war housing without regard to the preferences in subsections (b) and (c) of this section when the Secretary determines that (1) such housing, because of design or lack of amenities, is unsuitable for family dwelling use, or (2) it is being used at the time of disposition for other than dwelling purposes, or (3) it was offered, with preferences substantially similar to those provided in the Housing Act of 1950, to veterans and occupants prior to April 20, 1950.</p>
