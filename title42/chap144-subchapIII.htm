<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) direct support workers, especially young adults, have played essential roles in providing the support needed by individuals with developmental disabilities and expanding community options for those individuals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 4 factors have contributed to a decrease in the available pool of direct support workers, specifically&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the small population of individuals who are age 18 through 25, an age group that has been attracted to direct support work in the past;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the rapid expansion of the service sector, which attracts individuals who previously would have elected to pursue employment as direct support workers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the failure of wages in the human services sector to keep pace with wages in other service sectors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the lack of quality training and career advancement opportunities available to direct support workers; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) individuals with developmental disabilities benefit from assistance from direct support workers who are well trained, and benefit from receiving services from professionals who have spent time as direct support workers.</p>
