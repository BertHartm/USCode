<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the fastest, most cost-effective, and most environmentally sound way to prevent future energy shortages in the United States, while reducing the Nation's dependence on imported energy supplies, is to encourage and facilitate, through major programs, the implementation of energy conservation and renewable-resource energy measures with respect to dwelling units, nonresidential buildings, and industrial plants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) current efforts to encourage and facilitate such measures are inadequate as a consequence of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a lack of adequate and available financing for such measures, particularly with respect to individual consumers and owners of small businesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a shortage of reliable and impartial information and advisory services pertaining to practicable energy conservation measures and renewable-resource energy measures and the cost savings that are likely if they are implemented in such units, buildings, and plants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the absence of organized programs which, if they existed, would enable consumers, especially individuals and owners of small businesses, to undertake such measures easily and with confidence in their economic value;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) major programs of financial incentives and assistance for energy conservation measures and renewable-resource energy measures in dwelling units, nonresidential buildings, and industrial plants would&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) significantly reduce the Nation's demand for energy and the need for petroleum imports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) cushion the adverse impact of the high price of energy supplies on consumers, particularly elderly and handicapped low-income persons who cannot afford to make the modifications necessary to reduce their residential energy use; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increase, directly and indirectly, job opportunities and national economic output;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the primary responsibility for the implementation of such major programs should be lodged with the governments of the States; the diversity of conditions among the various States and regions of the Nation is sufficiently great that a wholly federally administered program would not be as effective as one which is tailored to meet local requirements and to respond to local opportunities; the State should be allowed flexibility within which to fashion such programs, subject to general Federal guidelines and monitoring sufficient to protect the financial investments of consumers and the financial interest of the United States and to insure that the measures undertaken in fact result in significant energy and cost savings which would probably not otherwise occur;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to the extent that direct Federal administration is more economical and efficient, direct Federal financial incentives and assistance should be extended through existing and proven Federal programs rather than through new programs that would necessitate new and separate administrative bureaucracies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such programs should be designed and administered to supplement, and not to supplant or in any other way conflict with, State energy conservation programs under part C of title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act [42 U.S.C. 6321 et seq.]; the emergency energy conservation program carried out by community action agencies pursuant to section 2809(a)(12)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6851_1_target" name="6851_1">1</a></sup> of this title; and other forms of assistance and encouragement for energy conservation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is, therefore, the purpose of this subchapter to encourage and facilitate the implementation of energy conservation measures and renewable-resource energy measures in dwelling units, nonresidential buildings, and industrial plants, through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) supplemental State energy conservation plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Federal financial incentives and assistance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) States, through Community Action Agencies established under the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2701 et seq.] and units of general purpose local government, should be encouraged, with Federal financial and technical assistance, to develop and support coordinated weatherization programs designed to alleviate the adverse effects of energy costs on such low-income persons, to supplement other Federal programs serving such low-income persons, and to increase energy efficiency.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Development and conduct of program by Secretary; grants to States and Indian tribal organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop and conduct, in accordance with the purpose and provisions of this part, a weatherization program. In developing and conducting such program, the Secretary may, in accordance with this part and regulations promulgated under this part, make grants (1) to States, and (2) in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, to Indian tribal organizations to serve Native Americans. Such grants shall be made for the purpose of providing financial assistance with regard to projects designed to provide for the weatherization of dwelling units, particularly those where elderly or handicapped low-income persons reside, occupied by low-income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consultation by Secretary with other Federal departments and agencies on development and publication in Federal Register of proposed regulations; required regulatory provisions; standards and procedures; rental units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary, after consultation with the Director, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Labor, and the heads of such other Federal departments and agencies as the Secretary deems appropriate, shall develop and publish in the Federal Register for public comment, not later than 60 days after August 14, 1976, proposed regulations to carry out the provisions of this part. The Secretary shall take into consideration comments submitted regarding such proposed regulations and shall promulgate and publish final regulations for such purpose not later than 90 days after August 14, 1976. The development of regulations under this part shall be fully coordinated with the Director.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The regulations promulgated pursuant to this section shall include provisions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prescribing, in coordination with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Director of the National Institute of Standards and Technology in the Department of Commerce, for use in various climatic, structural, and human need settings, standards for weatherization materials, energy conservation techniques, and balance combinations thereof, which are designed to achieve a balance of a healthful dwelling environment and maximum practicable energy conservation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that provide guidance to the States in the implementation of this part, including guidance designed to ensure that a State establishes (i) procedures that provide protection under paragraph (5) to tenants paying for energy as a portion of their rent, and (ii) a process for monitoring compliance with its obligations pursuant to this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that secure the Federal investment made under this part and address the issues of eviction from and sale of property receiving weatherization materials under this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary, in coordination with the Secretaries and Director described in paragraph (2)(A) and with the Director of the Community Services Administration and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall develop and publish in the Federal Register for public comment, not later than 60 days after November 9, 1978, proposed amendments to the regulations prescribed under paragraph (1). Such amendments shall provide that the standards described in paragraph (2)(A) shall include a set of procedures to be applied to each dwelling unit to determine the optimum set of cost-effective measures, within the cost guidelines set for the program, to be installed in such dwelling unit. Such standards shall, in order to achieve such optimum savings of energy, take into consideration the following factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the cost of the weatherization material;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) variation in climate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the value of energy saved by the application of the weatherization material.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such standards shall be utilized by the Secretary in carrying out this part, the Secretary of Agriculture in carrying out the weatherization program under section 1474(c) of this title, and the Director of the Community Services Administration in carrying out weatherization programs under section 222(a)(12) of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2809(a)(12)]. The Secretary shall take into consideration comments submitted regarding such proposed amendment and shall promulgate and publish final amended regulations not later than 120 days after November 9, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In carrying out paragraphs (2)(A) and (3), the Secretary shall establish the standards and procedures described in such paragraphs so that weatherization efforts being carried out under this part and under programs described in the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) will accomplish uniform results among the States in any area with a similar climatic condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In any case in which a dwelling consists of a rental unit or rental units, the State, in the implementation of this part, shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the benefits of weatherization assistance in connection with such rental units, including units where the tenants pay for their energy through their rent, will accrue primarily to the low-income tenants residing in such units;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for a reasonable period of time after weatherization work has been completed on a dwelling containing a unit occupied by an eligible household, the tenants in that unit (including households paying for their energy through their rent) will not be subjected to rent increases unless those increases are demonstrably related to matters other than the weatherization work performed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the enforcement of subparagraph (B) is provided through procedures established by the State by which tenants may file complaints and owners, in response to such complaints, shall demonstrate that the rent increase concerned is related to matters other than the weatherization work performed; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5308 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) no undue or excessive enhancement will occur to the value of such dwelling units.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) As a condition of having assistance provided under this part with respect to multifamily buildings, a State may require financial participation from the owners of such buildings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Failure of State to submit application; alternate application by any unit of general purpose local government or community action agency; submission of amended application by State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State does not, within 90 days after the date on which final regulations are promulgated under this section, submit an application to the Secretary which meets the requirements set forth in section 6864 of this title, any unit of general purpose local government of sufficient size (as determined by the Secretary), or a community action agency carrying out programs under title II of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2781 et seq.], may, in lieu of such State, submit an application (meeting such requirements and subject to all other provisions of this part) for carrying out projects under this part within the geographical area which is subject to the jurisdiction of such government or is served by such agency. A State may, in accordance with regulations promulgated under this part, submit an amended application.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Direct grants to low-income members of Indian tribal organizations or alternate service organizations; application for funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, in any State in which the Secretary determines (after having taken into account the amount of funds made available to the State to carry out the purposes of this part) that the low-income members of an Indian tribe are not receiving benefits under this part that are equivalent to the assistance provided to other low-income persons in such State under this part, and if he further determines that the members of such tribe would be better served by means of a grant made directly to provide such assistance, he shall reserve from sums that would otherwise be allocated to such State under this part not less than 100 percent, nor more than 150 percent, of an amount which bears the same ratio to the State's allocation for the fiscal year involved as the population of all low-income Indians for whom a determination under this subsection has been made bears to the population of all low-income persons in such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The sums reserved by the Secretary on the basis of his determination under this subsection shall be granted to the tribal organization serving the individuals for whom such a determination has been made, or, where there is no tribal organization, to such other entity as he determines has the capacity to provide services pursuant to this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In order for a tribal organization or other entity to be eligible for a grant for a fiscal year under this subsection, it shall submit to the Secretary an application meeting the requirements set forth in section 6864 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfer of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may transfer to the Director sums appropriated under this part to be utilized in order to carry out programs, under section 222(a)(12) of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2809(a)(12)], which further the purpose of this part.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; requirements for guarantees and commitments to guarantee; procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may, in accordance with this section and such rules as he shall prescribe after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, guarantee and issue commitments to guarantee the payment of the outstanding principal amount of any loan, note, bond, or other obligation evidencing indebtedness, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such obligation is entered into or issued by any person or by any State, political subdivision of a State, or agency and instrumentality of either a State or political subdivision thereof; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the purpose of entering into or issuing such obligation is the financing of any energy conservation measure or renewable-resource energy measure which is to be installed or otherwise implemented in any building or industrial plant owned or operated by the person or State, political subdivision of a State, or agency or instrumentality of either a State or political subdivision thereof, (i) which enters into or issues such obligation, or (ii) to which such measure is leased.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No guarantee or commitment to guarantee may be issued under this subsection with respect to any obligation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which is a general obligation of a State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which is entered into or issued for the purpose of financing any energy conservation measure or renewable-resource energy measure which is to be installed or otherwise implemented in a residential building containing 2 or fewer dwelling units.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Before prescribing rules pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Small Business Administration in order to formulate procedures which would assist small business concerns in obtaining guarantees and commitments to guarantee under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Preconditions for issuance of guarantees and commitments to guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No obligation may be guaranteed, and no commitment to guarantee an obligation may be issued, under subsection (a) of this section, unless the Secretary finds that the measure which is to be financed by such obligation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has been identified by an energy audit to be an energy conservation measure or a renewable-resource energy measure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is included on a list of energy conservation measures and renewable-resource energy measures which the Secretary publishes under section 6325(e)(1) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before issuing a guarantee under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may require that an energy audit be conducted with respect to an energy conservation measure or a renewable-resource energy measure which is on a list described in paragraph (2) and which is to be financed by the obligation to be guaranteed under this section. The amount of any obligation which may be guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section may include the cost of an energy audit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitations on availability of guarantees; term of guarantees; aggregate outstanding principal amount of obligations of one borrower</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall limit the availability of a guarantee otherwise authorized by subsection (a) of this section to obligations entered into by or issued by borrowers who can demonstrate that financing is not otherwise available on reasonable terms and conditions to allow the measure to be financed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No obligation may be guaranteed by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section unless the Secretary finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there is a reasonable prospect for the repayment of such obligation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an obligation issued by a person, such obligation constitutes a general obligation of such person for such guarantee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The term of any guarantee issued under subsection (a) of this section may not exceed 25 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The aggregate outstanding principal amount which may be guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section at any one time with respect to obligations entered into or issued by any borrower may not exceed $5,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitations on original principal amount guaranteed; revocation of guarantees and commitments to guarantee; conclusiveness of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The original principal amount guaranteed under subsection (a) may not exceed 90 percent of the cost of the energy conservation measure or the renewable-resource energy measure financed by the obligation guaranteed under such subsection; except that such amount may not exceed 25 percent of the fair market value of the building or industrial plant being modified by such energy conservation measure or renewable-resource energy measure. No guarantee issued, and no commitment to guarantee, which is issued under subsection (a) of this section shall be terminated, canceled, or otherwise revoked except in accordance with reasonable terms and conditions prescribed by the Secretary, after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, and contained in the written guarantee or commitment to guarantee. The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees made under subsection (a) of this section. Any such guarantee made by the Secretary shall be conclusive evidence of the eligibility of the obligation involved for such guarantee, and the validity of any guarantee so made shall be incontestable in the hands of a holder of the guaranteed obligation except for fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of such holder.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5318 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Information and assurances required prior to guarantees and commitments to guarantee; maintenance and availability of records; fees to borrowers; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No guarantee and no commitment to guarantee may be issued under subsection (a) of this section unless the Secretary obtains any information reasonably requested and such assurances as are in his judgment (after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury) reasonable to protect the interests of the United States and to assure that such guarantee or commitment to guarantee is consistent with and will further the purpose of this subchapter. The Secretary shall require that records be kept and made available to the Secretary or the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, in such detail and form as are determined necessary to facilitate (A) an effective financial audit of the energy conservation measure or renewable-resource energy measure investment involved, and (B) an adequate evaluation of the effectiveness of this section. The Secretary and the Comptroller General, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access to pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of any recipient of Federal assistance under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may collect a fee from any borrower with respect to whose obligation a guarantee or commitment to guarantee is issued under subsection (a) of this section; except that the Secretary may waive any such fee with respect to any such borrower or class of borrowers. Fees shall be designed to recover the estimated administrative expenses incurred under this part; except that the total of the fees charged any such borrower may not exceed (A) one percent of the amount of the guarantee, or (B) one-half percent of the amount of the commitment to guarantee, whichever is greater. Any amount collected under this paragraph shall be deposited in the miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Default in payment of principal due under guaranteed obligation; procedures applicable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If there is a default by the obligor in any payment of principal due under an obligation guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section, and if such default continues for 30 days, the holder of such obligation or his agent has the right to demand payment by the Secretary of the unpaid principal of such obligation, consistent with the terms of the guarantee of such obligation. Such payment may be demanded within such period as may be specified in the guarantee or related agreements, which period shall expire not later than 90 days from the date of such default. If demand occurs within such specified period, then not later than 60 days from the date of such demand, the Secretary shall pay to such holder the unpaid principal of such obligation, consistent with the terms of the guarantee of such obligation; except that (A) the Secretary shall not be required to make any such payment if he finds, prior to the expiration of the 60-day period beginning on the date on which the demand is made, that there was no default by the obligor in the payment of principal or that such default has been remedied, and (B) no such holder shall receive payment or be entitled to retain payment in a total amount which together with any other recovery (including any recovery based upon any security interest) exceeds the actual loss of principal by such holder.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary makes payment to a holder under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall thereupon&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) have all of the rights granted to him by law or agreement with the obligor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) be subrogated to all of the rights which were granted such holder, by law, assignment, or security agreement applicable to the guaranteed obligation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may, in his discretion, take possession of, complete, recondition, reconstruct, renovate, repair, maintain, operate, remove, charter, rent, sell, or otherwise dispose of any property or other interests obtained by him pursuant to this subsection. The terms of any such sale or other disposition shall be as approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If there is a default by the obligor in any payment due under an obligation guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall take such action against such obligor or any other person as is, in his discretion, necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the United States. Such an action may be brought in the name of the United States or in the name of the holder of such obligation. Such holder shall make available to the Secretary all records and evidence necessary to prosecute any such suit. The Secretary may, in his discretion, accept a conveyance of property in full or partial satisfaction of any sums owed to him. If the Secretary receives, through the sale of property, an amount greater than his cost and the amount paid to the holder under paragraph (1), he shall pay such excess to the obligor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limitation on aggregate outstanding principal amount of obligations guaranteed; time limitation on guarantees and commitments to guarantee; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The aggregate outstanding principal amount of obligations which may be guaranteed under this section may not at any one time exceed $2,000,000,000. No guarantee or commitment to guarantee may be issued under subsection (a) of this section after September 30, 1979.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There is authorized to be appropriated for the payment of amounts to be paid under subsection (f) of this section, not to exceed $60,000,000. Any amount appropriated pursuant to this paragraph shall remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this part, including administrative costs, but not for the payment of amounts to be paid under subsection (f) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1977, not to exceed $1,836,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, not to exceed $4,950,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Wages paid laborers and mechanics; labor standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All laborers and mechanics employed in construction, alteration, or repair which is financed <!-- PDFPage:5319 -->by an obligation guaranteed under subsection (a) of this section shall be paid wages at rates not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with sections 3141&ndash;3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40. The Secretary shall not guarantee any obligations under subsection (a) of this section without first obtaining adequate assurance that these labor standards will be maintained during such construction, alteration, or repair.
