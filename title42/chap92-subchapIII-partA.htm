<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether or not it is financially feasible to use coal or another alternate fuel as a primary energy source in such a powerplant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority of Secretary to prohibit where coal or alternate fuel capability exists</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prohibit, in accordance with section 8343(a) or (b) of this title, the use of petroleum or natural gas, or both, as a primary energy source in any existing electric powerplant, if an affirmative certification under subsection (a)(1), (2), and (3) of this section is in effect with respect to such powerplant and if, after examining the basis for the certification, the Secretary concurs with the certification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority of Secretary to prohibit excessive use in mixtures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At any time, the owner or operator of an existing electric powerplant may certify to the Secretary for purposes of this subsection whether or not it is technically and financially feasible to use a mixture of petroleum or natural gas and coal or another alternate fuel as a primary energy source in that powerplant. If an affirmative certification under this subsection is in effect with respect to such powerplant and if, after examining the basis for the certification, the Secretary concurs with the certification, the Secretary may prohibit, in accordance with section 8343(a) of this title, the use of petroleum or natural gas, or both, in such powerplant in amounts in excess of the minimum amount necessary to maintain reliability of operation of the unit consistent with maintaining reasonable fuel efficiency of such mixture.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amendment of subsection (a) and (c) certifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The owner or operator of any such powerplant may at any time amend any certification under subsection (a) or (c) of this section in order to take into account changes in relevant facts and circumstances; except that no such amendment to such a certification may be made after the date of any final prohibition under subsection (b) or (c) of this section based on that certification.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except to the extent authorized by subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall prohibit any powerplant from using natural gas or petroleum under the authority granted him under section 8341(b) or (c) of this title only by means of a final order issued by him which shall be limited to the particular powerplant involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may prohibit, by rule, the use of natural gas or petroleum under section 8341(b) of this title in existing electric powerplants.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) In prescribing any final rule under this subsection, the Secretary shall take into account any special circumstances or characteristics of each category of powerplants (such as the intermittent use, size, age, or geographic location of such powerplants). Any such rules shall not apply in the case of any existing electric powerplant with respect to which a comparable prohibition was issued by order.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall not issue a final order under this subsection to any powerplant if it is demonstrated that such powerplant would have been granted an exemption if such prohibition had been established by a final rule pursuant to subsection (b) of this section rather than by order pursuant to this subsection, except that if a temporary exemption would have been granted, such a final order may be issued but may not take effect until such time as the temporary exemption would have terminated.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(B) In any case in which an order is not issued by reason of subparagraph (A) or in which the effective date of such order is delayed under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall take such steps as may be necessary to assure the installation involved complies with the same requirements (including provisions of section 8354(a) of this title) as would have been applicable if an exemption had been granted based upon the grounds for which the order is not issued or the effective date of which is delayed.&rdquo;</p>
