<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Terms defined in part A</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The definitions applicable to part A under section 7550 of this title shall also apply for purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Clean alternative fuel</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;clean alternative fuel&rdquo; means any fuel (including methanol, ethanol, or <!-- PDFPage:4994 -->other alcohols (including any mixture thereof containing 85 percent or more by volume of such alcohol with gasoline or other fuels), reformulated gasoline, diesel, natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas, and hydrogen) or power source (including electricity) used in a clean-fuel vehicle that complies with the standards and requirements applicable to such vehicle under this subchapter when using such fuel or power source. In the case of any flexible fuel vehicle or dual fuel vehicle, the term &ldquo;clean alternative fuel&rdquo; means only a fuel with respect to which such vehicle was certified as a clean-fuel vehicle meeting the standards applicable to clean-fuel vehicles under section 7583(d)(2) of this title when operating on clean alternative fuel (or any CARB standards which replaces such standards pursuant to section 7583(e) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) NMOG</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term nonmethane organic gas (&ldquo;NMOG&rdquo;) means the sum of nonoxygenated and oxygenated hydrocarbons contained in a gas sample, including, at a minimum, all oxygenated organic gases containing 5 or fewer carbon atoms (i.e., aldehydes, ketones, alcohols, ethers, etc.), and all known alkanes, alkenes, alkynes, and aromatics containing 12 or fewer carbon atoms. To demonstrate compliance with a NMOG standard, NMOG emissions shall be measured in accordance with the &ldquo;California Non-Methane Organic Gas Test Procedures&rdquo;. In the case of vehicles using fuels other than base gasoline, the level of NMOG emissions shall be adjusted based on the reactivity of the emissions relative to vehicles using base gasoline.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Base gasoline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;base gasoline&rdquo; means gasoline which meets the following specifications:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Administrator shall modify the definitions of NMOG, base gasoline, and the methods for making reactivity adjustments, to conform to the definitions and method used in California under the Low-Emission Vehicle and Clean Fuel Regulations of the California Air Resources Board, so long as the California definitions are, in the aggregate, at least as protective of public health and welfare as the definitions in this section.</p>
