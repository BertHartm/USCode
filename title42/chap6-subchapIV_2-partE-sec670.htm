<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) throughout the Nation, the number of infants and young children who have been exposed to drugs taken by their mothers during pregnancy has increased dramatically;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the inability of parents who abuse drugs to provide adequate care for such infants and young children and a lack of suitable shelter homes for such infants and young children have led to the abandonment of such infants and young children in hospitals for extended periods;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) an unacceptable number of these infants and young children will be medically cleared for discharge, yet remain in hospitals as boarder babies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) hospital-based child care for these infants and young children is extremely costly and deprives them of an adequate nurturing environment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) training is inadequate for foster care personnel working with medically fragile infants and young children and infants and young children exposed to drugs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) a particularly devastating development is the increase in the number of infants and young children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (which is believed to cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome and which is commonly known as HIV) or who have been perinatally exposed to the virus or to a dangerous drug;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) many such infants and young children have at least one parent who is an intravenous drug abuser;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) such infants and young children are particularly difficult to place in foster homes, and are being abandoned in hospitals in increasing numbers by mothers dying of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or by parents incapable of providing adequate care;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) there is a need for comprehensive services for such infants and young children, including foster family care services, case management services, family support services, respite and crisis intervention services, counseling services, and group residential home services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) there is a need to support the families of such infants and young children through the provision of services that will prevent the abandonment of the infants and children; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) there is a need for the development of funding strategies that coordinate and make the optimal use of all private resources, and Federal, State, and local resources, to establish and maintain such services.</p>
