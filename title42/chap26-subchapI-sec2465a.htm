<p class="statutory-body">(2) The term &ldquo;compelling circumstances&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to, occasions when the Administrator determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, that important national security or foreign policy interests would be served by a Shuttle launch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The policy stated in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall not preclude the use of available cargo space, on a Space Shuttle mission otherwise consistent with the policy described under subsection (a)(1) of this section, for the purpose of carrying secondary payloads (as defined by the Administrator) that do not require the presence of man if such payloads are consistent with the requirements of research, development, demonstration, scientific, commercial, and educational programs authorized by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Implementation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall, within six months after November 16, 1990, submit a report to the Congress setting forth a plan for the implementation of the policy described in subsection (a)(1) of this section. Such plan shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">At least annually, the Administrator shall submit to the Congress a report certifying that the payloads scheduled to be launched on the space shuttle for the next four years are consistent with the policy set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section. For each payload scheduled to be launched from the space shuttle, which do not require the presence of man, the Administrator shall, in the certified report to Congress, state the specific circumstances which justified the use of the space shuttle. If, during the period between scheduled reports to the Congress, any additions are made to the list of certified payloads intended to be launched from the Shuttle, the Administrator shall inform the Congress of the additions and the reasons therefor within 45 days of the change.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) NASA payloads</h4>
