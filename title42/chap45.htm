<h4 class="note-head">Federal Leadership of Fair Housing</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 17, 1994, 59 F.R. 8513, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">On April 11, 1968, one week after the assassination of the great civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.] was enacted (1) to prohibit discrimination in housing, and (2) to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to affirmatively further fair housing in Federal housing and urban development programs. Twenty-five years later, despite a strengthening of the Fair Housing Act 5 years ago, hundreds of acts of housing discrimination occur in our Nation each day.</p>
<p class="note-body">Americans of every income level, seeking to live where they choose, feel the weight of discrimination because of the color of their skin, their race, their religion, their gender, their country of origin, or because they are disabled or have children.</p>
<p class="note-body">An increasing body of evidence indicates that barriers to fair housing are pervasive. Forty percent of all families move every 5 years. This statistic is significant given the results of a recent study, commissioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which found that more than half of the African Americans and Latinos seeking to rent or buy a home are treated differently than whites with the same qualifications. Moreover, based upon Home Mortgage Disclosure Act [12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] data, the number of minority persons who are rejected when attempting to obtain loans to purchase homes is two to three times higher than it is for nonminorities in almost every metropolitan area of this country.</p>
<p class="note-body">Racial and ethnic segregation, both in the private housing market and in public and assisted housing, has been well documented. Despite legislation (the Fair Housing Act) and Executive action (Executive Order No. 11063 [42 U.S.C. 1982 note]), the divisive impact of housing segregation persists in metropolitan areas all across this country. Too many lower income and minority Americans face barriers to housing outside of central cities. Segregation in housing and schools deprives too many of our children and youth of an opportunity to enter the marketplace or work on an equal footing. For too many families, our cities are no longer the launching pads for economic self-sufficiency and upward mobility that they have been for countless immigrants and minorities since the country's birth. And many Americans who are better off abandon the cities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The resulting decline in the very heart of too many of our metropolitan areas threatens all of us: the health of our dynamic regional economies&mdash;the very lifeblood of future national economic growth and higher living standards for all of us and all of our children&mdash;is placed at risk.</p>
<p class="note-body">We can do better. We can start by making sure that our own Federal policies and programs across all of our agencies support the fair housing and equal opportunity goals to which all Americans are committed. If all of our executive agencies affirmatively further fair housing in the design of their policies and administration of their programs relating to housing and urban development, a truly nondiscriminatory housing market will be closer to achievement.</p>
<p class="note-body">By an Executive Order [Ex. Ord. No. 12892, set out above] (&ldquo;the Order&rdquo;) I am issuing today and this memorandum, I am addressing those needs. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and, where appropriate, the Attorney General&mdash;the officials with the primary responsibility for the enforcement of Federal fair housing laws&mdash;will take the lead in developing and coordinating measures to carry out the purposes of this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body">Through this Order, I am first expanding Executive Order No. 11063 to provide protection against discrimination in programs of Federal insurance or guaranty to persons who are disabled and to families with children.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, I am revoking the old Executive Order No. 12259 entitled &ldquo;Leadership and Coordination of Fair Housing in Federal Programs.&rdquo; The new Executive order reflects the expanded authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and I am directing him to take stronger measures to provide leadership and coordination in affirmatively furthering fair housing in Federal programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, I ask the heads of departments and agencies, including the Federal banking agencies, to cooperate with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in identifying ways to structure agency programs and activities to affirmatively further fair housing and to promptly negotiate memoranda of understanding with him to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Further, I direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to review all of HUD's programs to assure that they truly provide equal opportunity and promote economic self-sufficiency for those who are beneficiaries and recipients of those programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">I also direct the Secretary to review HUD's programs to assure that they contain the maximum incentives to affirmatively further fair housing and to eliminate barriers to free choice where they continue to exist. This review shall include Federally assisted housing, Federally insured housing and other housing and housing related programs, including those of the Government National Mortgage Association and the Federal Housing Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, I am establishing a new Cabinet-level organization to focus the cooperative efforts of all agencies on fair housing. The President's Fair Housing Council will be chaired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and will consist of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Interior, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The President's Fair Housing Council shall review the design and delivery of Federal programs and activi<!-- PDFPage:3250 -->ties to ensure that they support a coordinated strategy to affirmatively further fair housing. The Council shall propose revisions to existing programs or activities, develop pilot programs and activities, and propose new programs and activities to achieve its goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">I direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the President's Fair Housing Council to develop a pilot program to be implemented in selected metropolitan areas. This initiative will promote fair housing choice by helping inner-city families to move to suburban neighborhoods and by making the central city more attractive to those who have left it. I direct the members of the Council to undertake a demonstration program that will reinvent the way assisted housing is offered to applicants, will break down jurisdictional barriers in housing opportunities, and will promote the use of subsidies that diminish residential segregation, and will combine these initiatives with refined educational incentives aimed at improving the effectiveness of inner-city schools. I am directing that transportation alternatives be considered along with targeted social service and job training programs as part of the support necessary to create a one-stop, metropolitan area-wide fair housing opportunity pilot program that will effectively offer Federally assisted housing, Federally insured housing, and private market housing within a metropolitan area to all residents of the area. The pilot program should call upon realtors, mortgage lenders, housing providers, and local governments, among others, to assist in expanding housing choices.</p>
<p class="note-body">To address the findings of recent studies, I hereby direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Attorney General and, where appropriate, the heads of the Federal banking agencies to exercise national leadership to end discrimination in mortgage lending, the secondary mortgage market, and property insurance practices. The Secretary is directed to issue regulations to define discriminatory practices in these areas and the Secretary and the Attorney General are directed to aggressively enforce the laws prohibiting these practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">In each of these areas, I direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to take the lead with the other Federal agencies in working to gain the voluntary cooperation, participation, and expertise of all of those in private industry, the States and localities who can assist in achieving the Nation's fair housing goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Failure to comply with conciliation agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary has reasonable cause to believe that a respondent has breached a conciliation agreement, the Secretary shall refer the matter to the Attorney General with a recommendation that a civil action be filed under section 3614 of this title for the enforcement of such agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prohibitions and requirements with respect to disclosure of information</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prompt judicial action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary concludes at any time following the filing of a complaint that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary may authorize a civil action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint under this section. Upon receipt of such an authorization, the Attorney General shall promptly commence and maintain such an action. Any temporary restraining order or other order granting preliminary or temporary relief shall be issued in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The commencement of a civil action under this subsection does not affect the initiation or continuation of administrative proceedings under this section and section 3612 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that a basis may exist for the commencement of proceedings against any respondent under sections 3614(a) and 3614(c) of this title or for proceedings by any governmental licensing or supervisory authorities, the Secretary shall transmit the information upon which such belief is based to the Attorney General, or to such authorities, as the case may be.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3252 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Referral for State or local proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever a complaint alleges a discriminatory housing practice&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within the jurisdiction of a State or local public agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as to which such agency has been certified by the Secretary under this subsection;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall refer such complaint to that certified agency before taking any action with respect to such complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except with the consent of such certified agency, the Secretary, after that referral is made, shall take no further action with respect to such complaint unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the certified agency has failed to commence proceedings with respect to the complaint before the end of the 30th day after the date of such referral;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the certified agency, having so commenced such proceedings, fails to carry forward such proceedings with reasonable promptness; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary determines that the certified agency no longer qualifies for certification under this subsection with respect to the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary may certify an agency under this subsection only if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the substantive rights protected by such agency in the jurisdiction with respect to which certification is to be made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the procedures followed by such agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the remedies available to such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the availability of judicial review of such agency's action;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">are substantially equivalent to those created by and under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Before making such certification, the Secretary shall take into account the current practices and past performance, if any, of such agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) During the period which begins on September 13, 1988, and ends 40 months after September 13, 1988, each agency certified (including an agency certified for interim referrals pursuant to 24 CFR 115.11, unless such agency is subsequently denied recognition under 24 CFR 115.7) for the purposes of this subchapter on the day before September 13, 1988, shall for the purposes of this subsection be considered certified under this subsection with respect to those matters for which such agency was certified on September 13, 1988. If the Secretary determines in an individual case that an agency has not been able to meet the certification requirements within this 40-month period due to exceptional circumstances, such as the infrequency of legislative sessions in that jurisdiction, the Secretary may extend such period by not more than 8 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Not less frequently than every 5 years, the Secretary shall determine whether each agency certified under this subsection continues to qualify for certification. The Secretary shall take appropriate action with respect to any agency not so qualifying.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reasonable cause determination and effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, within 100 days after the filing of the complaint (or, when the Secretary takes further action under subsection (f)(2) of this section with respect to a complaint, within 100 days after the commencement of such further action), determine based on the facts whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, unless it is impracticable to do so, or unless the Secretary has approved a conciliation agreement with respect to the complaint. If the Secretary is unable to make the determination within 100 days after the filing of the complaint (or, when the Secretary takes further action under subsection (f)(2) of this section with respect to a complaint, within 100 days after the commencement of such further action), the Secretary shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the Secretary shall, except as provided in subparagraph (C), immediately issue a charge on behalf of the aggrieved person, for further proceedings under section 3612 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such charge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall consist of a short and plain statement of the facts upon which the Secretary has found reasonable cause to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall be based on the final investigative report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) need not be limited to the facts or grounds alleged in the complaint filed under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Secretary determines that the matter involves the legality of any State or local zoning or other land use law or ordinance, the Secretary shall immediately refer the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate action under section 3614 of this title, instead of issuing such charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines that no reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the Secretary shall promptly dismiss the complaint. The Secretary shall make public disclosure of each such dismissal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not issue a charge under this section regarding an alleged discriminatory housing practice after the beginning of the trial of a civil action commenced by the aggrieved party under an Act of Congress or a State law, seeking relief with respect to that discriminatory housing practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Service of copies of charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the Secretary issues a charge under this section, the Secretary shall cause a copy thereof, together with information as to how to make an election under section 3612(a) of this title and the effect of such an election, to be served&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on each respondent named in such charge, together with a notice of opportunity for a hearing at a time and place specified in the notice, unless that election is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) on each aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Election of judicial determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When a charge is filed under section 3610 of this title, a complainant, a respondent, or an aggrieved person on whose behalf the complaint was filed, may elect to have the claims asserted in that charge decided in a civil action under subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section in lieu of a hearing under subsection (b) of this section. The election must be made not later than 20 days after the receipt by the electing person of service under section 3610(h) of this title or, in the case of the Secretary, not later than 20 days after such service. The person making such election shall give notice of doing so to the Secretary and to all other complainants and respondents to whom the charge relates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative law judge hearing in absence of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an election is not made under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a charge filed under section 3610 of this title, the Secretary shall provide an opportunity for a hearing on the record with respect to a charge issued under section 3610 of this title. The Secretary shall delegate the conduct of a hearing under this section to an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of title 5.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rights of parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At a hearing under this section, each party may appear in person, be represented by counsel, present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and obtain the issuance of subpoenas under section 3611 of this title.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effect of trial of civil action on administrative proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An administrative law judge may not continue administrative proceedings under this section regarding any alleged discriminatory housing practice after the beginning of the trial of a civil action commenced by the aggrieved party under an Act of Congress or a State law, seeking relief with respect to that discriminatory housing practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Hearings, findings and conclusions, and order</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrative law judge shall commence the hearing under this section no later than 120 days following the issuance of the charge, unless it is impracticable to do so.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The administrative law judge shall make findings of fact and conclusions of law within 60 days after the end of the hearing under this section, unless it is impracticable to do so. If the administrative law judge is unable to make findings of fact and conclusions of law within such period, or any succeeding 60-day period thereafter, the administrative law judge shall notify the Secretary, the aggrieved person on whose behalf the charge was filed, and the respondent, in writing of the reasons for not doing so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the administrative law judge finds that a respondent has engaged or is about to engage in a discriminatory housing practice, such administrative law judge shall promptly issue an order for such relief as may be appropriate, which may include actual damages suffered by the aggrieved person and injunctive or other equitable relief. Such order may, to vindicate the public interest, assess a civil penalty against the respondent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in an amount not exceeding $10,000 if the respondent has not been adjudged to have committed any prior discriminatory housing practice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in an amount not exceeding $25,000 if the respondent has been adjudged to have committed one other discriminatory housing practice during the 5-year period ending on the date of the filing of this charge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in an amount not exceeding $50,000 if the respondent has been adjudged to have committed 2 or more discriminatory housing practices during the 7-year period ending on the date of the filing of this charge;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that if the acts constituting the discriminatory housing practice that is the object of the charge are committed by the same natural person who has been previously adjudged to have committed acts constituting a discriminatory housing practice, then the civil penalties set forth in subparagraphs (B) and (C) may be imposed without regard to the period of time within which any subsequent discriminatory housing practice occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No such order shall affect any contract, sale, encumbrance, or lease consummated before the issuance of such order and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant without actual notice of the charge filed under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In the case of an order with respect to a discriminatory housing practice that occurred in the course of a business subject to a licensing or regulation by a governmental agency, the Secretary shall, not later than 30 days after the date of the issuance of such order (or, if such order is judicially reviewed, 30 days after such order is in substance affirmed upon such review)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) send copies of the findings of fact, conclusions of law, and the order, to that governmental agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) recommend to that governmental agency appropriate disciplinary action (including, where appropriate, the suspension or revocation of the license of the respondent).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In the case of an order against a respondent against whom another order was issued within the preceding 5 years under this section, the Secretary shall send a copy of each such order to the Attorney General.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) If the administrative law judge finds that the respondent has not engaged or is not about to engage in a discriminatory housing practice, as the case may be, such administrative law judge shall enter an order dismissing the charge. The Secretary shall make public disclosure of each such dismissal.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may review any finding, conclusion, or order issued under subsection (g) of this section.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Court enforcement of administrative order upon petition by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may petition any United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the discriminatory housing practice is alleged to have occurred or in which any respondent resides or transacts business for the enforcement of the order of the administrative law judge and <!-- PDFPage:3255 -->for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order, by filing in such court a written petition praying that such order be enforced and for appropriate temporary relief or restraining order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall file in court with the petition the record in the proceeding. A copy of such petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the parties to the proceeding before the administrative law judge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Relief which may be granted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the filing of a petition under subsection (i) or (j) of this section, the court may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) grant to the petitioner, or any other party, such temporary relief, restraining order, or other order as the court deems just and proper;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) affirm, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order, or remand the order for further proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) enforce such order to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any party to the proceeding before the administrative law judge may intervene in the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No objection not made before the administrative law judge shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Enforcement decree in absence of petition for review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If no petition for review is filed under subsection (i) of this section before the expiration of 45 days after the date the administrative law judge's order is entered, the administrative law judge's findings of fact and order shall be conclusive in connection with any petition for enforcement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which is filed by the Secretary under subsection (j) of this section after the end of such day; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) under subsection (m) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Court enforcement of administrative order upon petition of any person entitled to relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If before the expiration of 60 days after the date the administrative law judge's order is entered, no petition for review has been filed under subsection (i) of this section, and the Secretary has not sought enforcement of the order under subsection (j) of this section, any person entitled to relief under the order may petition for a decree enforcing the order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the discriminatory housing practice is alleged to have occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Entry of decree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk of the court of appeals in which a petition for enforcement is filed under subsection (<em>l</em>) or (m) of this section shall forthwith enter a decree enforcing the order and shall transmit a copy of such decree to the Secretary, the respondent named in the petition, and to any other parties to the proceeding before the administrative law judge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Civil action for enforcement when election is made for such civil action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an election is made under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall authorize, and not later than 30 days after the election is made the Attorney General shall commence and maintain, a civil action on behalf of the aggrieved person in a United States district court seeking relief under this subsection. Venue for such civil action shall be determined under chapter 87 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any aggrieved person with respect to the issues to be determined in a civil action under this subsection may intervene as of right in that civil action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In a civil action under this subsection, if the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may grant as relief any relief which a court could grant with respect to such discriminatory housing practice in a civil action under section 3613 of this title. Any relief so granted that would accrue to an aggrieved person in a civil action commenced by that aggrieved person under section 3613 of this title shall also accrue to that aggrieved person in a civil action under this subsection. If monetary relief is sought for the benefit of an aggrieved person who does not intervene in the civil action, the court shall not award such relief if that aggrieved person has not complied with discovery orders entered by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Attorney's fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any administrative proceeding brought under this section, or any court proceeding arising therefrom, or any civil action under this section, the administrative law judge or the court, as the case may be, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee and costs. The United States shall be liable for such fees and costs to the extent provided by section 504 of title 5 or by section 2412 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The computation of such 2-year period shall not include any time during which an administrative proceeding under this subchapter was pending with respect to a complaint or charge under this subchapter based upon such discriminatory housing practice. This subparagraph does not apply to actions arising from a breach of a conciliation agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An aggrieved person may commence a civil action under this subsection whether or not a complaint has been filed under section 3610(a) of this title and without regard to the status of any such complaint, but if the Secretary or a State or local agency has obtained a conciliation agreement with the consent of an aggrieved person, no action may be filed under this subsection by such aggrieved person with respect to the alleged discriminatory housing practice which forms the basis for such complaint except for the purpose of enforcing the terms of such an agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An aggrieved person may not commence a civil action under this subsection with respect to an alleged discriminatory housing practice which forms the basis of a charge issued by the Secretary if an administrative law judge has commenced a hearing on the record under this subchapter with respect to such charge.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Relief which may be granted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, if the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may award to the plaintiff actual and punitive damages, and subject to subsection (d) of this section, may grant as relief, as the court deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order (including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice or ordering such affirmative action as may be appropriate).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee and costs. The United States shall be liable for such fees and costs to the same extent as a private person.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect on certain sales, encumbrances, and rentals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Relief granted under this section shall not affect any contract, sale, encumbrance, or lease consummated before the granting of such relief and involving a bona fide purchaser, encumbrancer, or tenant, without actual notice of the filing of a complaint with the Secretary or civil action under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Intervention by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon timely application, the Attorney General may intervene in such civil action, if the Attorney General certifies that the case is of general public importance.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in the past half decade, there have been major legislative and administrative changes in Federal fair housing and fair lending laws and substantial improvements in the Nation's understanding of discrimination in the housing markets;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in response to evidence of continuing housing discrimination, the Congress passed the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988 [probably should be the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&ndash;430, see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note set out under section 3601 of this title], to provide for more effective enforcement of fair housing rights through judicial and administrative avenues and to expand the number of protected classes covered under Federal fair housing laws;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 [Pub. L. 101&ndash;73, see Short Title of 1989 Amendment note set out under 12 U.S.C. 1811], the Congress expanded the disclosure provisions under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act [probably should be the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975; 12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] to provide increased information on the mortgage lending patterns of financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.], the Congress provided a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) in 1991, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act disclosed evidence of pervasive discrimination in the Nation's mortgage lending markets;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Housing Discrimination Survey, released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1991, found that Hispanic and African-American homeseekers experience some form of discrimination in at least half of their encounters with sales and rental agents;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the Fair Housing Initiatives Program should be revised and expanded to reflect the significant changes in the fair housing and fair lending area that have taken place since the Program's initial authorization in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 [Pub.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter or any other Act shall be construed to authorize any department, agency, officer, or employee of the United States to exercise any direction, supervision, or control over any police force or any other criminal justice agency of any State or any political subdivision thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Racial imbalance requirement restriction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to authorize the National Institute of Justice, the Bureau of Justice Statistics, or the Law Enforcement Assistance Administration&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to require, or condition the availability or amount of a grant upon the adoption by an applicant or grantee under this chapter of a percentage ratio, quota system, or other program to achieve racial balance in any criminal justice agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to deny or discontinue a grant because of the refusal of an applicant or grantee under this chapter to adopt such a ratio, system, or other program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Discrimination prohibited; notice of non-compliance; suspension and restoration of payments; hearing; civil action by Attorney General; private action, attorney fees, intervention by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No person in any State shall on the ground of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under or denied employment in connection with any programs or activity funded in whole or in part with funds made available under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Whenever there has been&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) receipt of notice of a finding, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, by a Federal court (other than in an action brought by the Attorney General) or State court, or by a Federal or State administrative agency, to the effect that there has been a pattern or practice of discrimination in violation of paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a determination after an investigation by the Office of Justice Programs (prior to a hearing under subparagraph (F) but including an opportunity for the State government or unit of local government to make a documentary submission regarding the allegation of discrimination with respect to such program or activity, with funds made available under this chapter) that a State government or unit of local government is not in compliance with paragraph (1);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Office of Justice Programs shall, within ten days after such occurrence, notify the chief executive of the affected State, or the State in which the affected unit of local government is located, and the chief executive of such unit of local government, that such program or activity has been so found or determined not to be in compliance with paragraph (1), and shall request <!-- PDFPage:3300 -->each chief executive, notified under this subparagraph with respect to such violation, to secure compliance. For purposes of clause (i) a finding by a Federal or State administrative agency shall be deemed rendered after notice and opportunity for a hearing if it is rendered pursuant to procedures consistent with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the event the chief executive secures compliance after notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), the terms and conditions with which the affected State government or unit of local government agrees to comply shall be set forth in writing and signed by the chief executive of the State, by the chief executive of such unit (in the event of a violation by a unit of local government), and by the Office of Justice Programs. On or prior to the effective date of the agreement, the Office of Justice Programs shall send a copy of the agreement to each complainant, if any, with respect to such violation. The chief executive of the State, or the chief executive of the unit (in the event of a violation by a unit of local government) shall file semiannual reports with the Office of Justice Programs detailing the steps taken to comply with the agreement. These reports shall cease to be filed upon the determination of the Office of Justice Programs that compliance has been secured, or upon the determination by a Federal or State court that such State government or local governmental unit is in compliance with this section. Within fifteen days of receipt of such reports, the Office of Justice Programs shall send a copy thereof to each such complainant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If, at the conclusion of ninety days after notification under subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) compliance has not been secured by the chief executive of that State or the chief executive of that unit of local government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) an administrative law judge has not made a determination under subparagraph (F) that it is likely the State government or unit of local government will prevail on the merits; the Office of Justice Programs shall notify the Attorney General that compliance has not been secured and caused to have suspended further payment of any funds under this chapter to that program or activity. Such suspension shall be limited to the specific program or activity cited by the Office of Justice Programs in the notice under subparagraph (A). Such suspension shall be effective for a period of not more than one hundred and twenty days, or, if there is a hearing under subparagraph (G), not more than thirty days after the conclusion of such hearing, unless there has been an express finding by the Office of Justice Programs, after notice and opportunity for such a hearing, that the recipient is not in compliance with paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Payment of the suspended funds shall resume only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such State government or unit of local government enters into a compliance agreement approved by the Office of Justice Programs and the Attorney General in accordance with subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) such State government or unit of local government complies fully with the final order or judgment of a Federal or State court, or by a Federal or State administrative agency if that order or judgment covers all the matters raised by the Office of Justice Programs in the notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), or is found to be in compliance with paragraph (1) by such court; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) after a hearing the Office of Justice Programs pursuant to subparagraph (F) finds that noncompliance has not been demonstrated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Whenever the Attorney General files a civil action alleging a pattern or practice of discriminatory conduct on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex in any program or activity of a State government or unit of local government which State government or unit of local government receives funds made available under this chapter, and the conduct allegedly violates the provisions of this section and neither party within forty-five days after such filing has been granted such preliminary relief with regard to the suspension or payment of funds as may be otherwise available by law, the Office of Justice Programs shall cause to have suspended further payment of any funds under this chapter to that specific program or activity alleged by the Attorney General to be in violation of the provisions of this subsection until such time as the court orders resumption of payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Prior to the suspension of funds under subparagraph (C), but within the ninety-day period after notification under subparagraph (C), the State government or unit of local government may request an expedited preliminary hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, in order to determine whether it is likely that the State government or unit of local government would, at a full hearing under subparagraph (G), prevail on the merits on the issue of the alleged noncompliance. A finding under this subparagraph by the administrative law judge in favor of the State government or unit of local government shall defer the suspension of funds under subparagraph (C) pending a finding of noncompliance at the conclusion of the hearing on the merits under subparagraph (G).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) At any time after notification under subparagraph (A), but before the conclusion of the one-hundred-and-twenty-day period referred to in subparagraph (C), a State government or unit of local government may request a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5, which the Office of Justice Programs shall initiate within sixty days of such request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Within thirty days after the conclusion of the hearing, or, in the absence of a hearing, at the conclusion of the one-hundred-and-twenty-day period referred to in subparagraph (C), the Office of Justice Programs shall make a finding of compliance or noncompliance. If the Office of Justice Programs makes a finding of noncompliance, the Office of Justice Programs shall notify the Attorney General in order that the Attorney General may institute a civil action under paragraph (3), cause to have terminated the payment of funds under this chapter, and, if appropriate, seek repayment of such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Office of Justice Programs makes a finding of compliance, payment of the suspended funds shall resume as provided in subparagraph (D).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3301 --><p class="statutory-body">(H) Any State government or unit of local government aggrieved by a final determination of the Office of Justice Programs under subparagraph (G) may appeal such determination as provided in section 3785 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever the Attorney General has reason to believe that a State government or unit of local government has engaged in or is engaging in a pattern or practice in violation of the provisions of this section, the Attorney General may bring a civil action in an appropriate United States district court. Such court may grant as relief any temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction, or other order, as necessary or appropriate to insure the full enjoyment of the rights described in this section, including the suspension, termination, or repayment of such funds made available under this chapter as the court may deem appropriate, or placing any further such funds in escrow pending the outcome of the litigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Whenever a State government or unit of local government, or any officer or employee thereof acting in an official capacity, has engaged or is engaging in any act or practice prohibited by this subsection, a civil action may be instituted after exhaustion of administrative remedies by the person aggrieved in an appropriate United States district court or in a State court of general jurisdiction. Administrative remedies shall be deemed to be exhausted upon the expiration of sixty days after the date the administrative complaint was filed with the Office of Justice Programs or any other administrative enforcement agency, unless within such period there has been a determination by the Office of Justice Programs or the agency on the merits of the complaint, in which case such remedies shall be deemed exhausted at the time the determination becomes final.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any civil action brought by a private person to enforce compliance with any provision of this subsection, the court may grant to a prevailing plaintiff reasonable attorney fees, unless the court determines that the lawsuit is frivolous, vexatious, brought for harassment purposes, or brought principally for the purpose of gaining attorney fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any action instituted under this section to enforce compliance with paragraph (1), the Attorney General, or a specially designated assistant for or in the name of the United States, may intervene upon timely application if he certifies that the action is of general public importance. In such action the United States shall be entitled to the same relief as if it had instituted the action.</p>
