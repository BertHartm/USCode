<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1310. Cooperative research or demonstration projects</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are hereby authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1957, $5,000,000 and for each fiscal year thereafter such sums as the Congress may determine for (A) making grants to States and public and other organizations and agencies for paying part of the cost of research or demonstration projects such as those relating to the prevention and reduction of dependency, or which will aid in effecting coordination of planning between private and public welfare agencies or which will help improve the administration and effectiveness of programs carried on or assisted under this chapter and programs related thereto, and (B) making contracts or jointly financed cooperative arrangements with States and public and other organizations and agencies for the conduct of research or demonstration projects relating to such matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No contract or jointly financed cooperative arrangement shall be entered into, and no grant shall be made, under paragraph (1), until the Secretary (or the Commissioner, with respect to any jointly financed cooperative agreement or grant concerning subchapters II or XVI of this chapter) obtains the advice and recommendations of specialists who are competent to evaluate the proposed projects as to soundness of their design, the possibilities of securing productive results, the adequacy of resources to conduct the proposed research or demonstrations, and their relationship to other similar research or demonstrations already completed or in process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Grants and payments under contracts or cooperative arrangements under paragraph (1) may be made either in advance or by way of reimbursement, as may be determined by the Secretary (or the Commissioner, with respect to any jointly financed cooperative agreement or grant concerning subchapter II or XVI of this chapter); and shall be made in such installments and on such conditions as the Secretary (or the Commissioner, as applicable) finds necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations and costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commissioner is authorized to waive any of the requirements, conditions, or limitations of subchapter XVI of this chapter (or to waive them only for specified purposes, or to impose additional requirements, conditions, or limitations) to such extent and for such period as the Commissioner finds necessary to carry out one or more experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects which, in the Commissioner's judgment, are likely to assist in promoting the objectives or facilitate the administration of such subchapter. Any costs for benefits under or administration of any such project (including planning for the project and the review and evaluation of the project and its results), in excess of those that would have been incurred without regard to the project, shall be met by the Commissioner from amounts available to the Commissioner for this purpose from appropriations made to carry out such subchapter. The costs of any such project which is carried out in coordination with one or more related projects under other subchapters of this chapter shall be allocated among the appropriations available for such projects and any Trust Funds involved, in a manner determined by the Commissioner with respect to the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance programs under subchapter II of this chapter and the supplemental security income program under subchapter XVI of this chapter, and by the Secretary with respect to other subchapters of this chapter, taking into consideration the programs (or types of benefit) to which the project (or part of a project) is most closely related or which the project (or part of a project) is intended to benefit. If, in order to carry out a project under this subsection, the Commissioner requests a State to make supplementary payments (or the Commissioner makes them pursuant to an agreement under section 1382e of this title) to individuals who are not eligible therefor, or in amounts or under circumstances in which the State does not make such payments, the Commissioner shall reimburse such State for the non-Federal share of such payments from amounts appropriated to carry out subchapter XVI of this chapter. If, in order to carry out a project under this subsection, the Secretary requests a State to provide medical assistance under its plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter to individuals who are not eligible therefor, or in amounts or under circumstances in which the State does not provide such medical assistance, the Secretary shall reimburse such State for the non-Federal share of such assistance from amounts appropriated to carry out subchapter XVI of this chapter, which shall be provided by the Commissioner to the Secretary for this purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to the participation of recipients of supplemental security income benefits in experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Commissioner is not authorized to carry out any project that would result in a substantial reduction in any individual's total income and resources as a result of his or her participation in the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Commissioner may not require any individual to participate in a project; and the Commissioner shall assure (i) that the voluntary participation of individuals in any project is obtained through informed written consent which satisfies the requirements for informed consent established by the Commissioner for use in any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project in which human subjects are at risk, and (ii) that any individual's voluntary agreement to participate in any project may be revoked by such individual at any time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Commissioner shall, to the extent feasible and appropriate, include recipients who are under age 18 as well as adult recipients; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Commissioner shall include in the projects carried out under this section such experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects as may be necessary to ascertain the feasibility of treating alcoholics and drug addicts to <!-- PDFPage:1788 -->prevent the onset of irreversible medical conditions which may result in permanent disability, including programs in residential care treatment centers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Survey of use of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to the amount otherwise appropriated in any other law to carry out subsection (a) of this section for fiscal year 2004, up to $8,500,000 is authorized and appropriated and shall be used by the Commissioner of Social Security under this subsection for purposes of conducting a statistically valid survey to determine how payments made to individuals, organizations, and State or local government agencies that are representative payees for benefits paid under subchapter II or XVI of this chapter are being managed and used on behalf of the beneficiaries for whom such benefits are paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 18 months after March 2, 2004, the Commissioner of Social Security shall submit a report on the survey conducted in accordance with paragraph (1) to the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Waiver of State plan requirements; costs regarded as State plan expenditures; availability of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project which, in the judgment of the Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of subchapter I, X, XIV, XVI, or XIX of this chapter, or part A or D of subchapter IV of this chapter, in a State or States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may waive compliance with any of the requirements of section 302, 602, 654, 1202, 1352, 1382, or 1396a of this title, as the case may be, to the extent and for the period he finds necessary to enable such State or States to carry out such project, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) costs of such project which would not otherwise be included as expenditures under section 303, 655, 1203, 1353, 1383, or 1396b of this title, as the case may be, and which are not included as part of the costs of projects under section 1310 of this title, shall, to the extent and for the period prescribed by the Secretary, be regarded as expenditures under the State plan or plans approved under such subchapter, or for administration of such State plan or plans, as may be appropriate, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) costs of such project which would not otherwise be a permissible use of funds under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter and which are not included as part of the costs of projects under section 1310 of this title, shall to the extent and for the period prescribed by the Secretary, be regarded as a permissible use of funds under such part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition, not to exceed $4,000,000 of the aggregate amount appropriated for payments to States under such subchapters for any fiscal year beginning after June 30, 1967, shall be available, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish, for payments to States to cover so much of the cost of such projects as is not covered by payments under such subchapters and is not included as part of the cost of projects for purposes of section 1310 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Child support enforcement programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project undertaken under subsection (a) of this section to assist in promoting the objectives of part D of subchapter IV of this chapter, the project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) must be designed to improve the financial well-being of children or otherwise improve the operation of the child support program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may not permit modifications in the child support program which would have the effect of disadvantaging children in need of support; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) must not result in increased cost to the Federal Government under part A of such subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Demonstration projects to test alternative definitions of unemployment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall enter into agreements with up to 8 States submitting applications under this subsection for the purpose of conducting demonstration projects in such States to test and evaluate the use, with respect to individuals who received aid under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter in the preceding month (on the basis of the unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner), of a number greater than 100 for the number of hours per month that such individuals may work and still be considered to be unemployed for purposes of section 607 of this title. If any State submits an application under this subsection for the purpose of conducting a demonstration project to test and evaluate the total elimination of the 100-hour rule, the Secretary shall approve at least one such application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If any State with an agreement under this subsection so requests, the demonstration project conducted pursuant to such agreement may test and evaluate the complete elimination of the 100-hour rule and of any other durational standard that might be applied in defining unemployment for purposes of determining eligibility under section 607 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding section 602(a)(1) of this title, a demonstration project conducted under this subsection may be conducted in one or more political subdivisions of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An agreement under this subsection shall be entered into between the Secretary and the State agency designated under section 602(a)(3) of this title. Such agreement shall provide for the payment of aid under the applicable State plan under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter as though section 607 of this title had been modified to reflect the definition of unemployment used in the demonstration project but shall also provide that such project shall otherwise be carried out in accordance with all of the requirements and conditions of section 607 of this title (and, except as provided in paragraph (2), any related requirements and conditions under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A demonstration project under this subsection may be commenced any time after September 30, 1990, and shall be conducted for such period of time as the agreement with the Secretary may provide; except that, in no event may a demonstration project under this section be conducted after September 30, 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Any State with an agreement under this subsection shall evaluate the comparative cost and employment effects of the use of the definition of unemployment in its demonstration project under this section by use of experimental and control groups comprised of a random sample of individuals receiving aid under section 607 of this title and shall furnish the Secretary with such information as the Secretary determines to be necessary to evaluate the results of the project conducted by the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall report the results of the demonstration projects conducted under this subsection to the Congress not later than 6 months after all such projects are completed.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1795 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1315_1_target" name="1315_1">1</a></sup> Extensions of State-wide comprehensive demonstration projects for which waivers granted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to the extension of any State-wide comprehensive demonstration project (in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;waiver project&rdquo;) for which a waiver of compliance with requirements of subchapter XIX of this chapter is granted under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the 6-month period ending 1 year before the date the waiver under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a waiver project would otherwise expire, the chief executive officer of the State which is operating the project may submit to the Secretary a written request for an extension, of up to 3 years, of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary fails to respond to the request within 6 months after the date it is submitted, the request is deemed to have been granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If such a request is granted, the deadline for submittal of a final report under the waiver project is deemed to have been extended until the date that is 1 year after the date the waiver project would otherwise have expired.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall release an evaluation of each such project not later than 1 year after the date of receipt of the final report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (7), the extension of a waiver project under this subsection shall be on the same terms and conditions (including applicable terms and conditions relating to quality and access of services, budget neutrality, data and reporting requirements, and special population protections) that applied to the project before its extension under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) If an original condition of approval of a waiver project was that Federal expenditures under the project not exceed the Federal expenditures that would otherwise have been made, the Secretary shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that, in the extension of the project under this subsection, such condition continues to be met. In applying the previous sentence, the Secretary shall take into account the Secretary's best estimate of rates of change in expenditures at the time of the extension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Application for extension of waiver project; submission; approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An application by the chief executive officer of a State for an extension of a waiver project the State is operating under an extension under subsection (e) of this section (in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;waiver project&rdquo;) shall be submitted and approved or disapproved in accordance with the following:</p>

A failure to provide such notification shall be deemed to be an approval of the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Not later than 45 days after the date a notification is made in accordance with paragraph (2), the Secretary shall inform the State of proposed changes in the terms and conditions of the waiver project.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) approve the application subject to such modifications in the terms and conditions&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) as have been agreed to by the Secretary and the State; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A failure by the Secretary to approve or disapprove an application submitted under this subsection in accordance with the requirements of subparagraph (A) shall be deemed to be an approval of the application subject to such modifications in the terms and conditions as have been agreed to (if any) by the Secretary and the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) An approval of an application for an extension of a waiver project under this subsection shall be for a period not to exceed 3 years.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The aggregate cost of operation and the aggregate volume of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The costs and volume of services for various functional accounts and subaccounts.</p>

In reporting under such a system, hospitals shall employ such chart of accounts, definitions, principles, and statistics as the Secretary may prescribe in order to reach a uniform reconciliation of financial and statistical data for specified uniform reports to be provided to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Monitoring, etc., of systems by Secretary</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1320a&ndash;1. Limitation on use of Federal funds for capital expenditures</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Use of reimbursement for planning activities for health services and facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to assure that Federal funds appropriated under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter are not used to support unnecessary capital expenditures made by or on behalf of health care facilities which are reimbursed under any of such subchapters and that, to the extent possible, reimbursement under such subchapters shall support planning activities with respect to health services and facilities in the various States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreement between Secretary and State for submission of proposed capital expenditures related to health care facilities and procedures for appeal from recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, after consultation with the Governor (or other chief executive officer) and with appropriate local public officials, shall make an agreement with any State which is able and willing to do so under which a designated planning agency (which shall be an agency described in clause (ii) of subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section that has a governing body or advisory board at least half of whose members represent consumer interests) will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make, and submit to the Secretary together with such supporting materials as he may find necessary, findings and recommendations with respect to capital expenditures proposed by or on behalf of any health care facility in such State within the field of its responsibilities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) receive from other agencies described in clause (ii) of subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section, and submit to the Secretary together with such supporting material as he may find necessary, the findings and recommendations of such other agencies with respect to capital expenditures proposed by or on behalf of health care facilities in such State within the fields of their respective responsibilities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establish and maintain procedures pursuant to which a person proposing any such capital expenditure may appeal a recommendation by the designated agency and will be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing by such agency or person other than the designated agency as the Governor (or other chief executive officer) may designate to hold such hearings,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whenever and to the extent that the findings of such designated agency or any such other agen<!-- PDFPage:1804 -->cy indicate that any such expenditure is not consistent with the standards, criteria, or plans developed pursuant to the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] to meet the need for adequate health care facilities in the area covered by the plan or plans so developed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Manner of payment to States for carrying out agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall pay any such State from the general fund in the Treasury, in advance or by way of reimbursement as may be provided in the agreement with it (and may make adjustments in such payments on account of overpayments or underpayments previously made), for the reasonable cost of performing the functions specified in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of amount of exclusions from Federal payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) neither the planning agency designated in the agreement described in subsection (b) of this section nor an agency described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph had been given notice of any proposed capital expenditure (in accordance with such procedure or in such detail as may be required by such agency) at least 60 days prior to obligation for such expenditure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the planning agency so designated or an agency so described had received such timely notice of the intention to make such capital expenditure and had, within a reasonable period after receiving such notice and prior to obligation for such expenditure, notified the person proposing such expenditure that the expenditure would not be in conformity with the standards, criteria, or plans developed by such agency or any other agency described in clause (ii) for adequate health care facilities in such State or in the area for which such other agency has responsibility, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the planning agency so designated had, prior to submitting to the Secretary the findings referred to in subsection (b) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) consulted with, and taken into consideration the findings and recommendations of, the State planning agencies established pursuant to sections 314(a) and 604(a) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 246(a), 291d(a)] (to the extent that either such agency is not the agency so designated) as well as the public or nonprofit private agency or organization responsible for the comprehensive regional, metropolitan area, or other local area plan or plans referred to in section 314(b) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 246(b)] and covering the area in which the health care facility proposing such capital expenditure is located (where such agency is not the agency designated in the agreement), or, if there is no such agency, such other public or nonprofit private agency or organization (if any) as performs, as determined in accordance with criteria included in regulations, similar functions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) granted to the person proposing such capital expenditure an opportunity for a fair hearing with respect to such findings;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, for such period as he finds necessary in any case to effectuate the purpose of this section, he shall, in determining the Federal payments to be made under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter with respect to services furnished in the health care facility for which such capital expenditure is made, not include any amount which is attributable to depreciation, interest on borrowed funds, a return on equity capital (in the case of proprietary facilities), or other expenses related to such capital expenditure. With respect to any organization which is reimbursed on a per capita or a fixed fee or negotiated rate basis, in determining the Federal payments to be made under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter, the Secretary shall exclude an amount which in his judgment is a reasonable equivalent to the amount which would otherwise be excluded under this subsection if payment were to be made on other than a per capita or a fixed fee or negotiated rate basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary, after submitting the matters involved to the advisory council established or designated under subsection (i) of this section, determines that an exclusion of expenses related to any capital expenditure of any health care facility would discourage the operation or expansion of such facility which has demonstrated to his satisfaction proof of capability to provide comprehensive health care services (including institutional services) efficiently, effectively, and economically, or would otherwise be inconsistent with the effective organization and delivery of health services or the effective administration of subchapter XVIII or XIX of this chapter, he shall not exclude such expenses pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of lease or comparable arrangement of any facility or equipment for a facility in determining amount of exclusions from Federal payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a person obtains under lease or comparable arrangement any facility or part thereof, or equipment for a facility, which would have been subject to an exclusion under subsection (d) of this section if the person had acquired it by purchase, the Secretary shall (1) in computing such person's rental expense in determining the Federal payments to be made under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter with respect to services furnished in such facility, deduct the amount which in his judgment is a reasonable equivalent of the amount that would have been excluded if the person had acquired such facility or such equipment by purchase, and (2) in computing such person's return on equity capital deduct any amount deposited under the terms of the lease or comparable arrangement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reconsideration by Secretary of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person dissatisfied with a determination by the Secretary under this section may within six months following notification of such determination request the Secretary to reconsider such determination. A determination by the Secretary under this section shall not be subject to administrative or judicial review.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1805 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Capital expenditure&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, a &ldquo;capital expenditure&rdquo; is an expenditure which, under generally accepted accounting principles, is not properly chargeable as an expense of operation and maintenance and which (1) exceeds $600,000 (or such lesser amount as the State may establish), (2) changes the bed capacity of the facility with respect to which such expenditure is made, or (3) substantially changes the services of the facility with respect to which such expenditure is made. For purposes of clause (1) of the preceding sentence, the cost of the studies, surveys, designs, plans, working drawings, specifications, and other activities essential to the acquisition, improvement, expansion, or replacement of the plant and equipment with respect to which such expenditure is made shall be included in determining whether such expenditure exceeds the dollar amount specified in clause (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Applicability to Christian Science sanatoriums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply to a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in section 1395x(ss)(1) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) National advisory council; establishment or designation of existing council; functions; consultations with other appropriate national advisory councils; composition; compensation and travel expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish a national advisory council, or designate an appropriate existing national advisory council, to advise and assist him in the preparation of general regulations to carry out the purposes of this section and on policy matters arising in the administration of this section, including the coordination of activities under this section with those under other parts of this chapter or under other Federal or federally assisted health programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall make appropriate provision for consultation between and coordination of the work of the advisory council established or designated under paragraph (1) and the Federal Hospital Council, the National Advisory Health Council, the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council, and other appropriate national advisory councils with respect to matters bearing on the purposes and administration of this section and the coordination of activities under this section with related Federal health programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an advisory council is established by the Secretary under paragraph (1), it shall be composed of members who are not otherwise in the regular full-time employ of the United States, and who shall be appointed by the Secretary without regard to the civil service laws from among leaders in the fields of the fundamental sciences, the medical sciences, and the organization, delivery, and financing of health care, and persons who are State or local officials or are active in community affairs or public or civic affairs or who are representative of minority groups. Members of such advisory council, while attending meetings of the council or otherwise serving on business of the council, shall be entitled to receive compensation at rates fixed by the Secretary, but not exceeding the maximum rate specified at the time of such service for grade GS&ndash;18 in section 5332 of title 5, including traveltime, and while away from their homes or regular places of business they may also be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of such title 5 for persons in the Government service employed intermittently.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Capital expenditure review exception for eligible organization health care facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A capital expenditure made by or on behalf of a health care facility shall not be subject to review pursuant to this section if 75 percent of the patients who can reasonably be expected to use the service with respect to which the capital expenditure is made will be individuals enrolled in an eligible organization as defined in section 1395mm(b) of this title, and if the Secretary determines that such capital expenditure is for services and facilities which are needed by such organization in order to operate efficiently and economically and which are not otherwise readily accessible to such organization because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the facilities do not provide common services at the same site (as usually provided by the organization),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the facilities are not available under a contract of reasonable duration,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) full and equal medical staff privileges in the facilities are not available,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) arrangements with such facilities are not administratively feasible, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the purchase of such services is more costly than if the organization provided the services directly.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) False statements or representations of material fact; proceedings to exclude; wrongful conversions by representative payees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person (including an organization, agency, or other entity) who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) makes, or causes to be made, a statement or representation of a material fact, for use in determining any initial or continuing right to or the amount of monthly insurance benefits under subchapter II of this chapter or benefits or payments under subchapter VIII or XVI of this chapter, that the person knows or should know is false or misleading,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) makes such a statement or representation for such use with knowing disregard for the truth, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) omits from a statement or representation for such use, or otherwise withholds disclosure of, a fact which the person knows or should know is material to the determination of any initial or continuing right to or the amount of monthly insurance benefits under <!-- PDFPage:1838 -->subchapter II of this chapter or benefits or payments under subchapter VIII or XVI of this chapter, if the person knows, or should know, that the statement or representation with such omission is false or misleading or that the withholding of such disclosure is misleading,</p>

In addition, the Commissioner of Social Security may make a determination in the same proceeding to recommend that the Secretary exclude, as provided in section 1320a&ndash;7 of this title, such a person who is a medical provider or physician from participation in the programs under subchapter XVIII of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this section, a material fact is one which the Commissioner of Social Security may consider in evaluating whether an applicant is entitled to benefits under subchapter II of this chapter or subchapter VIII of this chapter, or eligible for benefits or payments under subchapter XVI of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any person (including an organization, agency, or other entity) who, having received, while acting in the capacity of a representative payee pursuant to section 405(j), 1007, or 1383(a)(2) of this title, a payment under subchapter II, VIII, or XVI of this chapter for the use and benefit of another individual, converts such payment, or any part thereof, to a use that such person knows or should know is other than for the use and benefit of such other individual shall be subject to, in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, a civil money penalty of not more than $5,000 for each such conversion. Such person shall also be subject to an assessment, in lieu of damages sustained by the United States resulting from the conversion, of not more than twice the amount of any payments so converted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is against a person who has been convicted (whether upon a verdict after trial or upon a plea of guilty or nolo contendere) of a Federal or State crime; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) involves the same transaction as in the criminal action;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the person is estopped from denying the essential elements of the criminal offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The official conducting a hearing under this section may sanction a person, including any party or attorney, for failing to comply with an order or procedure, for failing to defend an action, or for such other misconduct as would interfere with the speedy, orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing. Such sanction shall reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct. Such sanction may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of refusal to provide or permit discovery, drawing negative factual inference or treating such refusal as an admission by deeming the matter, or certain facts, to be established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prohibiting a party from introducing certain evidence or otherwise supporting a particular claim or defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) striking pleadings, in whole or in part;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, and financial condition of the person committing the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person adversely affected by a determination of the Commissioner of Social Security under this section may obtain a review of such determination in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the person resides, or in which the statement or representation referred to in subsection (a) of this section <!-- PDFPage:1839 -->was made, by filing in such court (within 60 days following the date the person is notified of the Commissioner's determination) a written petition requesting that the determination be modified or set aside. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commissioner of Social Security, and thereupon the Commissioner of Social Security shall file in the court the record in the proceeding as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon such filing, the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have the power to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such record a decree affirming, modifying, remanding for further consideration, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the determination of the Commissioner of Social Security and enforcing the same to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified. No objection that has not been urged before the Commissioner of Social Security shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The findings of the Commissioner of Social Security with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive in the review described in paragraph (1). If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Commissioner of Social Security, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security and to be made a part of the record. The Commissioner of Social Security may modify such findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and the Commissioner's recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the Commissioner's original order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the filing of the record and the Commissioner's original or modified order with the court, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) by any combination of the foregoing.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;203, title IV, &sect;406, Mar. 2, 2004, 118 Stat. 527, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) [sic] GAO <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Mar. 2, 2004], the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a report to Congress regarding the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program established under section 1148 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&ndash;19) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) examines the annual and interim reports issued by States, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Advisory Panel established under section 101(f) of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999 [Pub. L. 106&ndash;170] (42 U.S.C. 1320b&ndash;19 note), and the Commissioner of Social Security regarding such program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) assesses the effectiveness of the activities carried out under such program; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) recommends such legislative or administrative changes as the Comptroller General determines are appropriate to improve the effectiveness of such program.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;170, &sect;2, Dec. 17, 1999, 113 Stat. 1862, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is the policy of the United States to provide assistance to individuals with disabilities to lead productive work lives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Health care is important to all Americans.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Health care is particularly important to individuals with disabilities and special health care needs who often cannot afford the insurance available to them through the private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the private sector, and are at great risk of incurring very high and economically devastating health care costs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Americans with significant disabilities often are unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage of the services and supports that enable them to live independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Personal assistance services (such as attendant services, personal assistance with transportation to and from work, reader services, job coaches, and related assistance) remove many of the barriers between significant disability and work. Coverage for such services, as well as for prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, and basic health care are powerful and proven tools for individuals with significant disabilities to obtain and retain employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing health care and related services is one of the greatest barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their employment, earning potential, and independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries risk losing medicare or medicaid coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of cash benefits associated with working.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Individuals with disabilities have greater opportunities for employment than ever before, aided by important public policy initiatives such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), advancements in public understanding of disability, and innovations in assistive technology, medical treatment, and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Despite such historic opportunities and the desire of millions of disability recipients to work and support themselves, fewer than one-half of one percent of Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries leave the disability rolls and return to work.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) In addition to the fear of loss of health care coverage, beneficiaries cite financial disincentives to work and earn income and lack of adequate employment training and placement services as barriers to employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Eliminating such barriers to work by creating financial incentives to work and by providing individuals with disabilities real choice in obtaining the services and technology they need to find, enter, and maintain employment can greatly improve their short and long-term financial independence and personal well-being.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In addition to the enormous advantages such changes promise for individuals with disabilities, redesigning government programs to help individuals with disabilities return to work may result in significant savings and extend the life of the Social Security Disability Insurance Trust Fund.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) If only an additional one-half of one percent of the current Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income recipients were to cease receiving benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social Security Trust Funds and to <!-- PDFPage:1880 -->the Treasury in cash assistance would total $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of such individuals, far exceeding the cost of providing incentives and services needed to assist them in entering work and achieving financial independence to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Tables for classification] are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) To provide health care and employment preparation and placement services to individuals with disabilities that will enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on cash benefit programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To encourage States to adopt the option of allowing individuals with disabilities to purchase medicaid coverage that is necessary to enable such individuals to maintain employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) To provide individuals with disabilities the option of maintaining medicare coverage while working.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To establish a return to work ticket program that will allow individuals with disabilities to seek the services necessary to obtain and retain employment and reduce their dependency on cash benefit programs.&rdquo;</p>
