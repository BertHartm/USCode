<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) youth who have become homeless or who leave and remain away from home without parental permission, are at risk of developing, and have a disproportionate share of, serious health, behavioral, and emotional problems because they lack sufficient resources to obtain care and may live on the street for extended periods thereby endangering themselves and creating a substantial law enforcement problem for communities in which they congregate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) many such young people, because of their age and situation, are urgently in need of temporary shelter and services, including services that are linguistically appropriate and acknowledge the environment of youth seeking these services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) services to such young people should be developed and provided using a positive youth development approach that ensures a young person a sense of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) safety and structure;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) belonging and membership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) self-worth and social contribution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) independence and control over one's life; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) closeness in interpersonal relationships.<sup><a href="#5701_1_target" name="5701_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in view of the interstate nature of the problem, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to develop an accurate national reporting system to report the problem, and to assist in the development of an effective system of care (including preventive and aftercare services, emergency shelter services, extended residential shelter, and street outreach services) outside the welfare system and the law enforcement system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to make a successful transition to adulthood, runaway youth, homeless youth, and other street youth need opportunities to complete high school or earn a general equivalency degree, learn job skills, and obtain employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) improved coordination and collaboration between the Federal programs that serve runaway and homeless youth are necessary for the development of a long-term strategy for responding to the needs of this population.</p>
