<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other Federal governmental programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section or any other provision of law, no payment shall be made to a State under this section for expenditures for child health assistance provided for a targeted low-income child under its plan to the extent that payment has been made or can reasonably be expected to be made promptly (as determined in accordance with regulations) under any other federally operated or financed health care insurance program, other than an insurance program operated or financed by the Indian Health Service, as identified by the Secretary.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In medicaid eligibility standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No payment may be made under subsection (a) of this section with respect to child health assistance provided under a State child health plan if the State adopts income and resource standards and methodologies for purposes of determining a child's eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan under subchapter XIX of this chapter that are more restrictive than those applied as of June 1, 1997.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) In amounts of payment expended for certain State-funded health insurance programs for children</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Flexibility in submittal of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or subsections (e) and (f) of section 1397dd of this title shall be con<!-- PDFPage:2707 -->strued as preventing a State from claiming as expenditures in the quarter expenditures that were incurred in a previous quarter.</p>
