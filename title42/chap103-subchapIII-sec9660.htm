<h4 class="note-head">Methamphetamine Remediation Research</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;143, Dec. 21, 2007, 121 Stat. 1809, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Methamphetamine Remediation Research Act of 2007&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Methamphetamine use and production is growing rapidly throughout the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Materials and residues remaining from the production of methamphetamine pose novel environ<!-- PDFPage:6817 -->mental problems in locations where methamphetamine laboratories have been closed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) There has been little standardization of measures for determining when the site of a closed methamphetamine laboratory has been successfully remediated.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Initial cleanup actions are generally limited to removal of hazardous substances and contaminated materials that pose an immediate threat to public health or the environment. It is not uncommon for significant levels of contamination to be found throughout residential structures after a methamphetamine laboratory has closed, partially because of a lack of knowledge of how to achieve an effective cleanup.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Data on methamphetamine laboratory-related contaminants of concern are very limited, and cleanup standards do not currently exist. In addition, procedures for sampling and analysis of contaminants need to be researched and developed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Many States are struggling with establishing remediation guidelines and programs to address the rapidly expanding number of methamphetamine laboratories being closed each year.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. VOLUNTARY GUIDELINES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of Voluntary Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than one year after the date of enactment of this Act [Dec. 21, 2007], the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Administrator&rsquo;), in consultation with the National Institute of Standards and Technology, shall establish voluntary guidelines, based on the best currently available scientific knowledge, for the remediation of former methamphetamine laboratories, including guidelines regarding preliminary site assessment and the remediation of residual contaminants.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Considerations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In developing the voluntary guidelines under subsection (a), the Administrator shall consider, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) relevant standards, guidelines, and requirements found in Federal, State, and local laws and regulations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the varying types and locations of former methamphetamine laboratories; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the expected cost of carrying out any proposed guidelines.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>States</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The voluntary guidelines should be designed to assist State and local governments in the development and the implementation of legislation and other policies to apply state-of-the-art knowledge and research results to the remediation of former methamphetamine laboratories. The Administrator shall work with State and local governments and other relevant non-Federal agencies and organizations, including through the conference described in section 5, to promote and encourage the appropriate adoption of the voluntary guidelines.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Updating the Guidelines</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall periodically update the voluntary guidelines as the Administrator, in consultation with States and other interested parties, determines to be necessary and appropriate to incorporate research findings and other new knowledge.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 4. RESEARCH PROGRAM.</h4>
