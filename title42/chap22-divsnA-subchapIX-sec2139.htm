<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exports inimical to common defense and security of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall not issue an export license under the authority of subsection (b) of this section if it is advised by the executive branch, in accordance with the procedures established under section 2155(a) of this title, that the export would be inimical to the common defense and security of the United States.</p>
