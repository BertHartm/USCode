<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Repealed. Pub. L. 101&ndash;549, title I, &sect;101(d)(1), Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2409.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) As soon as practicable, the Administrator shall, consistent with the purposes of this chapter and the Energy Supply and Environmental Coordination Act of 1974 [15 U.S.C. 791 et seq.], review each State's applicable implementation plans and report to the State on whether such plans can be revised in relation to fuel burning stationary sources (or persons supplying fuel to such sources) without interfering with the attainment and maintenance of any national ambient air quality standard within the period permitted in this section. If the Administrator determines that any such plan can be revised, he shall notify the State that a plan revision may be submitted by the State. Any plan revision which is submitted by the State shall, after pub<!-- PDFPage:6233 -->lic notice and opportunity for public hearing, be approved by the Administrator if the revision relates only to fuel burning stationary sources (or persons supplying fuel to such sources), and the plan as revised complies with paragraph (2) of this subsection. The Administrator shall approve or disapprove any revision no later than three months after its submission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Neither the State, in the case of a plan (or portion thereof) approved under this subsection, nor the Administrator, in the case of a plan (or portion thereof) promulgated under subsection (c) of this section, shall be required to revise an applicable implementation plan because one or more exemptions under section 7418 of this title (relating to Federal facilities), enforcement orders under section 7413(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7410_1_target" name="7410_1">1</a></sup> of this title, suspensions under subsection (f) or (g) of this section (relating to temporary energy or economic authority), orders under section 7419 of this title (relating to primary nonferrous smelters), or extensions of compliance in decrees entered under section 7413(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7410_1_target" name="7410_1">1</a></sup> of this title (relating to iron- and steel-producing operations) have been granted, if such plan would have met the requirements of this section if no such exemptions, orders, or extensions had been granted.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A)(i) Any State may include in a State implementation plan, but the Administrator may not require as a condition of approval of such plan under this section, any indirect source review program. The Administrator may approve and enforce, as part of an applicable implementation plan, an indirect source review program which the State chooses to adopt and submit as part of its plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no plan promulgated by the Administrator shall include any indirect source review program for any air quality control region, or portion thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Any State may revise an applicable implementation plan approved under this subsection to suspend or revoke any such program included in such plan, provided that such plan meets the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator shall have the authority to promulgate, implement and enforce regulations under subsection (c) of this section respecting indirect source review programs which apply only to federally assisted highways, airports, and other major federally assisted indirect sources and federally owned or operated indirect sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;indirect source&rdquo; means a facility, building, structure, installation, real property, road, or highway which attracts, or may attract, mobile sources of pollution. Such term includes parking lots, parking garages, and other facilities subject to any measure for management of parking supply (within the meaning of subsection (c)(2)(D)(ii) of this section), including regulation of existing off-street parking but such term does not include new or existing on-street parking. Direct emissions sources or facilities at, within, or associated with, any indirect source shall not be deemed indirect sources for the purpose of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph the term &ldquo;indirect source review program&rdquo; means the facility-by-facility review of indirect sources of air pollution, including such measures as are necessary to assure, or assist in assuring, that a new or modified indirect source will not attract mobile sources of air pollution, the emissions from which would cause or contribute to air pollution concentrations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) exceeding any national primary ambient air quality standard for a mobile source-related air pollutant after the primary standard attainment date, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) preventing maintenance of any such standard after such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (2)(B), the term &ldquo;transportation control measure&rdquo; does not include any measure which is an &ldquo;indirect source review program&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) No State plan shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this section unless such plan provides that in the case of any source which uses a supplemental, or intermittent control system for purposes of meeting the requirements of an order under section 7413(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7410_1_target" name="7410_1">1</a></sup> of this title or section 7419 of this title (relating to primary nonferrous smelter orders), the owner or operator of such source may not temporarily reduce the pay of any employee by reason of the use of such supplemental or intermittent or other dispersion dependent control system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Extension of period for submission of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may, wherever he determines necessary, extend the period for submission of any plan or portion thereof which implements a national secondary ambient air quality standard for a period not to exceed 18 months from the date otherwise required for submission of such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preparation and publication by Administrator of proposed regulations setting forth implementation plan; transportation regulations study and report; parking surcharge; suspension authority; plan implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall promulgate a Federal implementation plan at any time within 2 years after the Administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) finds that a State has failed to make a required submission or finds that the plan or plan revision submitted by the State does not satisfy the minimum criteria established under subsection (k)(1)(A) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) disapproves a State implementation plan submission in whole or in part,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless the State corrects the deficiency, and the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision, before the Administrator promulgates such Federal implementation plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) No parking surcharge regulation may be required by the Administrator under paragraph (1) of this subsection as a part of an applicable implementation plan. All parking surcharge regulations previously required by the Administrator shall be void upon June 22, 1974. This subparagraph shall not prevent the Administrator <!-- PDFPage:6234 -->from approving parking surcharges if they are adopted and submitted by a State as part of an applicable implementation plan. The Administrator may not condition approval of any implementation plan submitted by a State on such plan's including a parking surcharge regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Repealed. Pub. L. 101&ndash;549, title I, &sect;101(d)(3)(B), Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2409.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The term &ldquo;parking surcharge regulation&rdquo; means a regulation imposing or requiring the imposition of any tax, surcharge, fee, or other charge on parking spaces, or any other area used for the temporary storage of motor vehicles.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The term &ldquo;management of parking supply&rdquo; shall include any requirement providing that any new facility containing a given number of parking spaces shall receive a permit or other prior approval, issuance of which is to be conditioned on air quality considerations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The term &ldquo;preferential bus/carpool lane&rdquo; shall include any requirement for the setting aside of one or more lanes of a street or highway on a permanent or temporary basis for the exclusive use of buses or carpools, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E) No standard, plan, or requirement, relating to management of parking supply or preferential bus/carpool lanes shall be promulgated after June 22, 1974, by the Administrator pursuant to this section, unless such promulgation has been subjected to at least one public hearing which has been held in the area affected and for which reasonable notice has been given in such area. If substantial changes are made following public hearings, one or more additional hearings shall be held in such area after such notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon application of the chief executive officer of any general purpose unit of local government, if the Administrator determines that such unit has adequate authority under State or local law, the Administrator may delegate to such unit the authority to implement and enforce within the jurisdiction of such unit any part of a plan promulgated under this subsection. Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the Administrator from implementing or enforcing any applicable provision of a plan promulgated under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Repealed. Pub. L. 101&ndash;549, title I, &sect;101(d)(3)(C), Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2409.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Any measure in an applicable implementation plan which requires a toll or other charge for the use of a bridge located entirely within one city shall be eliminated from such plan by the Administrator upon application by the Governor of the State, which application shall include a certification by the Governor that he will revise such plan in accordance with subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of any applicable implementation plan with respect to which a measure has been eliminated under subparagraph (A), such plan shall, not later than one year after August 7, 1977, be revised to include comprehensive measures to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) establish, expand, or improve public transportation measures to meet basic transportation needs, as expeditiously as is practicable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) implement transportation control measures necessary to attain and maintain national ambient air quality standards,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and such revised plan shall, for the purpose of implementing such comprehensive public transportation measures, include requirements to use (insofar as is necessary) Federal grants, State or local funds, or any combination of such grants and funds as may be consistent with the terms of the legislation providing such grants and funds. Such measures shall, as a substitute for the tolls or charges eliminated under subparagraph (A), provide for emissions reductions equivalent to the reductions which may reasonably be expected to be achieved through the use of the tolls or charges eliminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any revision of an implementation plan for purposes of meeting the requirements of subparagraph (B) shall be submitted in coordination with any plan revision required under part D of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d), (e) Repealed. Pub. L. 101&ndash;549, title I, &sect;101(d)(4), (5), Nov. 15, 1990, 104 Stat. 2409</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National or regional energy emergencies; determination by President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon application by the owner or operator of a fuel burning stationary source, and after notice and opportunity for public hearing, the Governor of the State in which such source is located may petition the President to determine that a national or regional energy emergency exists of such severity that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a temporary suspension of any part of the applicable implementation plan or of any requirement under section 7651j of this title (concerning excess emissions penalties or offsets) may be necessary, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) other means of responding to the energy emergency may be inadequate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such determination shall not be delegable by the President to any other person. If the President determines that a national or regional energy emergency of such severity exists, a temporary emergency suspension of any part of an applicable implementation plan or of any requirement under section 7651j of this title (concerning excess emissions penalties or offsets) adopted by the State may be issued by the Governor of any State covered by the President's determination under the condition specified in paragraph (2) and may take effect immediately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A temporary emergency suspension under this subsection shall be issued to a source only if the Governor of such State finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there exists in the vicinity of such source a temporary energy emergency involving high levels of unemployment or loss of necessary energy supplies for residential dwellings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such unemployment or loss can be totally or partially alleviated by such emergency suspension.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Not more than one such suspension may be issued for any source on the basis of the same set of circumstances or on the basis of the same emergency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A temporary emergency suspension issued by a Governor under this subsection shall re<!-- PDFPage:6235 -->main in effect for a maximum of four months or such lesser period as may be specified in a disapproval order of the Administrator, if any. The Administrator may disapprove such suspension if he determines that it does not meet the requirements of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection shall not apply in the case of a plan provision or requirement promulgated by the Administrator under subsection (c) of this section, but in any such case the President may grant a temporary emergency suspension for a four month period of any such provision or requirement if he makes the determinations and findings specified in paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Governor may include in any temporary emergency suspension issued under this subsection a provision delaying for a period identical to the period of such suspension any compliance schedule (or increment of progress) to which such source is subject under section 1857c&ndash;10&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7410_2_target" name="7410_2">2</a></sup> of this title, as in effect before August 7, 1977, or section 7413(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7410_2_target" name="7410_2">2</a></sup> of this title, upon a finding that such source is unable to comply with such schedule (or increment) solely because of the conditions on the basis of which a suspension was issued under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Governor's authority to issue temporary emergency suspensions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any State which has adopted and submitted to the Administrator a proposed plan revision which the State determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) meets the requirements of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is necessary (i) to prevent the closing for one year or more of any source of air pollution, and (ii) to prevent substantial increases in unemployment which would result from such closing, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">which the Administrator has not approved or disapproved under this section within 12 months of submission of the proposed plan revision, the Governor may issue a temporary emergency suspension of the part of the applicable implementation plan for such State which is proposed to be revised with respect to such source. The determination under subparagraph (B) may not be made with respect to a source which would close without regard to whether or not the proposed plan revision is approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A temporary emergency suspension issued by a Governor under this subsection shall remain in effect for a maximum of four months or such lesser period as may be specified in a disapproval order of the Administrator. The Administrator may disapprove such suspension if he determines that it does not meet the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Governor may include in any temporary emergency suspension issued under this subsection a provision delaying for a period identical to the period of such suspension any compliance schedule (or increment of progress) to which such source is subject under section 1857c&ndash;10&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7410_2_target" name="7410_2">2</a></sup> of this title as in effect before August 7, 1977, or under section 7413(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7410_2_target" name="7410_2">2</a></sup> of this title upon a finding that such source is unable to comply with such schedule (or increment) solely because of the conditions on the basis of which a suspension was issued under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Publication of comprehensive document for each State setting forth requirements of applicable implementation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 5 years after November 15, 1990, and every 3 years thereafter, the Administrator shall assemble and publish a comprehensive document for each State setting forth all requirements of the applicable implementation plan for such State and shall publish notice in the Federal Register of the availability of such documents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may promulgate such regulations as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Modification of requirements prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except for a primary nonferrous smelter order under section 7419 of this title, a suspension under subsection (f) or (g) of this section (relating to emergency suspensions), an exemption under section 7418 of this title (relating to certain Federal facilities), an order under section 7413(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7410_2_target" name="7410_2">2</a></sup> of this title (relating to compliance orders), a plan promulgation under subsection (c) of this section, or a plan revision under subsection (a)(3) of this section; no order, suspension, plan revision, or other action modifying any requirement of an applicable implementation plan may be taken with respect to any stationary source by the State or by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Technological systems of continuous emission reduction on new or modified stationary sources; compliance with performance standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As a condition for issuance of any permit required under this subchapter, the owner or operator of each new or modified stationary source which is required to obtain such a permit must show to the satisfaction of the permitting authority that the technological system of continuous emission reduction which is to be used at such source will enable it to comply with the standards of performance which are to apply to such source and that the construction or modification and operation of such source will be in compliance with all other requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Environmental Protection Agency action on plan submissions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Completeness of plan submissions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Completeness criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 9 months after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall promulgate minimum criteria that any plan submission must meet before the Administrator is required to act on such submission under this subsection. The criteria shall be limited to the information necessary to enable the Administrator to determine whether the plan submission complies with the provisions of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Completeness finding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Within 60 days of the Administrator's receipt of a plan or plan revision, but no later than 6 months after the date, if any, by which a State is required to submit the plan or revision, the Administrator shall deter<!-- PDFPage:6236 -->mine whether the minimum criteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A) have been met. Any plan or plan revision that a State submits to the Administrator, and that has not been determined by the Administrator (by the date 6 months after receipt of the submission) to have failed to meet the minimum criteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A), shall on that date be deemed by operation of law to meet such minimum criteria.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Effect of finding of incompleteness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Administrator determines that a plan submission (or part thereof) does not meet the minimum criteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A), the State shall be treated as not having made the submission (or, in the Administrator's discretion, part thereof).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Deadline for action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 12 months of a determination by the Administrator (or a determination deemed by operation of law) under paragraph (1) that a State has submitted a plan or plan revision (or, in the Administrator's discretion, part thereof) that meets the minimum criteria established pursuant to paragraph (1), if applicable (or, if those criteria are not applicable, within 12 months of submission of the plan or revision), the Administrator shall act on the submission in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Full and partial approval and disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any submittal on which the Administrator is required to act under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall approve such submittal as a whole if it meets all of the applicable requirements of this chapter. If a portion of the plan revision meets all the applicable requirements of this chapter, the Administrator may approve the plan revision in part and disapprove the plan revision in part. The plan revision shall not be treated as meeting the requirements of this chapter until the Administrator approves the entire plan revision as complying with the applicable requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Conditional approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may approve a plan revision based on a commitment of the State to adopt specific enforceable measures by a date certain, but not later than 1 year after the date of approval of the plan revision. Any such conditional approval shall be treated as a disapproval if the State fails to comply with such commitment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Calls for plan revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Administrator finds that the applicable implementation plan for any area is substantially inadequate to attain or maintain the relevant national ambient air quality standard, to mitigate adequately the interstate pollutant transport described in section 7506a of this title or section 7511c of this title, or to otherwise comply with any requirement of this chapter, the Administrator shall require the State to revise the plan as necessary to correct such inadequacies. The Administrator shall notify the State of the inadequacies, and may establish reasonable deadlines (not to exceed 18 months after the date of such notice) for the submission of such plan revisions. Such findings and notice shall be public. Any finding under this paragraph shall, to the extent the Administrator deems appropriate, subject the State to the requirements of this chapter to which the State was subject when it developed and submitted the plan for which such finding was made, except that the Administrator may adjust any dates applicable under such requirements as appropriate (except that the Administrator may not adjust any attainment date prescribed under part D of this subchapter, unless such date has elapsed).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Corrections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Administrator determines that the Administrator's action approving, disapproving, or promulgating any plan or plan revision (or part thereof), area designation, redesignation, classification, or reclassification was in error, the Administrator may in the same manner as the approval, disapproval, or promulgation revise such action as appropriate without requiring any further submission from the State. Such determination and the basis thereof shall be provided to the State and public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Plan revisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each revision to an implementation plan submitted by a State under this chapter shall be adopted by such State after reasonable notice and public hearing. The Administrator shall not approve a revision of a plan if the revision would interfere with any applicable requirement concerning attainment and reasonable further progress (as defined in section 7501 of this title), or any other applicable requirement of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may apply any of the sanctions listed in section 7509(b) of this title at any time (or at any time after) the Administrator makes a finding, disapproval, or determination under paragraphs (1) through (4), respectively, of section 7509(a) of this title in relation to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by the Administrator) required under this chapter, with respect to any portion of the State the Administrator determines reasonable and appropriate, for the purpose of ensuring that the requirements of this chapter relating to such plan or plan item are met. The Administrator shall, by rule, establish criteria for exercising his authority under the previous sentence with respect to any deficiency referred to in section 7509(a) of this title to ensure that, during the 24-month period following the finding, disapproval, or determination referred to in section 7509(a) of this title, such sanctions are not applied on a statewide basis where one or more political subdivisions covered by the applicable implementation plan are principally responsible for such deficiency.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an Indian tribe submits an implementation plan to the Administrator pursuant to section 7601(d) of this title, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with the provisions for review set forth in this section for State plans, except as otherwise provided by regulation promulgated pursuant to section 7601(d)(2) of this title. When such plan becomes effective in accordance with the regulations promulgated under section 7601(d) of this title, the plan shall become applicable to all areas (except as expressly provided otherwise in the plan) located within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent and including rights-of-way running through the reservation.</p>
