<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In making payments under a grant under paragraph (1) for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate to each State with an application approved under this section an additional amount which bears the same ratio to the amount appropriated to carry out this section for that fiscal year and remaining after amounts are made available under subparagraph (A) as the number of pharmacies of the State bears to the number of pharmacies of all States with applications approved under this section (as determined by the Secretary), except that the Secretary may adjust the amount allocated to a State under this subparagraph after taking into consideration the budget cost estimate for the State's controlled substance monitoring program.</p>
