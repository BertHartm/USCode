<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Commissioner shall comply with such request, except to the extent that compliance with such request would constitute a violation of the terms of any contract entered into under section 405(r) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Public inspection</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) There are hereby authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1957, $5,000,000 and for each fiscal year thereafter such sums as the Congress may determine for (A) making grants to States and public and other organizations and agencies for paying part of the cost of research or demonstration projects such as those relating to the prevention and reduction of dependency, or which will aid in effecting coordination of planning between private and public welfare agencies or which will help improve the administration and effectiveness of programs carried on or assisted under this chapter and programs related thereto, and (B) making contracts or jointly financed cooperative arrangements with States and public and other organizations and agencies for the conduct of research or demonstration projects relating to such matters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No contract or jointly financed cooperative arrangement shall be entered into, and no grant shall be made, under paragraph (1), until the Secretary (or the Commissioner, with respect to any jointly financed cooperative agreement or grant concerning subchapters II or XVI of this chapter) obtains the advice and recommendations of specialists who are competent to evaluate the proposed projects as to soundness of their design, the possibilities of securing productive results, the adequacy of resources to conduct the proposed research or demonstrations, and their relationship to other similar research or demonstrations already completed or in process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Grants and payments under contracts or cooperative arrangements under paragraph (1) may be made either in advance or by way of reimbursement, as may be determined by the Secretary (or the Commissioner, with respect to any jointly financed cooperative agreement or grant concerning subchapter XVI of this chapter); and shall be made in such installments and on such conditions as the Secretary (or the Commissioner, as applicable) finds necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Commissioner is authorized to waive any of the requirements, conditions, or limitations of subchapter XVI of this chapter (or to waive them only for specified purposes, or to impose additional requirements, conditions, or limitations) to such extent and for such period as the Commissioner finds necessary to carry out one or more experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects which, in the Commissioner's judgment, are likely to assist in promoting the objectives or facilitate the administration of such subchapter. Any costs for benefits under or administration of any such project (including planning for the project and the review and evaluation of the project and its results), in excess of those that would have been incurred without regard to the project, shall be met by the Commissioner from amounts available to the Commissioner for this purpose from appropriations made to carry out such subchapter. The costs of any such project which is carried out in coordination with one or more related projects under other subchapters of this chapter shall be allocated among the appropriations available for such projects and any Trust Funds involved, in a manner determined by the Commissioner with respect to the old-age, survivors, and disability insurance programs under subchapter II of this chapter and the supplemental security income program under subchapter XVI of this chapter, and by the Secretary with respect to other subchapters of this chapter, taking into consideration the programs (or types of benefit) to which the project (or part of a project) is most closely related or which the project (or part of a project) is intended to benefit. If, in order to carry out a project under this subsection, the Commissioner requests a State to make supplementary payments (or the Commissioner makes them pursuant to an agreement under section 1382e of this title) to individuals who are not eligible therefor, or in amounts or under circumstances in which the State does not make such payments, the Commissioner shall reimburse such State for the non-Federal share of such payments from amounts appropriated to carry out subchapter XVI of this chapter. If, in order to carry out a project under this subsection, the Secretary requests a State to provide medical assistance under its plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter to individuals who are not eligible therefor, or in amounts or under circumstances in which the State does not provide such medical assistance, the Secretary shall reimburse such State for the non-Federal share of such assistance from amounts appropriated to carry out subchapter XVI of this chapter, which shall be provided by the Commissioner to the Secretary for this purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to the participation of recipients of supplemental security income benefits in experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects under this subsection&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Commissioner may not require any individual to participate in a project; and the Commissioner shall assure (i) that the voluntary participation of individuals in any <!-- PDFPage:1485 -->project is obtained through informed written consent which satisfies the requirements for informed consent established by the Commissioner for use in any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project in which human subjects are at risk, and (ii) that any individual's voluntary agreement to participate in any project may be revoked by such individual at any time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Commissioner shall, to the extent feasible and appropriate, include recipients who are under age 18 as well as adult recipients; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Commissioner shall include in the projects carried out under this section such experimental, pilot, or demonstration projects as may be necessary to ascertain the feasibility of treating alcoholics and drug addicts to prevent the onset of irreversible medical conditions which may result in permanent disability, including programs in residential care treatment centers.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Waiver of State plan requirements; costs regarded as State plan expenditures; availability of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project which, in the judgment of the Secretary, is likely to assist in promoting the objectives of subchapter I, X, XIV, XVI, or XIX of this chapter, or part A or D of subchapter IV of this chapter, in a State or States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may waive compliance with any of the requirements of section 302, 602, 654, 1202, 1352, 1382, or 1396a of this title, as <!-- PDFPage:1491 -->the case may be, to the extent and for the period he finds necessary to enable such State or States to carry out such project, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) costs of such project which would not otherwise be included as expenditures under section 303, 655, 1203, 1353, 1383, or 1396b of this title, as the case may be, and which are not included as part of the costs of projects under section 1310 of this title, shall, to the extent and for the period prescribed by the Secretary, be regarded as expenditures under the State plan or plans approved under such subchapter, or for administration of such State plan or plans, as may be appropriate, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) costs of such project which would not otherwise be a permissible use of funds under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter and which are not included as part of the costs of projects under section 1310 of this title, shall to the extent and for the period prescribed by the Secretary, be regarded as a permissible use of funds under such part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In addition, not to exceed $4,000,000 of the aggregate amount appropriated for payments to States under such subchapters for any fiscal year beginning after June 30, 1967, shall be available, under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may establish, for payments to States to cover so much of the cost of such projects as is not covered by payments under such subchapters and is not included as part of the cost of projects for purposes of section 1310 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Child support enforcement programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any experimental, pilot, or demonstration project undertaken under subsection (a) of this section to assist in promoting the objectives of part D of subchapter IV of this chapter, the project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) must be designed to improve the financial well-being of children or otherwise improve the operation of the child support program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may not permit modifications in the child support program which would have the effect of disadvantaging children in need of support; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) must not result in increased cost to the Federal Government under part A of such subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Demonstration projects to test alternative definitions of unemployment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall enter into agreements with up to 8 States submitting applications under this subsection for the purpose of conducting demonstration projects in such States to test and evaluate the use, with respect to individuals who received aid under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter in the preceding month (on the basis of the unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner), of a number greater than 100 for the number of hours per month that such individuals may work and still be considered to be unemployed for purposes of section 607 of this title. If any State submits an application under this subsection for the purpose of conducting a demonstration project to test and evaluate the total elimination of the 100-hour rule, the Secretary shall approve at least one such application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If any State with an agreement under this subsection so requests, the demonstration project conducted pursuant to such agreement may test and evaluate the complete elimination of the 100-hour rule and of any other durational standard that might be applied in defining unemployment for purposes of determining eligibility under section 607 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding section 602(a)(1) of this title, a demonstration project conducted under this subsection may be conducted in one or more political subdivisions of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An agreement under this subsection shall be entered into between the Secretary and the State agency designated under section 602(a)(3) of this title. Such agreement shall provide for the payment of aid under the applicable State plan under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter as though section 607 of this title had been modified to reflect the definition of unemployment used in the demonstration project but shall also provide that such project shall otherwise be carried out in accordance with all of the requirements and conditions of section 607 of this title (and, except as provided in paragraph (2), any related requirements and conditions under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A demonstration project under this subsection may be commenced any time after September 30, 1990, and shall be conducted for such period of time as the agreement with the Secretary may provide; except that, in no event may a demonstration project under this section be conducted after September 30, 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Any State with an agreement under this subsection shall evaluate the comparative cost and employment effects of the use of the definition of unemployment in its demonstration project under this section by use of experimental and control groups comprised of a random sample of individuals receiving aid under section 607 of this title and shall furnish the Secretary with such information as the Secretary determines to be necessary to evaluate the results of the project conducted by the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall report the results of the demonstration projects conducted under this subsection to the Congress not later than 6 months after all such projects are completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1315_1_target" name="1315_1">1</a></sup> Extensions of State-wide comprehensive demonstration projects for which waivers granted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this subsection shall apply to the extension of any State-wide comprehensive demonstration project (in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;waiver project&rdquo;) for which a waiver of compliance with requirements of subchapter XIX of this chapter is granted under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) During the 6-month period ending 1 year before the date the waiver under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a waiver project would otherwise expire, the chief executive officer of the State which is operating the project may submit to the Secretary a written request for an extension, of up to 3 years, of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary fails to respond to the request within 6 months after the date it is sub<!-- PDFPage:1492 -->mitted, the request is deemed to have been granted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If such a request is granted, the deadline for submittal of a final report under the waiver project is deemed to have been extended until the date that is 1 year after the date the waiver project would otherwise have expired.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall release an evaluation of each such project not later than 1 year after the date of receipt of the final report.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Subject to paragraphs (4) and (7), the extension of a waiver project under this subsection shall be on the same terms and conditions (including applicable terms and conditions relating to quality and access of services, budget neutrality, data and reporting requirements, and special population protections) that applied to the project before its extension under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) If an original condition of approval of a waiver project was that Federal expenditures under the project not exceed the Federal expenditures that would otherwise have been made, the Secretary shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that, in the extension of the project under this subsection, such condition continues to be met. In applying the previous sentence, the Secretary shall take into account the Secretary's best estimate of rates of change in expenditures at the time of the extension.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment; criteria for regulations; requirements for hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of reporting the cost of services provided by, of planning, and of measuring and comparing the efficiency of and effective use of services in, hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, intermediate care facilities, home health agencies, health maintenance organizations, and other types of health services facilities and organizations to which payment may be made under this chapter, the Secretary shall establish by regulation, for each such type of health services facility or organization, a uniform system for the reporting by a facility or organization of that type of the following information:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The aggregate cost of operation and the aggregate volume of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The costs and volume of services for various functional accounts and subaccounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Rates, by category of patient and class of purchaser.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Capital assets, as defined by the Secretary, including (as appropriate) capital funds, debt service, lease agreements used in lieu of capital funds, and the value of land, facilities, and equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Discharge and bill data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The uniform reporting system for a type of health services facility or organization shall provide for appropriate variation in the application of the system to different classes of facilities or organizations within that type and shall be established, to the extent practicable, consistent with the cooperative system for producing comparable and uniform health information and statistics described in section 242k(e)(1) of this title. In reporting under such a system, hospitals shall employ such chart of accounts, definitions, principles, and statistics as the Secretary may prescribe in order to reach a uniform reconciliation of financial and statistical data for specified uniform reports to be provided to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Monitoring, etc., of systems by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) monitor the operation of the systems established under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) assist with and support demonstrations and evaluations of the effectiveness and cost of the operation of such systems and encourage State adoption of such systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) periodically revise such systems to improve their effectiveness and diminish their cost.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Availability of information to appropriate agencies and organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide information obtained through use of the uniform reporting systems described in subsection (a) of this section in a useful manner and format to appropriate agencies and organizations, including health systems agencies (designated under section 300<em>l</em>&ndash;4&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1320a_1_target" name="1320a_1">1</a></sup> of this title) and State health planning and development agencies (designated under section 300m&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1320a_1_target" name="1320a_1">1</a></sup> of this title), as may be necessary to carry out such agencies&rsquo; and organizations&rsquo; functions.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1320a&ndash;1. Limitation on use of Federal funds for capital expenditures</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Use of reimbursement for planning activities for health services and facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to assure that Federal funds appropriated under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter are not used to support unnecessary capital expenditures made by or on behalf of health care facilities which are reimbursed under any of such subchapters and that, to the extent possible, reimbursement under such subchapters shall support planning activities with respect to health services and facilities in the various States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreement between Secretary and State for submission of proposed capital expenditures related to health care facilities and procedures for appeal from recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, after consultation with the Governor (or other chief executive officer) and <!-- PDFPage:1500 -->with appropriate local public officials, shall make an agreement with any State which is able and willing to do so under which a designated planning agency (which shall be an agency described in clause (ii) of subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section that has a governing body or advisory board at least half of whose members represent consumer interests) will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make, and submit to the Secretary together with such supporting materials as he may find necessary, findings and recommendations with respect to capital expenditures proposed by or on behalf of any health care facility in such State within the field of its responsibilities,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) receive from other agencies described in clause (ii) of subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section, and submit to the Secretary together with such supporting material as he may find necessary, the findings and recommendations of such other agencies with respect to capital expenditures proposed by or on behalf of health care facilities in such State within the fields of their respective responsibilities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) establish and maintain procedures pursuant to which a person proposing any such capital expenditure may appeal a recommendation by the designated agency and will be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing by such agency or person other than the designated agency as the Governor (or other chief executive officer) may designate to hold such hearings,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whenever and to the extent that the findings of such designated agency or any such other agency indicate that any such expenditure is not consistent with the standards, criteria, or plans developed pursuant to the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] to meet the need for adequate health care facilities in the area covered by the plan or plans so developed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Manner of payment to States for carrying out agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall pay any such State from the general fund in the Treasury, in advance or by way of reimbursement as may be provided in the agreement with it (and may make adjustments in such payments on account of overpayments or underpayments previously made), for the reasonable cost of performing the functions specified in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination of amount of exclusions from Federal payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) neither the planning agency designated in the agreement described in subsection (b) of this section nor an agency described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (B) of this paragraph had been given notice of any proposed capital expenditure (in accordance with such procedure or in such detail as may be required by such agency) at least 60 days prior to obligation for such expenditure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the planning agency so designated or an agency so described had received such timely notice of the intention to make such capital expenditure and had, within a reasonable period after receiving such notice and prior to obligation for such expenditure, notified the person proposing such expenditure that the expenditure would not be in conformity with the standards, criteria, or plans developed by such agency or any other agency described in clause (ii) for adequate health care facilities in such State or in the area for which such other agency has responsibility, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the planning agency so designated had, prior to submitting to the Secretary the findings referred to in subsection (b) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) consulted with, and taken into consideration the findings and recommendations of, the State planning agencies established pursuant to sections 314(a) and 604(a) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 246(a), 291d(a)] (to the extent that either such agency is not the agency so designated) as well as the public or nonprofit private agency or organization responsible for the comprehensive regional, metropolitan area, or other local area plan or plans referred to in section 314(b) of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 246(b)] and covering the area in which the health care facility proposing such capital expenditure is located (where such agency is not the agency designated in the agreement), or, if there is no such agency, such other public or nonprofit private agency or organization (if any) as performs, as determined in accordance with criteria included in regulations, similar functions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) granted to the person proposing such capital expenditure an opportunity for a fair hearing with respect to such findings;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then, for such period as he finds necessary in any case to effectuate the purpose of this section, he shall, in determining the Federal payments to be made under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter with respect to services furnished in the health care facility for which such capital expenditure is made, not include any amount which is attributable to depreciation, interest on borrowed funds, a return on equity capital (in the case of proprietary facilities), or other expenses related to such capital expenditure. With respect to any organization which is reimbursed on a per capita or a fixed fee or negotiated rate basis, in determining the Federal payments to be made under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter, the Secretary shall exclude an amount which in his judgment is a reasonable equivalent to the amount which would otherwise be excluded under this subsection if payment were to be made on other than a per capita or a fixed fee or negotiated rate basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary, after submitting the matters involved to the advisory council established or designated under subsection (i) of this section, determines that an exclusion of expenses related to any capital expenditure of any health care facility would discourage the operation or expansion of such facility which has demonstrated to his satisfaction proof of capability to provide comprehensive health care services (including institutional services) efficiently, effectively, and economically, or would otherwise be inconsistent with the effective organization and delivery of health services or the effective <!-- PDFPage:1501 -->administration of subchapter XVIII or XIX of this chapter, he shall not exclude such expenses pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of lease or comparable arrangement of any facility or equipment for a facility in determining amount of exclusions from Federal payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a person obtains under lease or comparable arrangement any facility or part thereof, or equipment for a facility, which would have been subject to an exclusion under subsection (d) of this section if the person had acquired it by purchase, the Secretary shall (1) in computing such person's rental expense in determining the Federal payments to be made under subchapters XVIII and XIX of this chapter with respect to services furnished in such facility, deduct the amount which in his judgment is a reasonable equivalent of the amount that would have been excluded if the person had acquired such facility or such equipment by purchase, and (2) in computing such person's return on equity capital deduct any amount deposited under the terms of the lease or comparable arrangement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reconsideration by Secretary of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person dissatisfied with a determination by the Secretary under this section may within six months following notification of such determination request the Secretary to reconsider such determination. A determination by the Secretary under this section shall not be subject to administrative or judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Capital expenditure&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, a &ldquo;capital expenditure&rdquo; is an expenditure which, under generally accepted accounting principles, is not properly chargeable as an expense of operation and maintenance and which (1) exceeds $600,000 (or such lesser amount as the State may establish), (2) changes the bed capacity of the facility with respect to which such expenditure is made, or (3) substantially changes the services of the facility with respect to which such expenditure is made. For purposes of clause (1) of the preceding sentence, the cost of the studies, surveys, designs, plans, working drawings, specifications, and other activities essential to the acquisition, improvement, expansion, or replacement of the plant and equipment with respect to which such expenditure is made shall be included in determining whether such expenditure exceeds the dollar amount specified in clause (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Applicability to Christian Science sanatoriums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply to a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in section 1395x(ss)(1) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) National advisory council; establishment or designation of existing council; functions; consultations with other appropriate national advisory councils; composition; compensation and travel expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish a national advisory council, or designate an appropriate existing national advisory council, to advise and assist him in the preparation of general regulations to carry out the purposes of this section and on policy matters arising in the administration of this section, including the coordination of activities under this section with those under other parts of this chapter or under other Federal or federally assisted health programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall make appropriate provision for consultation between and coordination of the work of the advisory council established or designated under paragraph (1) and the Federal Hospital Council, the National Advisory Health Council, the Health Insurance Benefits Advisory Council, and other appropriate national advisory councils with respect to matters bearing on the purposes and administration of this section and the coordination of activities under this section with related Federal health programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an advisory council is established by the Secretary under paragraph (1), it shall be composed of members who are not otherwise in the regular full-time employ of the United States, and who shall be appointed by the Secretary without regard to the civil service laws from among leaders in the fields of the fundamental sciences, the medical sciences, and the organization, delivery, and financing of health care, and persons who are State or local officials or are active in community affairs or public or civic affairs or who are representative of minority groups. Members of such advisory council, while attending meetings of the council or otherwise serving on business of the council, shall be entitled to receive compensation at rates fixed by the Secretary, but not exceeding the maximum rate specified at the time of such service for grade GS&ndash;18 in section 5332 of title 5, including traveltime, and while away from their homes or regular places of business they may also be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by section 5703 of such title 5 for persons in the Government service employed intermittently.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Capital expenditure review exception for eligible organization health care facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A capital expenditure made by or on behalf of a health care facility shall not be subject to review pursuant to this section if 75 percent of the patients who can reasonably be expected to use the service with respect to which the capital expenditure is made will be individuals enrolled in an eligible organization as defined in section 1395mm(b) of this title, and if the Secretary determines that such capital expenditure is for services and facilities which are needed by such organization in order to operate efficiently and economically and which are not otherwise readily accessible to such organization because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the facilities do not provide common services at the same site (as usually provided by the organization),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the facilities are not available under a contract of reasonable duration,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) full and equal medical staff privileges in the facilities are not available,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) arrangements with such facilities are not administratively feasible, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the purchase of such services is more costly than if the organization provided the services directly.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the person is estopped from denying the essential elements of the criminal offense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The official conducting a hearing under this section may sanction a person, including any party or attorney, for failing to comply with an order or procedure, for failing to defend an action, or for such other misconduct as would interfere with the speedy, orderly, or fair conduct of the hearing. Such sanction shall reasonably relate to the severity and nature of the failure or misconduct. Such sanction may include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses, and financial condition of the person committing the offense; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person adversely affected by a determination of the Commissioner of Social Security under this section may obtain a review of such determination in the United States Court of Appeals for the circuit in which the person resides, or in which the statement or representation referred to in subsection (a) of this section was made, by filing in such court (within 60 days following the date the person is notified of the Commissioner's determination) a written petition requesting that the determination be modified or set aside. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Commissioner of Social Security, and thereupon the Commissioner of Social Security shall file in the court the record in the proceeding as provided in section 2112 of title 28. Upon such filing, the court shall have jurisdiction of the proceeding and of the question determined therein, and shall have the power to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such record a decree affirming, modifying, remanding for further consideration, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the determination of the Commissioner of Social Security and enforcing the same to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified. No objection that has not been urged before the Commissioner of Social Security shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The findings of the Commissioner of Social Security with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive in the review described in paragraph (1). If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Commissioner of Social Security, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Commissioner of Social Security and to be made a part of the record. The Commissioner of Social Security may modify such findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall file with the court such modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole shall be conclusive, and the Commissioner's recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of the Commissioner's original order.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1534 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the filing of the record and the Commissioner's original or modified order with the court, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States, as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) by any combination of the foregoing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment and consolidation of geographic areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish throughout the United States geographic areas with respect to which contracts under this part will be made. In establishing such areas, the Secretary shall use the same areas as established under section 1320c&ndash;1 of this title as in effect immediately prior to September 3, 1982, but subject to the provisions of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As soon as practicable after September 3, 1982, the Secretary shall consolidate such geographic areas, taking into account the following criteria:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each State shall generally be designated as a geographic area for purposes of paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary shall establish local or regional areas rather than State areas only where the volume of review activity or other relevant factors (as determined by the Secretary) warrant such an establishment, and the Secretary determines that review activity can be carried out with equal or greater efficiency by establishing such local or regional areas. In applying this subparagraph the Secretary shall take into account the number of hospital admissions within each State for which payment may be made under subchapter XVIII of this chapter or a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter, with any State having fewer than 180,000 such admissions annually being established as a single statewide area, and no local or regional area being established which has fewer than 60,000 total hospital admissions (including public and private pay patients) under review annually, unless the Secretary determines that other relevant factors warrant otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) No local or regional area shall be designated which is not a self-contained medical service area, having a full spectrum of services, including medical specialists&rsquo; services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Organizations entitled to contract with Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall enter into a contract with a utilization and quality control peer review organization for each area established under subsection (a) of this section if a qualified organization is available in such area and such organization and the Secretary have negotiated a proposed contract which the Secretary determines will be carried out by such organization in a manner consistent with the efficient and effective administration of this part. If more than one such qualified organization meets the requirements of the preceding sentence, priority shall be given to any such organization which is described in section 1320c&ndash;1(1)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Prior to November 15, 1984, the Secretary shall not enter into a contract under this part with any entity which is, or is affiliated with (through management, ownership, or common control), an entity (other than a self-insured employer) which directly or indirectly makes payments to any practitioner or provider whose health care services are reviewed by such entity or would be reviewed by such entity if it entered into a contract with the Secretary under this part. For purposes of this paragraph, an entity shall not be considered to be affiliated with another entity which makes payments (directly or indirectly) to any practitioner or provider, by reason of management, ownership, or common control, if the management, ownership, or common control consists only of members of the governing board being affiliated (through management, ownership, or common control) with a health maintenance organization or competitive medical plan which is an &ldquo;eligible organization&rdquo; as defined in section 1395mm(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, after November 14, 1984, the Secretary determines that there is no other entity available for an area with which the Secretary can enter into a contract under this part, the Secretary may then enter into a contract under this part with an entity described in subparagraph (A) for such area if such entity otherwise meets the requirements of this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary shall not enter into a contract under this part with any entity which is, or is affiliated with (through management, ownership, or common control), a health care fa<!-- PDFPage:1561 -->cility, or association of such facilities, within the area served by such entity or which would be served by such entity if it entered into a contract with the Secretary under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), an entity shall not be considered to be affiliated with a health care facility or association of facilities by reason of management, ownership, or common control if the management, ownership, or common control consists only of not more than 20 percent of the members of the governing board of the entity being affiliated (through management, ownership, or common control) with one or more of such facilities or associations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms of contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each contract with an organization under this section shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the organization shall perform the functions set forth in section 1320c&ndash;3(a) of this section, or may subcontract for the performance of all or some of such functions (and for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (b) of this section, a subcontract under this paragraph shall not constitute an affiliation with the subcontractor);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary shall have the right to evaluate the quality and effectiveness of the organization in carrying out the functions specified in the contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the contract shall be for an initial term of three years and shall be renewable on a triennial basis thereafter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the organization has failed substantially to carry out the contract or is carrying out the contract in a manner inconsistent with the efficient and effective administration of this part, but only after such organization has had an opportunity to submit data and have such data reviewed by the panel established under subsection (d) of this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Secretary shall include in the contract negotiated objectives against which the organization's performance will be judged, and negotiated specifications for use of regional norms, or modifications thereof based on national norms, for performing review functions under the contract; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) reimbursement shall be made to the organization on a monthly basis, with payments for any month being made not later than 15 days after the close of such month.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

The Secretary shall make a copy of the report available to the organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may accept or not accept the findings of the panel. After the panel has submitted a report with respect to an organization, the Secretary may, with the concurrence of the organization, amend the contract to modify the scope of the functions to be carried out by the organization, or in any other manner. The Secretary may terminate a contract under the authority of subsection (c)(6)(B) of this section upon 90 days notice after the panel has submitted a report, or earlier if the organization so agrees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A panel appointed by the Secretary under this subsection shall consist of not more than five individuals, each of whom shall be a member of a utilization and quality control peer review organization having a contract with the Secretary under this part. While serving on such panel individuals shall be paid at a per diem rate not to exceed the current per diem equivalent at the time that service on the panel is rendered for grade GS&ndash;18 under section 5332 of title 5. Appointments shall be made without regard to title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) During the period after the Secretary has given notice of intent to terminate a contract, and prior to the time that the Secretary enters into a contract with another utilization and quality control peer review organization, the Secretary may transfer review responsibilities of the organization under the contract being terminated to another utilization and quality control peer review organization, or to an intermediary or carrier having an agreement under section 1395h of this title or a contract under section 1395u of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), contracting authority of the Secretary under this section may be carried out without regard to any provision of law relating to the making, performance, amendment, or modification of contracts of the United States as the Secretary may determine to be inconsistent with the purposes of this part. The Secretary may use different contracting methods with respect to different geographical areas.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1562 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) If a peer review organization with a contract under this section is required to carry out a review function in addition to any function required to be carried out at the time the Secretary entered into or renewed the contract with the organization, the Secretary shall, before requiring such organization to carry out such additional function, negotiate the necessary contractual modifications, including modifications that provide for an appropriate adjustment (in light of the cost of such additional function) to the amount of reimbursement made to the organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination not subject to judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any determination by the Secretary to terminate or not to renew a contract under this section shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Timely provision of hospital data to peer review organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide that fiscal intermediaries furnish to peer review organizations, each month on a timely basis, data necessary to initiate the review process under section 1320c&ndash;3(a) of this title on a timely basis. If the Secretary determines that a fiscal intermediary is unable to furnish such data on a timely basis, the Secretary shall require the hospital to do so.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Publication of new policy or procedure and general criteria and standards for evaluation; performance comparison report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register any new policy or procedure adopted by the Secretary that affects substantially the performance of contract obligations under this section not less than 30 days before the date on which such policy or procedure is to take effect. This paragraph shall not apply to the extent it is inconsistent with a statutory deadline.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register the general criteria and standards used for evaluating the efficient and effective performance of contract obligations under this section and shall provide opportunity for public comment with respect to such criteria and standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall regularly furnish each peer review organization with a contract under this section with a report that documents the performance of the organization in relation to the performance of other such organizations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Preference in contracting with in-State organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary shall not renew a contract with any organization that is not an in-State organization (as defined in paragraph (3)) unless the Secretary has first complied with the requirements of paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than six months before the date on which a contract period ends with respect to an organization that is not an in-State organization, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the date on which such period ends; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the period of time in which an in-State organization may submit a proposal for the contract ending on such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If one or more qualified in-State organizations submits a proposal within the period of time specified under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Secretary shall not automatically renew the current contract on a noncompetitive basis, but shall provide for competition for the contract in the same manner as a new contract under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, an in-State organization is an organization that has its primary place of business in the State in which review will be conducted (or, which is owned by a parent corporation the headquarters of which is located in such State).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any utilization and quality control peer review organization entering into a contract with the Secretary under this part must perform the following functions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The organization shall review some or all of the professional activities in the area, subject to the terms of the contract and subject to the requirements of subsection (d) of this section, of physicians and other health care practitioners and institutional and noninstitutional providers of health care services in the provision of health care services and items for which payment may be made (in whole or in part) under subchapter XVIII of this chapter (including where payment is made for such services to eligible organizations pursuant to contracts under section 1395mm of this title) for the purpose of determining whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such services and items are or were reasonable and medically necessary and whether such services and items are not al<!-- PDFPage:1564 -->lowable under subsection (a)(1) or (a)(9) of section 1395y of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the quality of such services meets professionally recognized standards of health care; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in case such services and items are proposed to be provided in a hospital or other health care facility on an inpatient basis, such services and items could, consistent with the provision of appropriate medical care, be effectively provided more economically on an outpatient basis or in an inpatient health care facility of a different type.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the organization performs such reviews with respect to a type of health care practitioner other than medical doctors, the organization shall establish procedures for the involvement of health care practitioners of that type in such reviews.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The organization shall determine, on the basis of the review carried out under subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) of paragraph (1), whether payment shall be made for services under subchapter XVIII of this chapter. Such determination shall constitute the conclusive determination on those issues for purposes of payment under subchapter XVIII of this chapter, except that payment may be made if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such payment is allowed by reason of section 1395pp of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of inpatient hospital services or extended care services, the peer review organization determines that additional time is required in order to arrange for postdischarge care, but payment may be continued under this subparagraph for not more than two days, but only in the case where the provider of such services did not know and could not reasonably have been expected to know (as determined under section 1395pp of this title) that payment would not otherwise be made for such services under subchapter XVIII of this chapter prior to notification by the organization under paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such determination is changed as the result of any hearing or review of the determination under section 1320c&ndash;4 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such payment is authorized under section 1395x(v)(1)(G) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The organization shall identify cases for which payment should not be made by reason of paragraph (1)(B) only through the use of criteria developed pursuant to guidelines established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (D), whenever the organization makes a determination that any health care services or items furnished or to be furnished to a patient by any practitioner or provider are disapproved, the organization shall promptly notify such patient and the agency or organization responsible for the payment of claims under subchapter XVIII of this chapter of such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The notification under subparagraph (A) with respect to services or items disapproved by reason of subparagraph (A) or (C) of paragraph (1) shall not occur until 20 days after the date that the organization has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) made a preliminary notification to such practitioner or provider of such proposed determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provided such practitioner or provider an opportunity for discussion and review of the proposed determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The discussion and review conducted under subparagraph (B)(ii) shall not affect the rights of a practitioner or provider to a formal reconsideration of a determination under this part (as provided under section 1320c&ndash;4 of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The notification under subparagraph (A) with respect to services or items disapproved by reason of paragraph (1)(B) shall not occur until after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the organization has notified the practitioner or provider involved of the determination and of the practitioner's or provider's right to a formal reconsideration of the determination under section 1320c&ndash;4 of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the provider or practitioner requests such a reconsideration, the organization has made such a reconsideration.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If a provider or practitioner is provided a reconsideration, such reconsideration shall be in lieu of any subsequent reconsideration to which the provider or practitioner may be otherwise entitled under section 1320c&ndash;4 of this title, but shall not affect the right of a beneficiary from seeking reconsideration under such section of the organization's determination (after any reconsideration requested by the provider or physician under clause (ii)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E)(i) In the case of services and items provided by a physician that were disapproved by reason of paragraph (1)(B), the notice to the patient shall state the following: &ldquo;In the judgment of the peer review organization, the medical care received was not acceptable under the medicare program. The reasons for the denial have been discussed with your physician.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) In the case of services or items provided by an entity or practitioner other than a physician, the Secretary may substitute the entity or practitioner which provided the services or items for the term &ldquo;physician&rdquo; in the notice described in clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) The organization shall, after consultation with the Secretary, determine the types and kinds of cases (whether by type of health care or diagnosis involved, or whether in terms of other relevant criteria relating to the provision of health care services) with respect to which such organization will, in order to most effectively carry out the purposes of this part, exercise review authority under the contract. The organization shall notify the Secretary periodically with respect to such determinations. Each peer review organization shall provide that a reasonable proportion of its activities are involved with reviewing, under paragraph (1)(B), the quality of services and that a reasonable allocation of such activities is made among the different cases and settings (including post-acute-care settings, ambulatory settings, and health maintenance organizations). In establishing such allocation, the organization shall consider (i) wheth<!-- PDFPage:1565 -->er there is reason to believe that there is a particular need for reviews of particular cases or settings because of previous problems regarding quality of care, (ii) the cost of such reviews and the likely yield of such reviews in terms of number and seriousness of quality of care problems likely to be discovered as a result of such reviews, and (iii) the availability and adequacy of alternative quality review and assurance mechanisms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The contract of each organization shall provide for the review of services (including both inpatient and outpatient services) provided by eligible organizations pursuant to a risk-sharing contract under section 1395mm of this title (or that is subject to review under section 1395ss(t)(3) of this title) for the purpose of determining whether the quality of such services meets professionally recognized standards of health care, including whether appropriate health care services have not been provided or have been provided in inappropriate settings and whether individuals enrolled with an eligible organization have adequate access to health care services provided by or through such organization (as determined, in part, by a survey of individuals enrolled with the organization who have not yet used the organization to receive such services). The contract of each organization shall also provide that with respect to health care provided by a health maintenance organization or competitive medical plan under section 1395mm of this title, the organization shall maintain a beneficiary outreach program designed to apprise individuals receiving care under such section of the role of the peer review system, of the rights of the individual under such system, and of the method and purposes for contacting the organization. The previous two sentences shall not apply with respect to a contract year if another entity has been awarded a contract under subparagraph (C). Under the contract the level of effort expended by the organization on reviews under this subparagraph shall be equivalent, on a per enrollee basis, to the level of effort expended by the organization on utilization and quality reviews performed with respect to individuals not enrolled with an eligible organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Secretary may provide, by contract under competitive procurement procedures on a State-by-State basis in up to 25 States, for the review described in subparagraph (B) by an appropriate entity (which may be a peer review organization described in that subparagraph). In selecting among States in which to conduct such competitive procurement procedures, the Secretary may not select States which, as a group, have more than 50 percent of the total number of individuals enrolled with eligible organizations under section 1395mm of this title. Under a contract with an entity under this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the entity must be, or must meet all the requirements under section 1320c&ndash;1 of this title to be, a utilization and quality control peer review organization (other than the ability to perform review functions under this section that are not described in subparagraph (B)),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the contract must meet the requirement of section 1320c&ndash;2(b)(3) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the level of effort expended under the contract shall be, to the extent practicable, not less than the level of effort that would otherwise be required under the third sentence of subparagraph (B) if this subparagraph did not apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The organization shall consult with nurses and other professional health care practitioners (other than physicians described in section 1395x(r)(1) of this title) and with representatives of institutional and noninstitutional providers of health care services, with respect to the organization's responsibility for the review under paragraph (1) of the professional activities of such practitioners and providers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A) The organization shall, consistent with the provisions of its contract under this part, apply professionally developed norms of care, diagnosis, and treatment based upon typical patterns of practice within the geographic area served by the organization as principal points of evaluation and review, taking into consideration national norms where appropriate. Such norms with respect to treatment for particular illnesses or health conditions shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the types and extent of the health care services which, taking into account differing, but acceptable, modes of treatment and methods of organizing and delivering care, are considered within the range of appropriate diagnosis and treatment of such illness or health condition, consistent with professionally recognized and accepted patterns of care; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the type of health care facility which is considered, consistent with such standards, to be the type in which health care services which are medically appropriate for such illness or condition can most economically be provided.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">As a component of the norms described in clause (i) or (ii), the organization shall take into account the special problems associated with delivering care in remote rural areas, the availability of service alternatives to inpatient hospitalization, and other appropriate factors (such as the distance from a patient's residence to the site of care, family support, availability of proximate alternative sites of care, and the patient's ability to carry out necessary or prescribed self-care regimens) that could adversely affect the safety or effectiveness of treatment provided on an outpatient basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The organization shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) offer to provide, several times each year, for a physician representing the organization to meet (at a hospital or at a regional meeting) with medical and administrative staff of each hospital (the services of which are reviewed by the organization) respecting the organization's review of the hospital's services for which payment may be made under subchapter XVIII of this chapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) publish (not less often than annually) and distribute to providers and practitioners <!-- PDFPage:1566 -->whose services are subject to review a report that describes the organization's findings with respect to the types of cases in which the organization has frequently determined that (I) inappropriate or unnecessary care has been provided, (II) services were rendered in an inappropriate setting, or (III) services did not meet professionally recognized standards of health care.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The organization, to the extent necessary and appropriate to the performance of the contract, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) make arrangements to utilize the services of persons who are practitioners of, or specialists in, the various areas of medicine (including dentistry, optometry, and podiatry), or other types of health care, which persons shall, to the maximum extent practicable, be individuals engaged in the practice of their profession within the area served by such organization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of psychiatric and physical rehabilitation services, make arrangements to ensure that (to the extent possible) initial review of such services be made by a physician who is trained in psychiatry or physical rehabilitation (as appropriate).<sup><a href="#1320c-3_1_target" name="1320c-3_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) undertake such professional inquiries either before or after, or both before and after, the provision of services with respect to which such organization has a responsibility for review which in the judgment of such organization will facilitate its activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) examine the pertinent records of any practitioner or provider of health care services providing services with respect to which such organization has a responsibility for review under paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) inspect the facilities in which care is rendered or services are provided (which are located in such area) of any practitioner or provider of health care services providing services with respect to which such organization has a responsibility for review under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The organization shall perform such duties and functions and assume such responsibilities and comply with such other requirements as may be required by this part or under regulations of the Secretary promulgated to carry out the provisions of this part or as may be required to carry out section 1395y(a)(15) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9)(A) The organization shall collect such information relevant to its functions, and keep and maintain such records, in such form as the Secretary may require to carry out the purposes of this part, and shall permit access to and use of any such information and records as the Secretary may require for such purposes, subject to the provisions of section 1320c&ndash;9 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the organization finds, after reasonable notice to and opportunity for discussion with the physician or practitioner concerned, that the physician or practitioner has furnished services in violation of section 1320c&ndash;5(a) of this title and the organization determines that the physician or practitioner should enter into a corrective action plan under section 1320c&ndash;5(b)(1) of this title, the organization shall notify the State board or boards responsible for the licensing or disciplining of the physician or practitioner of its finding and of any action taken as a result of the finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The organization shall coordinate activities, including information exchanges, which are consistent with economical and efficient operation of programs among appropriate public and private agencies or organizations including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) agencies under contract pursuant to sections 1395h and 1395u of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) other peer review organizations having contracts under this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) other public or private review organizations as may be appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The organization shall make available its facilities and resources for contracting with private and public entities paying for health care in its area for review, as feasible and appropriate, of services reimbursed by such entities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Repealed. Pub. L. 103&ndash;432, title I, &sect;156(a)(2)(A)(i), Oct. 31, 1994, 108 Stat. 4440.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Notwithstanding paragraph (4), the organization shall perform the review described in paragraph (1) with respect to early readmission cases to determine if the previous inpatient hospital services and the post-hospital services met professionally recognized standards of health care. Such reviews may be performed on a sample basis if the organization and the Secretary determine it to be appropriate. In this paragraph, an &ldquo;early readmission case&rdquo; is a case in which an individual, after discharge from a hospital, is readmitted to a hospital less than 31 days after the date of the most recent previous discharge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) The organization shall conduct an appropriate review of all written complaints about the quality of services (for which payment may otherwise be made under subchapter XVIII of this chapter) not meeting professionally recognized standards of health care, if the complaint is filed with the organization by an individual entitled to benefits for such services under such subchapter (or a person acting on the individual's behalf).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) During each year of the contract entered into under section 1320c&ndash;2(b) of this title, the organization shall perform significant on-site review activities, including on-site review in at least 20 percent of the rural hospitals in the organization's area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) The organization shall provide for a review and report to the Secretary when requested by the Secretary under section 1395dd(d)(3) of this title.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Assurances regarding services and items ordered or provided by practitioner or provider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the obligation of any health care practitioner and any other person (including a hospital or other health care facility, organization, or agency) who provides health care services for which payment may be made (in whole or in part) under this chapter, to assure, to the extent of his authority that services or items ordered or provided by such practitioner or person to beneficiaries and recipients under this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be provided economically and only when, and to the extent, medically necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will be of a quality which meets professionally recognized standards of health care; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will be supported by evidence of medical necessity and quality in such form and fashion and at such time as may reasonably be required by a reviewing peer review organization in the exercise of its duties and responsibilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sanctions and penalties; hearings and review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If after reasonable notice and opportunity for discussion with the practitioner or person concerned, and, if appropriate, after the practitioner or person has been given a reasonable opportunity to enter into and complete a corrective action plan (which may include remedial education) agreed to by the organization, and has failed successfully to complete such plan, any organization having a contract with the Secretary under this part determines that such practitioner or person has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) failed in a substantial number of cases substantially to comply with any obligation imposed on him under subsection (a) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) grossly and flagrantly violated any such obligation in one or more instances,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such organization shall submit a report and recommendations to the Secretary. If the Secretary agrees with such determination, the Secretary (in addition to any other sanction provided under law) may exclude (permanently or for such period as the Secretary may prescribe, except that such period may not be less than 1 year) such practitioner or person from eligibility to provide services under this chapter on a reimbursable basis. If the Secretary fails to act upon the recommendations submitted to him by such organization within 120 days after such submission, such practitioner or person shall be excluded from eligibility to provide services on a reimbursable basis until such time as the Secretary determines otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A determination made by the Secretary under this subsection to exclude a practitioner or person shall be effective on the same date and in the same manner as an exclusion from participation under the programs under this chapter becomes effective under section 1320a&ndash;7(c) of this title, and shall (subject to the minimum period specified in the second sentence of paragraph (1)) remain in effect until the Secretary finds and gives reasonable notice to the public that the basis for such determination has been removed and that there is reasonable assurance that it will not recur.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In lieu of the sanction authorized by paragraph (1), the Secretary may require that (as a condition to the continued eligibility of such practitioner or person to provide such health care services on a reimbursable basis) such practitioner or person pays&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1320c-5_1_target" name="1320c-5_1">1</a></sup> to the United States, in case such acts or conduct involved the provision or ordering by such practitioner or person of health care services which were medically improper or unnecessary, an amount not in excess of up to $10,000 for each instance of the medically improper or unnecessary services so provided. Such amount may be deducted from any sums owing by the United States (or any instrumentality thereof) to the practitioner or person from whom such amount is claimed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any practitioner or person furnishing services described in paragraph (1) who is dissatisfied with a determination made by the Secretary under this subsection shall be entitled to reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing thereon by the Secretary to the same extent as is provided in section 405(b) of this title, and to judicial review of the Secretary's final decision after such hearing as is provided in section 405(g) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Before the Secretary may effect an exclusion under paragraph (2) in the case of a provider or practitioner located in a rural health professional shortage area or in a county with a population of less than 70,000, the provider or practitioner adversely affected by the determination is entitled to a hearing before an administrative law judge (described in section 405(b) of this title) respecting whether the provider or practitioner should be able to continue furnishing services to individuals entitled to benefits under this chapter, pending completion of the administrative review procedure under paragraph (4). If the judge does not determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the provider or practitioner will pose a serious risk to such individuals if permitted to continue furnishing such services, the Secretary shall not effect the exclusion under paragraph (2) until the provider or practitioner has been provided reasonable notice and opportunity for an administrative hearing thereon under paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) When the Secretary effects an exclusion of a physician under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall notify the State board responsible for the licensing of the physician of the exclusion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enlistment of support of other organizations to assure practitioner's or provider's compliance with obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of each utilization and quality control peer review organization to use such authority or influence it may possess as a professional organization, and to enlist the support of any other professional or governmental organization having influence or authority over health care practitioners and any other person (including a hospital or other health care facil<!-- PDFPage:1573 -->ity, organization, or agency) providing health care services in the area served by such review organization, in assuring that each practitioner or person (referred to in subsection (a) of this section) providing health care services in such area shall comply with all obligations imposed on him under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
