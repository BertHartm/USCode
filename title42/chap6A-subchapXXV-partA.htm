<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such exclusion extends for a period of not more than 12 months (or 18 months in the case of a late enrollee) after the enrollment date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the period of any such preexisting condition exclusion is reduced by the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage (if any, as defined in subsection (c)(1) of this section) applicable to the participant or beneficiary as of the enrollment date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance, may elect to apply subsection (a)(3) of this section based on coverage of benefits within each of several classes or categories of benefits specified in regulations rather than as provided under subparagraph (A).

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall include in such statements a description of the effect of such election.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Establishment of period</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exclusion not applicable to certain newborns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (4), a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion in the case of an individual who, as of the last day of the 30-day period beginning with the date of birth, is covered under creditable coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exclusion not applicable to certain adopted children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (4), a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion in the case of a child who is adopted or placed for adoption before attaining 18 years of age and who, as of the last day of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the adoption or placement for adoption, is covered under creditable coverage. The previous sentence shall not apply to coverage before the date of such adoption or placement for adoption.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Exclusion not applicable to pregnancy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan, and health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion relating to pregnancy as a preexisting condition.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Issuer compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that medical care under a group health plan consists of group health insurance coverage, the plan is deemed to have satisfied the certification requirement under this paragraph if the health insurance issuer offering the coverage provides for such certification in accordance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The employee stated in writing at such time that coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage was the reason for declining enrollment, but only if the plan sponsor or issuer (if applicable) required such a statement at such time and provided the employee with notice of such requirement (and the consequences of such requirement) at such time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The employee's or dependent's coverage described in subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was under a COBRA continuation provision and the coverage under such provision was exhausted; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was not under such a provision and either the coverage was terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for the coverage (including as a result of legal separation, divorce, death, termination of employment, or reduction in the number of hours of employment) or employer contributions toward such coverage were terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Under the terms of the plan, the employee requests such enrollment not later than 30 days after the date of exhaustion of coverage described in subparagraph (C)(i) or termination of coverage or employer contribution described in subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a group health plan makes coverage available with respect to a dependent of an individual,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the individual is a participant under the plan (or has met any waiting period applicable to becoming a participant under the plan and is eligible to be enrolled under the plan but for a failure to enroll during a previous enrollment period), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a person becomes such a dependent of the individual through marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for adoption,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the group health plan shall provide for a dependent special enrollment period described in subparagraph (B) during which the person (or, if not otherwise enrolled, the individual) may be enrolled under the plan as a dependent of the individual, and in the case of the birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of the individual may be enrolled as a depend<!-- PDFPage:908 -->ent of the individual if such spouse is otherwise eligible for coverage.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No waiting period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an individual seeks to enroll a dependent during the first 30 days of such a dependent special enrollment period, the coverage of the dependent shall become effective&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of marriage, not later than the first day of the first month beginning after the date the completed request for enrollment is received;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use of affiliation period by HMOs as alternative to preexisting condition exclusion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A health maintenance organization which offers health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan and which does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion allowed under subsection (a) of this section with respect to any particular coverage option may impose an affiliation period for such coverage option, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such period is applied uniformly without regard to any health status-related factors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such period does not exceed 2 months (or 3 months in the case of a late enrollee).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Affiliation period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such period shall begin on the enrollment date.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Runs concurrently with waiting periods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An affiliation period under a plan shall run concurrently with any waiting period under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Alternative methods</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Separate application to each option offered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a group health plan that offers a participant or beneficiary two or more benefit package options under the plan, the requirements of this section shall be applied separately with respect to each such option.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Discontinuance of all coverage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which a health insurance issuer elects to discontinue offering all health insurance coverage in the small group market or the large group market, or both markets, in a State, health insurance coverage may be discontinued by the issuer only in accordance with applicable State law and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the issuer provides notice to the applicable State authority and to each plan sponsor (and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of such discontinuation at least 180 days prior to the date of the discontinuation of such coverage; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for uniform modification of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the time of coverage renewal, a health insurance issuer may modify the health insurance coverage for a product offered to a group health plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the large group market; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the small group market if, for coverage that is available in such market other than only through one or more bona fide associations, such modification is consistent with State law and effective on a uniform basis among group health plans with that product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application to coverage offered only through associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In applying this section in the case of health insurance coverage that is made available by a health insurance issuer in the small or large group market to employers only through one or more associations, a reference to &ldquo;plan sponsor&rdquo; is deemed, with respect to coverage provided to an employer member of the association, to include a reference to such employer.</p>
