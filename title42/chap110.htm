<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to assist in supporting the establishment, maintenance, and expansion of programs and projects to prevent incidents of family violence and to provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of family violence and their dependents, the Secretary is authorized, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, to make grants to States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No grant may be made under this subsection unless the chief executive officer of the State seeking such grant submits an application to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may reasonably require. Each such application shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide that funds provided under this subsection will be distributed in grants to local public agencies and nonprofit private organizations (including religious and charitable organizations, and voluntary associations) for programs and projects within such State to prevent incidents of family violence and to provide immediate shelter and related assistance for victims of family violence and their dependents in order to prevent future violent incidents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide, with respect to funds provided to a State under this subsection for any fiscal year, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) not more than 5 percent of such funds will be used for State administrative costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the distribution of funds by the State under this subsection, the State will give special emphasis to the support of community-based projects of demonstrated effectiveness carried out by nonprofit private organizations, the primary purpose of which is to operate shelters for victims of family violence and their dependents, and those which provide counseling, advocacy, and self-help services to victims and their children.<sup><a href="#10402_1_target" name="10402_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) set forth procedures designed to involve State domestic violence coalitions, knowledgeable individuals, and interested organizations and assure an equitable distribution of grants and grant funds within the State and between urban and rural areas within such State and a plan to address the needs of underserved populations, as defined in section 3796gg&ndash;2 of this title;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10402_2_target" name="10402_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) specify the State agency to be designated as responsible for the administration of programs and activities relating to family violence which are carried out by the State under this chapter and for coordination of related programs within the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) provide documentation that procedures have been developed, and implemented including copies of the policies and procedure, to assure the confidentiality of records pertaining to any individual provided family violence prevention or treatment services by any program assisted under this chapter and provide assurances that the address or location of any shelter-facility assisted under this chapter will, except with written authorization of the person or persons responsible for the operation of such shelter, not be made public;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall approve any application that meets the requirements of this subsection, and the Secretary shall not disapprove any such application except after reasonable notice of the Secretary's intention to disapprove and after a 6-month period providing an opportunity for correction of any deficiencies. The Secretary shall provide such notice within 45 days of the date of the application if any of the provisions of paragraph (2) have not been satisfied in such application. If the State has not corrected the deficiencies in such application within the 6-month period following the receipt of the Secretary's notice of intention to disapprove, the Secretary shall withhold payment of any grant funds to such State until the date that is 30 days prior to the end of the fiscal year for which such grant funds are appropriated or until such time as the State provides documentation that the deficiencies have been corrected, whichever occurs first. State Domestic Violence Coalitions shall be permitted to participate in determining whether a grantee is in compliance with paragraph (2), except that no <!-- PDFPage:6113 -->funds made available to State Domestic Violence Coalitions under section 10410 of this title shall be used to challenge a determination as to whether a grantee is in compliance with, or to seek the enforcement of, the eligibility requirements of such paragraph.</p>

The Director shall suspend funding for an approved application if an applicant fails to submit an annual performance report or if the funds are expended for purposes other than those set forth under this subpart,<sup><a href="#10402_2_target" name="10402_2">2</a></sup> after following the procedures set forth in paragraph (3). Federal funds may be used only to supplement, not supplant, State funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Upon completion of the activities funded by a grant under this chapter, the State shall submit to the Secretary a report that contains a description of the activities carried out under paragraph (2)(B)(i).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Federal Employee Domestic Violence Awareness Campaign</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Oct. 2, 1995, 60 F.R. 52821, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">Domestic violence is not a private, family dispute that affects only the people involved. Domestic violence is violent criminal activity that affects us all, regardless of race, income, or age, in every community in this country. It means higher health care costs, increased absenteeism, and declining productivity. It destroys families, relationships, and lives. More importantly, it tears at the moral fabric of who we are and undermines the very institution that has been the cornerstone of our country: the family.</p>
<p class="note-body">In passing the Violence Against Women Act [probably means the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, title IV of Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, see Tables for classification] as part of the Violent Crime Control Act (&ldquo;VCCA&rdquo;) [probably means the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, see Tables for classification] last year, the Congress recognized the seriousness of the problem of domestic violence. This new law combines tough new penalties with programs to prosecute offenders and help women victims. In the last year, every State has received a down payment of $426,000 in grants to help train prosecutors, police, and service providers in combatting the problem of domestic violence. Moreover, because of the VCCA, every State will now ensure that women who have been assaulted will not have to pay for their medical examinations resulting from rape and other acts of violence.</p>
<p class="note-body">Throughout October, National Domestic Violence Awareness Month, business, labor, law enforcement, public health, and civic organizations will be working to increase our understanding of this problem and create solutions that can save lives. I believe the Federal Government has a responsibility to be a leader in this effort.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, I am directing that executive departments and agencies institute employee awareness campaigns on domestic violence. Within the next 6 months, you should implement a program to promote Federal employee awareness of the problem of domestic violence and the programs and resources that are available for victims. I support and encourage the initial plans made by the Justice Department, which include the production of a resource manual and a poster, and the scheduling of a Violence Against Women Information Fair on October 30, 1995. This fair will include speakers, artwork, and exhibits.</p>
<p class="note-body">We have a responsibility to assist all victims of domestic violence and their families trapped in a cycle of violence with no sense of where to turn. Often, victims will not report their circumstances to the public, but they may turn to coworkers for help. Thus, by providing information to all Federal workers on the programs available, we can make a contribution to the effort to protect women from abuse and reduce the level of violence in America.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
