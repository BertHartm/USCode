<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7671b. Monitoring and reporting requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 270 days after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall amend the regulations of the Administrator in effect on such date regarding monitoring and reporting of class I and class II substances. Such amendments shall conform to the requirements of this section. The amended regulations shall include requirements with respect to the time and manner of monitoring and reporting as required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Production, import, and export level reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On a quarterly basis, or such other basis (not less than annually) as determined by the Administrator, each person who produced, imported, or exported a class I or class II substance shall file a report with the Administrator setting forth the amount of the substance that such person produced, imported, and exported during the preceding reporting period. Each such report shall be signed and attested by a responsible officer. No such report shall be required from a person after April 1 of the calendar year after such person permanently ceases production, importation, and exportation of the substance and so notifies the Administrator in writing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Baseline reports for class I substances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless such information has previously been reported to the Administrator, on the date on <!-- PDFPage:4679 -->which the first report under subsection (b) of this section is required to be filed, each person who produced, imported, or exported a class I substance (other than a substance added to the list of class I substances after the publication of the initial list of such substances under this section) shall file a report with the Administrator setting forth the amount of such substance that such person produced, imported, and exported during the baseline year. In the case of a substance added to the list of class I substances after publication of the initial list of such substances under this section, the regulations shall require that each person who produced, imported, or exported such substance shall file a report with the Administrator within 180 days after the date on which such substance is added to the list, setting forth the amount of the substance that such person produced, imported, and exported in the baseline year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Monitoring and reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall monitor and, not less often than every 3 years following November 15, 1990, submit a report to Congress on the production, use and consumption of class I and class II substances. Such report shall include data on domestic production, use and consumption, and an estimate of worldwide production, use and consumption of such substances. Not less frequently than every 6 years the Administrator shall report to Congress on the environmental and economic effects of any stratospheric ozone depletion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrators of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration shall monitor, and not less often than every 3 years following November 15, 1990, submit a report to Congress on the current average tropospheric concentration of chlorine and bromine and on the level of stratospheric ozone depletion. Such reports shall include updated projections of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) peak chlorine loading;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the rate at which the atmospheric abundance of chlorine is projected to decrease after the year 2000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the date by which the atmospheric abundance of chlorine is projected to return to a level of two parts per billion.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such updated projections shall be made on the basis of current international and domestic controls on substances covered by this subchapter as well as on the basis of such controls supplemented by a year 2000 global phase out of all halocarbon emissions (the base case). It is the purpose of the Congress through the provisions of this section to monitor closely the production and consumption of class II substances to assure that the production and consumption of such substances will not:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) increase significantly the peak chlorine loading that is projected to occur under the base case established for purposes of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) reduce significantly the rate at which the atmospheric abundance of chlorine is projected to decrease under the base case; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) delay the date by which the average atmospheric concentration of chlorine is projected under the base case to return to a level of two parts per billion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Technology status report in 2015</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall review, on a periodic basis, the progress being made in the development of alternative systems or products necessary to manufacture and operate appliances without class II substances. If the Administrator finds, after notice and opportunity for public comment, that as a result of technological development problems, the development of such alternative systems or products will not occur within the time necessary to provide for the manufacture of such equipment without such substances prior to the applicable deadlines under section 7671d of this title, the Administrator shall, not later than January 1, 2015, so inform the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Emergency report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in consultation with the Administrators of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, the Administrator determines that the global production, consumption, and use of class II substances are projected to contribute to an atmospheric chlorine loading in excess of the base case projections by more than 5/10ths parts per billion, the Administrator shall so inform the Congress immediately. The determination referred to in the preceding sentence shall be based on the monitoring under subsection (d) of this section and updated not less often than every 3 years.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Economically Justified Actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 2 years after enactment of this Act [Nov. 15, 1990], the Administrator shall prepare and submit a report to the Congress that identifies activities, substances, processes, or combinations thereof that could reduce methane emissions and that are economically and technologically justified with and without consideration of environmental benefit.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Domestic Methane Source Inventory and Control</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 2 years after the enactment of this Act [Nov. 15, 1990], the Administrator, in consultation and coordination with the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Agriculture, shall prepare and submit to the Congress reports on each of the following:</p>
