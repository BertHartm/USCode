<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) because of national budgetary considerations, it has become necessary to terminate Federal appropriations for Public Health Service hospitals and clinics,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) with proper planning and coordination, some of these hospitals and clinics could be transferred to State, local, or private control or become financially self-sufficient and continue to provide effective and efficient health care to individuals in the areas in which they are located,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) a precipitous closure of these hospitals and clinics will preclude the possibility of such orderly transfer to entities which are willing and able to take over operations at such facilities and will cause unnecessary and costly hardships on the patients and staffs at such facilities and on the communities in which the facilities are located, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) it is in the national interest, consistent with sound budgetary considerations, to assist in the orderly and prompt transfer of such operations to State, local, or private operation or in the achievement of financial self-sufficiency where feasible.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The purposes of this subtitle [enacting this section, amending sections 201, 249, and 254e of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under section 249 of this title] are&mdash;</p>
