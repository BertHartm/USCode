<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Referral for rehabilitation services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is declared to be the policy of the Congress that disabled individuals applying for a deter<!-- PDFPage:1115 -->mination of disability, and disabled individuals who are entitled to child's insurance benefits, widow's insurance benefits, or widower's insurance benefits, shall be promptly referred to the State agency or agencies administering or supervising the administration of the State plan approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 720 et seq.] for necessary vocational rehabilitation services, to the end that the maximum number of such individuals may be rehabilitated into productive activity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deductions on account of refusal to accept rehabilitation services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Deductions, in such amounts and at such time or times as the Commissioner of Social Security shall determine, shall be made from any payment or payments under this subchapter to which an individual is entitled, until the total of such deductions equals such individual's benefit or benefits under sections 402 and 423 of this title for any month in which such individual, if a child who has attained the age of eighteen and is entitled to child's insurance benefits, a widow, widower, surviving divorced wife, or surviving divorced husband who has not attained age 60, or an individual entitled to disability insurance benefits, refuses without good cause to accept rehabilitation services available to him under a State plan approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 720 et seq.]. Any individual who is a member or adherent of any recognized church or religious sect which teaches its members or adherents to rely solely, in the treatment and cure of any physical or mental impairment, upon prayer or spiritual means through the application and use of the tenets or teachings of such church or sect, and who, solely because of his adherence to the teachings or tenets of such church, or sect, refuses to accept rehabilitation services available to him under a State plan approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, shall, for the purposes of the first sentence of this subsection, be deemed to have done so with good cause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Deductions shall be made from any child's insurance benefit to which a child who has attained the age of eighteen is entitled or from any mother's or father's insurance benefit to which a person is entitled, until the total of such deductions equals such child's insurance benefit or benefits or such mother's or father's insurance benefit or benefits under section 402 of this title for any month in which such child or person entitled to mother's or father's insurance benefits is married to an individual who is entitled to disability insurance benefits and in which such individual refuses to accept rehabilitation services and a deduction, on account of such refusal, is imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection. If both this paragraph and paragraph (3) of this subsection are applicable to a child's insurance benefit for any month, only an amount equal to such benefit shall be deducted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Deductions shall be made from any wife's, husband's, or child's insurance benefit, based on the wages and self-employment income of an individual entitled to disability insurance benefits, to which a wife, divorced wife, husband, divorced husband, or child is entitled, until the total of such deductions equals such wife's, husband's, or child's insurance benefit or benefits under section 402 of this title for any month in which the individual, on the basis of whose wages and self-employment income such benefit was payable, refuses to accept rehabilitation services and deductions, on account of such refusal, are imposed under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The provisions of paragraph (1) shall not apply to any child entitled to benefits under section 402(d) of this title, if he has attained the age of 18 but has not attained the age of 22, for any month during which he is a full-time elementary or secondary school student (as defined and determined under section 402(d) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Period of trial work&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The term &ldquo;period of trial work&rdquo;, with respect to an individual entitled to benefits under section 423, 402(d), 402(e), or 402(f) of this title, means a period of months beginning and ending as provided in paragraphs (3) and (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of sections 416(i) and 423 of this title, any services rendered by an individual during a period of trial work shall be deemed not to have been rendered by such individual in determining whether his disability has ceased in a month during such period. For purposes of this subsection the term &ldquo;services&rdquo; means activity (whether legal or illegal) which is performed for remuneration or gain or is determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be of a type normally performed for remuneration or gain.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A period of trial work for any individual shall begin with the month in which he becomes entitled to disability insurance benefits, or, in the case of an individual entitled to benefits under section 402(d) of this title who has attained the age of eighteen, with the month in which he becomes entitled to such benefits or the month in which he attains the age of eighteen, whichever is later, or, in the case of an individual entitled to widow's or widower's insurance benefits under section 402(e) or (f) of this title who became entitled to such benefits prior to attaining age 60, with the month in which such individual becomes so entitled. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, no period of trial work may begin for any individual prior to the beginning of the month following September 1960; and no such period may begin for an individual in a period of disability of such individual in which he had a previous period of trial work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A period of trial work for any individual shall end with the close of whichever of the following months is the earlier:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the ninth month, in any period of 60 consecutive months, in which the individual renders services (whether or not such nine months are consecutive); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the month in which his disability (as defined in section 423(d) of this title) ceases (as determined after application of paragraph (2) of this subsection).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cost of rehabilitation services from trust funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of making vocational rehabilitation services more readily available to disabled individuals who are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) entitled to disability insurance benefits under section 423 of this title,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1116 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) entitled to child's insurance benefits under section 402(d) of this title after having attained age 18 (and are under a disability),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) entitled to widow's insurance benefits under section 402(e) of this title prior to attaining age 60, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) entitled to widower's insurance benefits under section 402(f) of this title prior to attaining age 60,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">to the end that savings will accrue to the Trust Funds as a result of rehabilitating such individuals, there are authorized to be transferred from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary to enable the Commissioner of Social Security to reimburse the State for the reasonable and necessary costs of vocational rehabilitation services furnished such individuals (including services during their waiting periods), under a State plan for vocational rehabilitation services approved under title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 720 et seq.], (i) in cases where the furnishing of such services results in the performance by such individuals of substantial gainful activity for a continuous period of nine months, (ii) in cases where such individuals receive benefits as a result of section 425(b) of this title (except that no reimbursement under this paragraph shall be made for services furnished to any individual receiving such benefits for any period after the close of such individual's ninth consecutive month of substantial gainful activity or the close of the month in which his or her entitlement to such benefits ceases, whichever first occurs), and (iii) in cases where such individuals, without good cause, refuse to continue to accept vocational rehabilitation services or fail to cooperate in such a manner as to preclude their successful rehabilitation. The determination that the vocational rehabilitation services contributed to the successful return of an individual to substantial gainful activity, the determination that an individual, without good cause, refused to continue to accept vocational rehabilitation services or failed to cooperate in such a manner as to preclude successful rehabilitation, and the determination of the amount of costs to be reimbursed under this subsection shall be made by the Commissioner of Social Security in accordance with criteria formulated by the Commissioner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any State which is unwilling to participate or does not have a plan which meets the requirements of paragraph (1), the Commissioner of Social Security may provide such services in such State by agreement or contract with other public or private agencies, organizations, institutions, or individuals. The provision of such services shall be subject to the same conditions as otherwise apply under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Payments under this subsection shall be made in advance or by way of reimbursement, with necessary adjustments for overpayments and underpayments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Money paid from the Trust Funds under this subsection for the reimbursement of the costs of providing services to individuals who are entitled to benefits under section 423 of this title (including services during their waiting periods), or who are entitled to benefits under section 402(d) of this title on the basis of the wages and self-employment income of such individuals, shall be charged to the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund, and all other money paid from the Trust Funds under this subsection shall be charged to the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund. The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine according to such methods and procedures as the Commissioner may deem appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount to be reimbursed for the cost of services under this subsection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) subject to the provisions of the preceding sentence, the amount which should be charged to each of the Trust Funds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection the term &ldquo;vocational rehabilitation services&rdquo; shall have the meaning assigned to it in title I of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 720 et seq.], except that such services may be limited in type, scope, or amount in accordance with regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security designed to achieve the purpose of this subsection.</p>
