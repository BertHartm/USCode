<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establish or update flood-risk zone data in all such areas, and make estimates with respect to the rates of probable flood caused loss for the various flood risk zones for each of these areas until the date specified in section 4026 of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3697 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Accelerated identification of flood-risk zones; authority of Director: grants, technical assistance, transactions, and payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director is directed to accelerate the identification of risk zones within flood-prone and mudslide-prone areas, as provided by subsection (a)(2) of this section, in order to make known the degree of hazard within each such zone at the earliest possible date. To accomplish this objective, the Director is authorized, without regard to subsections (a) and (b) of section 3324 of title 31 and section 5 of title 41, to make grants, provide technical assistance, and enter into contracts, cooperative agreements, or other transactions, on such terms as he may deem appropriate, or consent to modifications thereof, and to make advance or progress payments in connection therewith.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Once during each 5-year period (the 1st such period beginning on September 23, 1994) or more often as the Director determines necessary, the Director shall assess the need to revise and update all floodplain areas and flood risk zones identified, delineated, or established under this section, based on an analysis of all natural hazards affecting flood risks.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Updating flood maps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall revise and update any floodplain areas and flood-risk zones&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) upon the determination of the Director, according to the assessment under subsection (e) of this section, that revision and updating are necessary for the areas and zones; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) upon the request from any State or local government stating that specific floodplain areas or flood-risk zones in the State or locality need revision or updating, if sufficient technical data justifying the request is submitted and the unit of government making the request agrees to provide funds in an amount determined by the Director, but which may not exceed 50 percent of the cost of carrying out the requested revision or update.</p>

Such notice shall be published or otherwise provided not later than 30 days after the map change or revision becomes effective. Notice by any method other than publication in the Federal Register shall include all pertinent information, provide for regular and frequent distribution, and be at least as accessible to map users as notice in the Federal Register. All notices under this subsection shall include information on how to obtain copies of the changes or revisions.</p>
