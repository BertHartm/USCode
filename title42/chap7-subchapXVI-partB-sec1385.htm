<h4 class="note-head">Puerto Rico, Guam, and Virgin Islands</h4>
<p class="note-body">Enactment of subchapter XVI of the Social Security Act [this subchapter] by section 301 of Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, eff. Jan. 1, 1974, was not applicable to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. See section 303(b) of Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, set out as a note under section 301 of this title. Therefore, as to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, section 1605 of the Social Security Act [this section] as it existed prior to reenactment of this subchapter by Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, and as amended, continues to apply and to read as follows:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&sect;1385. Definitions</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;aid to the aged, blind, or disabled&rdquo; means money payments to <!-- PDFPage:1950 -->needy individuals who are 65 years of age or older, are blind, or are 18 years of age or over and permanently and totally disabled, but such term does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) any such payments to or care in behalf of any individual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution); or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) any such payments to or care in behalf of any individual who has not attained 65 years of age and who is a patient in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Such term also includes payments which are not included within the meaning of such term under the preceding sentence, but which would be so included except that they are made on behalf of such a needy individual to another individual who (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such needy individual, but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 1382 of this title includes provision for&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) determination by the State agency that such needy individual has, by reason of his physical or mental condition, such inability to manage funds that making payments to him would be contrary to his welfare and, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid through payments described in this sentence;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) making such payments only in cases in which such payments will, under the rules otherwise applicable under the State plan for determining need and the amount of aid to the aged, blind, or disabled to be paid (and in conjunction with other income and resources), meet all the need [sic] of the individuals with respect to whom such payments are made;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) undertaking and continuing special efforts to protect the welfare of such individual and to improve, to the extent possible, his capacity for self-care and to manage funds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(D) periodic review by such State agency of the determination under clause (A) of this subsection to ascertain whether conditions justifying such determination still exist, with provision for termination of such payments if they do not and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative, as described in section 1311 of this title, if and when it appears that such action will best serve the interests of such needy individual; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(E) opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on the determination referred to in clause (A) of this subsection for any individual with respect to whom it is made.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">At the option of a State (if its plan approved under this subchapter so provides), such term (i) need not include money payments to an individual who has been absent from such State for a period in excess of ninety consecutive days (regardless of whether he has maintained his residence in such State during such period) until he has been present in such State for thirty consecutive days in the case of such an individual who has maintained his residence in such State during such period or ninety consecutive days in the case of any other such individual, and (ii) may include rent payments made directly to a public housing agency on behalf of a recipient or a group or groups of recipients of aid under such plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Repealed. Pub. L. 97&ndash;35, title XXI, &sect;2184(d)(6)(B), Aug. 13, 1981, 95 Stat. 818.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">(Aug. 14, 1935, ch. 531, title XVI, &sect;1605, as added July 25, 1962, Pub. L. 87&ndash;543, title I, &sect;141(a), 76 Stat. 204; amended July 30, 1965, Pub.
