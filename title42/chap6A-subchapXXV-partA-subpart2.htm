<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (c)(3) of this section, restrict benefits for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) of this section in a manner which is less favorable than the benefits provided for any preceding portion of such stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a mother who is a participant or beneficiary&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of this section shall not apply with respect to health insurance coverage if there is a State law (as defined in section 300gg&ndash;23(d)(1) of this title) for a State that regulates such coverage that is described in any of the following subparagraphs:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1160 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Such State law requires such coverage to provide for at least a 48-hour hospital length of stay following a normal vaginal delivery and at least a 96-hour hospital length of stay following a cesarean section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) apply the applicable lifetime limit both to the medical and surgical benefits to which it otherwise would apply and to mental health and substance use disorder benefits and not distinguish in the application of such limit between such medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not include any aggregate lifetime limit on mental health or substance use disorder benefits that is less than the applicable lifetime limit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Rule in case of different limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan or coverage that is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and that includes no or different aggregate lifetime limits on different categories of medical and surgical benefits, the Secretary shall establish rules under which subparagraph (B) is applied to such plan or coverage with respect to mental health and substance use disorder benefits by substituting for the applicable lifetime limit an average aggregate lifetime limit that is computed taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime limits applicable to such categories.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health or substance use disorder benefits&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the financial requirements applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant financial requirements applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage), and there are no separate cost sharing requirements that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the treatment limitations applicable to such mental health or substance use disorder benefits are no more restrictive than the predominant treatment limitations applied to substantially all medical and surgical benefits covered by the plan (or coverage) and there are no separate treatment limitations that are applicable only with respect to mental health or substance use disorder benefits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan), if the application of this section to such plan (or coverage) results in an increase for the plan year involved of the actual total costs of coverage with respect to medical and surgical benefits and mental health and substance use disorder benefits under the plan (as determined and certified under subparagraph (C)) by an amount that exceeds the applicable percentage described in subparagraph (B) of the actual total plan costs, the provisions of this section shall not apply to such plan (or coverage) during the following plan year, and such exemption shall apply to the plan (or coverage) for 1 plan year.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Notification</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A group health plan (or a health insurance issuer offering coverage in connection with a group health plan) that, based upon a certification described under subparagraph (C), qualifies for an exemption under this paragraph, and elects to implement the exemption, shall promptly notify the Secretary, the appropriate State agencies, and participants and beneficiaries in the plan of such election.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A notification to the Secretary under clause (i) shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) for both the plan year upon which a cost exemption is sought and the year prior, the actual total costs of coverage with respect to mental health and substance use disorder benefits under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Confidentiality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A notification to the Secretary under clause (i) shall be confidential. The Secretary shall make available, upon request and on not more than an annual basis, an anonymous itemization of such notifications, that includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a breakdown of States by the size and type of employers submitting such notification; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a summary of the data received under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Audits by appropriate agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To determine compliance with this paragraph, the Secretary may audit the books and records of a group health plan or health insurance issuer relating to an exemption, including any actuarial reports prepared pursuant to subparagraph (C), during the 6 year period following the notification of such exemption under subparagraph (E). A State agency receiving a notification under subparagraph (E) may also conduct such an audit with respect to an exemption covered by such notification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Separate application to each option offered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a group health plan that offers a participant or beneficiary two or more benefit package options under the plan, the requirements of this section shall be applied separately with respect to each such option.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the manner in which the participant or beneficiary is covered under the plan changes, whether through a change in health insurance coverage or health insurance issuer, a change between health insurance coverage and self-insured coverage, or otherwise; and</p>
