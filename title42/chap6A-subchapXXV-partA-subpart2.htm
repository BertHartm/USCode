<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply in connection with any group health plan or health in<!-- PDFPage:1124 -->surance issuer in any case in which the decision to discharge the mother or her newborn child prior to the expiration of the minimum length of stay otherwise required under paragraph (1)(A) is made by an attending provider in consultation with the mother.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) deny to the mother or her newborn child eligibility, or continued eligibility, to enroll or to renew coverage under the terms of the plan, solely for the purpose of avoiding the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide monetary payments or rebates to mothers to encourage such mothers to accept less than the minimum protections available under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) penalize or otherwise reduce or limit the reimbursement of an attending provider because such provider provided care to an individual participant or beneficiary in accordance with this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide incentives (monetary or otherwise) to an attending provider to induce such provider to provide care to an individual participant or beneficiary in a manner inconsistent with this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) subject to subsection (c)(3) of this section, restrict benefits for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) of this section in a manner which is less favorable than the benefits provided for any preceding portion of such stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a mother who is a participant or beneficiary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to give birth in a hospital; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time following the birth of her child.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a group health plan or issuer from imposing deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing in relation to benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or newborn child under the plan (or under health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan), except that such coinsurance or other cost-sharing for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) of this section may not be greater than such coinsurance or cost-sharing for any preceding portion of such stay.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A group health plan under this part shall comply with the notice requirement under section 1185(d) of title 29 with respect to the requirements of this section as if such section applied to such plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Preemption; exception for health insurance coverage in certain States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of this section shall not apply with respect to health insurance coverage if there is a State law (as defined in section 300gg&ndash;23(d)(1) of this title) for a State that regulates such coverage that is described in any of the following subparagraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Such State law requires such coverage to provide for at least a 48-hour hospital length of stay following a normal vaginal delivery and at least a 96-hour hospital length of stay following a cesarean section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such State law requires such coverage to provide for maternity and pediatric care in accordance with guidelines established by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or other established professional medical associations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Such State law requires, in connection with such coverage for maternity care, that the hospital length of stay for such care is left to the decision of (or required to be made by) the attending provider in consultation with the mother.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 300gg&ndash;23(a)(1) of this title shall not be construed as superseding a State law described in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) apply the applicable lifetime limit both to the medical and surgical benefits to which it otherwise would apply and to mental health benefits and not distinguish in the application of such limit between such medical and surgical benefits and mental health benefits; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not include any aggregate lifetime limit on mental health benefits that is less than the applicable lifetime limit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Rule in case of different limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan or coverage that is not described in subparagraph (A) or (B) and that includes no or different aggregate lifetime limits on different categories of medical and surgical benefits, the Secretary shall establish rules under which subparagraph (B) is applied to such plan or coverage with respect to mental health benefits by substituting for the applicable lifetime limit an average aggregate lifetime limit that is computed taking into account the weighted average of the aggregate lifetime limits applicable to such categories.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides both medical and surgical benefits and mental health benefits&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as requiring a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) to provide any mental health benefits; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with such a plan) that provides mental health benefits, as affecting the terms and conditions (including cost sharing, limits on numbers of visits or days of coverage, and requirements relating to medical necessity) relating to the amount, duration, or scope of mental health benefits under the plan or coverage, except as specifically provided in subsection (a) of this section (in regard to parity in the imposition of aggregate lifetime limits and annual limits for mental health benefits).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall not apply with respect to a group health plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan) if the application of this section to such plan (or to such coverage) results in an <!-- PDFPage:1126 -->increase in the cost under the plan (or for such coverage) of at least 1 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Separate application to each option offered</h4>
