<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12844, Apr. 21, 1993, 58 F.R. 21885, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 12974, &sect;3(b), Sept. 29, 1995, 60 F.R. 51876, which required the Federal Government to institute a Federal fleet vehicle acquisition program and established the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force to advise on implementation of the program, was revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 13031, &sect;9, Dec. 13, 1996, 61 F.R. 66531, set out below.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13031. Federal Alternative Fueled Vehicle Leadership</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13031, Dec. 13, 1996, 61 F.R. 66529, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the Energy Policy and Conservation Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 6201 <em>et seq</em>.), the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&ndash;486) (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;) [see Tables for classification], and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and with the knowledge that the use of alternative fueled motor vehicles will, in many applications, reduce the Nation's dependence on oil, and may create jobs by providing an economic stimulus for domestic industry, and may improve the Nation's air quality by reducing pollutants in the atmosphere, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Federal Leadership and Goals</em>. (a) The purpose of this order is to ensure that the Federal Government exercise leadership in the use of alternative fueled vehicles (AFVs). To that end, each Federal agency shall develop and implement aggressive plans to fulfill the alternative fueled vehicle acquisition requirements established by the Act. The Act generally requires that, of the vehicles acquired by each agency for its fleets, subject to certain conditions specified in section 303(b)(1) of the Act [42 U.S.C. 13212(b)(1)], 25 percent should be AFVs in fiscal year (FY) 1996, 33 percent in FY 1997, 50 percent in FY 1998, and 75 percent in FY 1999 and thereafter. These requirements apply to all agencies, regardless of whether they lease vehicles from the General Services Administration (GSA) or acquire them elsewhere. That section also defines which Federal agency vehicles are covered by the AFV acquisition requirements; this order applies to the same vehicles, which are primarily general-use vehicles located in metropolitan statistical areas with populations of 250,000 or more.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) To the extent practicable, agencies shall use alternative fuels in all vehicles capable of using them. Agencies shall continue to work together in interagency committees recommended by the Federal Fleet Conversion Task Force established by Executive Order 12844 of April 21, 1993, to coordinate their vehicle acquisitions and placement.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Submission of Agency Plans and Reports on Statutory Compliance</em>. (a) Sixty (60) days after the date of this Executive order, and annually thereafter as part of its budget submission to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, each agency shall submit a report on its compliance with sections 303 and 304 of the Act [42 U.S.C. 13212, 13213]. A copy of the report shall also be submitted to the Secretary of Energy and to the Administrator of General Services. The report shall state whether the agency is in compliance with the Act, and substantiate that statement with quantitative data including numbers and types of vehicles acquired and the level of their use. At a minimum, the report shall indicate the number of vehicles acquired or converted for each fuel type and vehicle class, and the total number of vehicles of each fuel type operated by the agency. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall issue further reporting guidance as necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If an agency has failed to meet the statutory requirements, it shall include in its report an explanation for such failure and a plan, consistent with the agency's current and requested budgets, for achieving compliance with the Act. The plan shall include alternative sources of suitable AFVs if the agency's primary vehicle supplier is unable to meet the AFV requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Secretary of the Department of Energy and the Administrator of General Services shall cooperatively analyze the agency AFV reports and acquisition plans, and shall submit jointly a summary report to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Exceptions for Law-Enforcement, Emergency, and National Defense Vehicles</em>. Section 303 of the Act [42 U.S.C. 13212] allows exemptions to the acquisition requirements for law-enforcement, emergency, and vehicles acquired and used for military purposes that the Secretary of Defense has certified must be exempt for national security reasons. Law enforcement vehicles shall include vehicles used for protective activities. Each agency that acquires or utilizes any such vehicles shall include in its report an explanation of why an exemption is claimed with respect to such vehicles.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Fulfilling the Acquisition Requirement</em>. (a) Agencies may acquire alternative fueled vehicles to meet the requirements of this order through lease from GSA, acquisition of original equipment manufacturer models, commercial lease, conversion of conventionally fueled vehicles, or any combination of these approaches. All vehicles, including those converted for alternative fuel use, shall comply with all applicable Federal and State emissions and safety standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Based on its own plans and the plans and reports submitted by other agencies, the Administrator of General Services shall provide planning information to potential AFV suppliers to assist in production planning. After consulting with AFV suppliers, the Administrator of General Services shall provide to Federal agencies information on the production plans of AFV suppliers well in advance of budget and ordering cycles.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) As required by section 305 of the Act [42 U.S.C. 13214], the Secretary of Energy, in cooperation with the Administrator of General Services, shall continue to provide technical assistance to other Federal agencies that acquire alternative fueled vehicles and shall facilitate the coordination of the Federal Government's alternative fueled vehicle program.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Vehicle Reporting Credits</em>. The gains in air quality and energy security that this order seeks to achieve will be even larger if medium- and heavy-duty vehicles are operated on alternative fuels, and if &ldquo;zero-emissions vehicles&rdquo; (ZEVs) are used. Therefore, for the purposes of this order, agencies may acquire medium- or heavy-duty dedicated alternative fueled vehicles or ZEVs to meet their AFV acquisition requirements, and they shall be given credits for compliance with their AFV targets as follows. Each medium-duty and ZEV shall count the same as two light-duty AFVs, and each dedicated alternative fueled heavy-duty vehicle shall count as three light-duty AFVs. The ZEV credits may be combined with vehicle size credits. The Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, shall issue detailed guidance on the classification and reporting of medium-duty, heavy-duty, and ZEVs. In the reports mandated in section 2 of this order, medium- and heavy-duty AFVs and ZEVs shall be identified separately from light-duty vehicles.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Funding Alternative Fueled Vehicle Acquisition</em>. (a) The Department of Energy will no longer request or require specific appropriations to fund the incremental costs of alternative fueled vehicles, including any incremental costs associated with acquisition and dis<!-- PDFPage:5780 -->posal, for other agencies. Agencies shall formulate their compliance plans based on existing and requested funds, but shall not be exempt from the requirements of the Act or this order due to limited appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) An exception regarding funding assistance shall be made for electric vehicles, which are in an earlier stage of development than other alternative fueled vehicles. The Secretary of Energy shall establish a program beginning in FY 1997 to provide partial funding assistance for agency purchases of electric vehicles. Up to $10,000 or one-half the incremental cost over a comparable gasoline-powered vehicle, whichever is less, may be provided as funding assistance for each electric vehicle, subject to the availability of funds.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Agency Cooperation with Stakeholders on Alternative Fueled Vehicle Placement and Refueling Capabilities</em>. The Secretary of Energy shall work with agencies procuring AFVs to coordinate the placement of their vehicles with the placement of similar vehicles by nonfederal alternative fuel stakeholders. Federal planning and acquisition efforts shall be coordinated with the efforts of the Department of Energy's &ldquo;Clean Cities&rdquo; participants, private industry fuel suppliers, and fleet operators, and State and local governments to ensure that adequate private sector refueling capabilities exist or will exist wherever Federal fleet alternative fueled vehicles are located. Each agency's fleet managers shall work with appropriate organizations at their respective locations, whether in a &ldquo;Clean Cities&rdquo; location or not, on initiatives to promote alternative fueled vehicle use and expansion of refueling infrastructure.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. <em>Definitions</em>. For the purpose of this order, the terms &ldquo;agency,&rdquo; &ldquo;alternative fueled vehicle,&rdquo; and &ldquo;alternative fuel&rdquo; have the same meaning given such terms in sections 151 and 301 of the Act [42 U.S.C. 8262, 13211].</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>Executive Order 12844</em>. This order supersedes Executive Order 12844.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. <em>Judicial Review</em>. This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>

The Secretary may, if appropriate, and pursuant to a rule under subsection (g) of this section, establish a lesser percentage requirement for any model year. The Secretary may, by rule, establish a date later than 2002 <!-- PDFPage:5791 -->(when model year 2003 begins) for initiating the fleet requirements under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed as requiring any fleet to acquire alternative fueled vehicles or alternative fuels that do not meet the normal business requirements and practices and needs of that fleet.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A vehicle operating only on gasoline that complies with applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.] shall not be considered an alternative fueled vehicle under subsection (b) of this section or this subsection, except that the Secretary, as part of the rule under subsection (b) of this section or this subsection, may determine that such vehicle should be treated as an alternative fueled vehicle for purposes of this section, for fleets subject to part C of title II of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7581 et seq.], taking into consideration the impact on energy security and the goals stated in section 13252(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Extension of deadlines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, by notice published in the Federal Register, extend the deadlines established under subsections (e), (f)(2), and (g) of this section for an additional 90 days if the Secretary is unable to meet such deadlines. Such extension shall not be reviewable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A rule issued under subsection (b), (g), or (<em>o</em>) of this section shall provide for the prompt exemption by the Secretary, through a simple and reasonable process, of any fleet from the requirements of subsection (b), (g), or (<em>o</em>) of this section, in whole or in part, if it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) alternative fueled vehicles that meet the normal requirements and practices of the principal business of the fleet owner are not reasonably available for acquisition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) alternative fuels that meet the normal requirements and practices of the principal business of the fleet owner are not available in the area in which the vehicles are to be operated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of State and local government entities, the application of such requirements would pose an unreasonable financial hardship.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of private fleets, if the motor vehicles, when under normal operations, are garaged at personal residences at night, such motor vehicles shall be exempt from the requirements of subsections (b) and (g).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Conversions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter or the amendments made by this subchapter shall require a fleet owner to acquire conversion vehicles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Inclusion of law enforcement vehicles and urban buses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary determines, by rule, that the inclusion of fleets of law enforcement motor vehicles in the fleet requirement program established under subsection (g) of this section would contribute to achieving the goal described in section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title, as modified under section 13254 of this title, and the Secretary finds that such inclusion would not hinder the use of the motor vehicles for law enforcement purposes, the Secretary may include such fleets in such program. The Secretary may only initiate one rulemaking under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines, by rule, that the inclusion of new urban buses, as defined by the Administrator under title II of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7521 et seq.], in a fleet requirement program established under subsection (g) of this section would contribute to achieving the goal described in section 13252(b)(2)(B) of this title, as modified under section 13254 of this title, the Secretary may include such urban buses in such program, if the Secretary finds that such application will be consistent with energy security goals and the needs and objectives of encouraging and facilitating the greater use of such urban buses by the public, taking into consideration the impact of such application on public transit entities. The Secretary may only initiate one rulemaking under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Rulemakings under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be separate from a rulemaking under subsection (g) of this section, but may not occur unless a rulemaking is carried out under subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Consideration of factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall take into consideration energy security, costs, safety, lead time requirements, vehicle miles traveled annually, effect on greenhouse gases, technological feasibility, energy requirements, economic impacts, including impacts on workers and the impact on consumers (including users of the alternative fuel for purposes such as for residences, agriculture, process use, and non-fuel purposes) and fleets, the availability of alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles, and other relevant factors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Consultation and participation of other Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out this section and section 13256 of this title, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Transportation, the Administrator, and other appropriate Federal agencies. The Secretary shall provide for the participation of the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator in the development and issuance of the rule under this section, including the public process concerning such rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Petitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As part of the rule promulgated either pursuant to subsection (b) or (g) of this section, the Secretary shall establish procedures for any fleet owner or operator or motor vehicle manufacturer to request that the Secretary modify or suspend a fleet requirement program established under either subsection nationally, by region, or in an applicable fleet area because, as demonstrated by the petitioner, the infrastructure or fuel supply or distribution system for an applicable alternative fuel is inadequate to meet the needs of a fleet. In the event that the Secretary determines that a modification or suspension of the fleet requirement program on a regional basis would detract from the nationwide character of any fleet requirement program established by rule or would sufficiently dimin<!-- PDFPage:5792 -->ish the economies of scale for the production of alternative fueled vehicles or alternative fuels and thereafter the practicability and effectiveness of such program, the Secretary may only modify or suspend the program nationally. The procedures shall include provisions for notice and public hearings. The Secretary shall deny or grant the petition within 180 days after filing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Mandatory State fleet programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Pursuant to a rule promulgated by the Secretary, beginning in calendar year 1995 (when model year 1996 begins), the following percentages of new light duty motor vehicles acquired annually for State government fleets, including agencies thereof, but not municipal fleets, shall be alternative fueled vehicles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 10 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 1996;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 15 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 1997;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 25 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 1998;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 50 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 1999;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) 75 percent of the motor vehicles acquired in model year 2000 and thereafter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall within 18 months after October 24, 1992, promulgate a rule providing that a State may submit a plan within 12 months after such promulgation containing a light duty alternative fueled vehicle plan for State fleets to meet the annual percentages established under paragraph (1) for the acquisition of light duty motor vehicles. The plan shall provide for the voluntary conversion or acquisition or combination thereof, beyond any acquisition required by this subchapter, of such motor vehicles by State, local, or private fleets, in numbers greater than or equal to the number of State alternative fueled vehicles required pursuant to paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The plan, if approved by the Secretary, would be in lieu of the State meeting such annual percentages solely through purchases of new State-owned vehicles. All conversions or acquisitions or combinations thereof of any alternative fueled vehicles under the plan must be voluntary and must conform with the requirements of section 247 of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7587] and must comply with applicable safety requirements. The Secretary of Transportation shall within 3 years after enactment promulgate rules setting forth safety standards in accordance with chapter 301 of title 49 applicable to all conversions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the request of a fleet or covered person allocated a credit under this section, the Secretary shall treat the credit as the acquisition of one alternative fueled vehicle of the type for which the credit is allocated in the year designated by that fleet or person when determining whether that fleet or person has complied with this subchapter in the year designated. A credit may be counted toward compliance for only one year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transferability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fleet or covered person allocated a credit under this section or to whom a credit is transferred under this section, may transfer freely the credit to another fleet or person who is required to comply with this subchapter. At the request of the fleet or person to whom a credit is transferred, the Secretary shall treat the transferred credit as the acquisition of one alternative fueled vehicle of the type for which the credit is allocated in the year designated by the fleet or person to whom the credit is transferred when determining whether that fleet or person has complied with this subchapter in the <!-- PDFPage:5793 -->year designated. A transferred credit may be counted toward compliance for only one year.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;13368. Ownership of coalbed methane</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Federal lands and mineral rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any deposit of coalbed methane where the United States is the owner of the surface estate or where the United States has transferred the surface estate but reserved the subsurface mineral estate, the Secretary of the Interior shall administer this section. This section and the definitions contained herein shall be applicable only on lands within Affected States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Affected States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 180 days after October 24, 1992, the Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, shall publish in the Federal Register a list of Affected States which shall be comprised of States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in which the Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, determines that disputes, uncertainty, or litigation exist, regarding the ownership of coalbed methane gas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in which the Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, determines that development of significant deposits of coalbed methane gas is being impeded by such existing disputes, uncertainty, or litigation regarding ownership of such coalbed methane;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) which do not have in effect a statutory or regulatory procedure or existing case law permitting and encouraging the development of coalbed methane gas within that State; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5812 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) which do not have extensive development of coalbed methane gas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, shall revise such list of Affected States from time to time. Any Affected State shall be deleted from the list of Affected States upon the receipt by the Secretary of the Interior of a Governor's petition requesting such deletion, a State law requesting such deletion, or a resolution requesting such deletion enacted by the legislative body of the State. A Governor intending to petition the Secretary of the Interior to delete a State from the list of Affected States shall provide the State's legislative body with 6 months notice of such petition during a legislative session. At the end of such 6-month period, the Governor may petition the Secretary of the Interior to delete a State from the list of Affected States, unless during such 6-month period, the State's legislative body has enacted a law or resolution disapproving the Governor's petition. Until the Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, publishes a different list, the States of West Virginia, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana, and Illinois shall be the Affected States, effective on October 24, 1992. The States of Colorado, Montana, New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah, Virginia, Washington, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama shall not be included on the Secretary of the Interior's list of Affected States or any extension or revision thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Failure to adopt statutory or regulatory procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an Affected State has not placed in effect, by statute or by regulation, a substantial program promoting the permitting, drilling and production of coalbed methane wells (including pooling arrangements) within that State within 3 years after becoming an Affected State, the Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, shall administer this section and shall promulgate such regulations as are necessary to carry out this section in that State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Implementation by Secretary of the Interior</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In implementing this section, the Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consider existing and future coal mining plans,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) preserve the mineability of coal seams, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide for the prevention of waste and maximization of recovery of coal and coalbed methane gas in a manner which will protect the rights of all entities owning an interest in such coalbed methane resource.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Spacing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except where State law in an Affected State contains existing spacing requirements regarding the minimum distance between coalbed methane wells and the minimum distance of a coalbed methane well from a property line, the Secretary of the Interior shall establish such requirements within 90 days after the assertion of jurisdiction pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Spacing units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Applications to establish spacing units for the drilling and operation of coalbed methane gas wells may be filed by any entity claiming a coalbed methane ownership interest within a proposed spacing unit. Upon receipt and approval of an application, the Secretary of the Interior shall issue an order establishing the boundaries of the coalbed methane spacing unit. Spacing units shall generally be uniform in size.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Development under pooling arrangement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Following issuance of an order establishing a spacing unit under subsection (f) of this section, and pursuant to an application for pooling filed by the entity claiming a coalbed methane ownership interest and proposing to drill a coalbed methane gas well, the Secretary of the Interior shall hold a hearing to consider the application for pooling and shall, if the criteria of this section are met, issue an order allowing the proposed pooling of acreage within the designated spacing unit for purposes of drilling and production of coalbed methane from the spacing unit. The pooling order shall not be issued before notice or a reasonable and diligent effort to provide notice has been made to each entity which may claim an ownership interest in the coalbed methane gas within such spacing unit and each such entity has been offered an opportunity to appear before the Secretary of the Interior at the hearing. Upon issuance of a pooling order, each owner or claimant of an ownership interest shall be allowed to make one of the following elections:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An election to sell or lease its coalbed methane ownership interest to the unit operator at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Interior as set forth in the pooling order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An election to become a participating working interest owner by bearing a share of the risks and costs of drilling, completing, equipping, gathering, operating (including all disposal costs), plugging and abandoning the well, and receiving a share of production from the well.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An election to share in the operation of the well as a nonparticipating working interest owner by relinquishing its working interest to participating working interest owners until the proceeds allocable to its share equal 300 percent of the share of such costs allocable to its interest. Thereafter, the nonparticipating working interest owner shall become a participating working interest owner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The pooling order shall designate a unit operator who shall be authorized to drill and operate the spacing unit. The pooling order shall provide that any entity claiming an ownership interest in the coalbed methane within such spacing unit which does not make an election under the pooling order shall be deemed to have leased its coalbed methane interest to the unit operator under such terms and conditions as the pooling order may provide. No pooling order may be issued under this paragraph for any spacing unit if all entities claiming an ownership interest in the coalbed methane in the spacing unit have entered into a voluntary agreement providing for the drilling and operation of the coalbed methane gas well for the spacing unit.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5813 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Escrow account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each pooling order issued under subsection (g) of this section shall provide for the establishment of an escrow account into which the payment of costs and proceeds attributable to the conflicting interests shall be deposited and held for the interest of the claimants as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Each participating working interest owner, except for the unit operator, shall deposit in the escrow account its proportionate share of the costs allocable to the ownership interest claimed by each such participating working interest owner as set forth in the pooling order issued by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The unit operator shall deposit in the escrow account all proceeds attributable to the conflicting interests of lessees, plus all proceeds in excess of ongoing operational expenses (including reasonable overhead costs) attributable to conflicting working interests.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Interior shall order payment of principal and accrued interest from the escrow account to all legally entitled entities within 30 days of receipt by the Secretary of the Interior of notification of the final legal determination of entitlement or upon agreement of all entities claiming an ownership interest in the coalbed methane gas. Upon such final determination&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each legally entitled participating working interest owner shall receive a proportionate share of the proceeds attributable to the conflicting ownership interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) each legally entitled nonparticipating working interest owner shall receive a proportionate share of the proceeds attributable to the conflicting ownership interest, less the cost of being carried as a nonparticipating working interest owner (as determined by the election of the entity under the applicable pooling order);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) each entity leasing (or deemed to have leased) its coalbed methane ownership interest to the unit operator shall receive a share of the royalty proceeds (as set out in the applicable pooling order) attributable to the conflicting interests of lessees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the unit operator shall receive the costs contributed to the escrow account by each legally entitled participating working interest owner.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary of the Interior shall enact rules and regulations for the administration and protection of funds delivered to the escrow accounts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Approval of Secretary of the Interior</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No entity may drill any well for the production of coalbed methane gas from a coal seam, subject to the provisions of subsection (g) of this section, in an Affected State unless the drilling of such well has been approved by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Authorization to stimulate coal seam</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No operator of a coalbed methane well may stimulate a coal seam without the written consent of each entity which, at the time that the coalbed methane operator applies for a drilling permit, is operating a coal mine, or has by virtue of his property rights in the coal the ability to operate a coal mine, located within a horizontal or vertical distance from the point of stimulation as established by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection. In seeking the coal operator's consent, a coalbed methane well operator shall provide the coal operator with necessary information about such stimulation, including relevant information to ensure compliance with coal mine safety laws and rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the absence of a written consent pursuant to paragraph (1) and at the request of a coalbed methane operator, the Secretary of the Interior shall make a determination regarding stimulation of a coal seam. Such request shall include an affidavit which shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) state that an entity from which consent is required pursuant to paragraph (1) has refused to provide written consent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) set forth in detail the efforts undertaken by the applicant to obtain such written consent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) state the known reasons for the consent not being provided;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) set forth the conditions and compensation, if any, offered by the applicant as part of the efforts to obtain consent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) provide prima facie evidence that the method of stimulation proposed by the coalbed methane operator will not (i) cause unreasonable loss or damage to the coal seam considering all factors, including the prospect, taking into consideration the economics of the coal industry, that coal seams for which no actual or proposed mining plans exist will be mined at some future date, or (ii) violate mine safety requirements. If a denial of consent by a coal operator is based on reasons related to safety, the Secretary of the Interior shall seek the views and recommendations of the appropriate State or Federal coal mine safety agency. Any determination by the Secretary of the Interior shall be in accordance with all applicable Federal and State coal mine safety laws and such views and recommendations. A determination by the Secretary of the Interior approving a method of stimulation may include reasonable conditions including, but not limited to, conditions to mitigate, to the extent practicable, economic damage to the coal seam. Any determination approving or denying a method of stimulation by the Secretary of the Interior shall be subject to appeal. Interested entities shall be allowed to participate in and comment on proceedings under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of the Interior shall by rule establish, for an Affected State, a region thereof, or a multi-State region comprised of Affected States, the boundaries within which a coalbed methane operator shall be required to obtain written consent from a coal operator pursuant to paragraph (1). Such boundaries shall be stated in terms of a horizontal and a vertical distance from the point of stimulation and shall be determined based on an evaluation of the maximum length, height and depth of fracture producible in a coal seam in such Affected State, region thereof, or multi-State region comprised of Affected States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5814 --><p class="statutory-body">(4) The consent required under this subsection shall in no way be deemed to impair, abridge, or affect any contractual rights or objections arising out of a coalbed methane gas contract or coalbed methane gas lease in existence as of October 24, 1992,<sup><a href="#13368_1_target" name="13368_1">1</a></sup> between the coalbed methane operator and the coal operator, and the existence of such lease or contractual agreement and any extensions or renewals of such lease shall be deemed to fully meet the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing in this subsection precludes either a coal operator or a coalbed methane operator from seeking in the appropriate State forum compensation for the consequences of a determination by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Notice and objection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Interior shall not approve the drilling of any coalbed methane well unless the unit operator has notified each entity which is operating, or has the ability, by virtue of his property rights in the coal, to operate, a coal mine in any portion of the coalbed that would be affected by such well within the distances established pursuant to the rules promulgated under subsection (j)(3) of this section. Any notified entity may object to the drilling of such well within 30 days after receipt of a notice. Upon receipt of a timely objection to the drilling of any coalbed methane gas well submitted by a notified entity, the Secretary of the Interior may refuse to approve the drilling of the well based on any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The proposed activity, due to its proximity to any coal mine opening, shaft, underground workings, or to any proposed extension of the coal mine, would adversely affect any operating, inactive or abandoned coal mine, including any coal mine already surveyed and platted but not yet being operated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The proposed activity would not conform with a coal operator's development plan for an existing or proposed operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) There would be an unreasonable interference from the proposed activity with present or future coal mining operations, including the ability to comply with other applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The presence of evidence indicating that the proposed drilling activities would be unsafe, taking into consideration the dangers from creeps, squeezes or other disturbances due to the extraction of coal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The proposed activity would unreasonably interfere with the safe recovery of coal, oil and gas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event the Secretary of the Interior does not approve the drilling of a coalbed methane well pursuant to paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Interior shall consider whether such drilling could be approved if the unit operator modifies the proposed activities to take into account any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The proposed activity could instead be reasonably done through an existing or planned pillar of coal, or in close proximity to an existing well or such pillar of coal, taking into consideration surface topography.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The proposed activity could instead be moved to a mined-out area, below the coal outcrop or to some other feasible area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The unit operator agrees to a drilling moratorium of not more than two years in order to permit completion of coal mining operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The practicality of locating the proposed spacing unit or well on a uniform pattern with other spacing units or wells.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Plugging</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All coalbed methane wells drilled after October 24, 1992, that penetrate coal seams with remaining reserves shall provide for subsequent safe mining through the well in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior, in consultation with any Federal and State agencies having authority over coal mine safety. Well plugging costs should be allocated in accordance with State law or private contractual arrangement, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Notice and objection by other parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior shall not approve the drilling of any coalbed methane well unless such well complies with the spacing and other requirements established by the Secretary of the Interior and each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The unit operator of such well has notified, or has made a reasonable and diligent effort to notify, all entities claiming ownership of coalbed methane to be drained by such well and provided an opportunity to object in accordance with requirements established by the Secretary of the Interior.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Where conflicting interests exist, an order under subsection (g) of this section establishing pooling requirements has been issued.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The notification requirements of this subsection shall be additional to the notification referred to in subsection (k) of this section. The Secretary of the Interior shall establish the conditions under which entities claiming ownership of coalbed methane may object to the drilling of a coalbed methane well.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Venting for safety</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent or inhibit the entity which has the right to develop and mine coal in any mine from venting coalbed methane gas to ensure safe mine operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Interior shall comply with all applicable Federal and State coal mine safety laws and regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;Affected State&rdquo; means a State listed by the Secretary of the Interior, with the participation of the Secretary of Energy, under subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) when developing their respective energy infrastructures, countries in the Western Hemisphere must consider existing and emerging environmental constraints, and do so in a way that results in sustainable long-term economic growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the coordination of respective national energy and environmental policies of the governments of the Western Hemisphere could be substantially improved through regular consultation among these countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the development, production and consumption of energy can affect environmental quality, and the environmental consequences of energy-related activities are not confined within national boundaries, but are regional and global in scope;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) although the Western Hemisphere is richly endowed with indigenous energy resources, an insufficient energy supply would severely constrain future opportunities for sustainable economic development and growth in each of these member countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the energy markets of the United States are linked with those in other countries of the Western Hemisphere and the world.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; defined</h4>
