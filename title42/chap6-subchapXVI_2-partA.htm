<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period for determination of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An individual's eligibility for a benefit under this subchapter for a month shall be determined on the basis of the individual's (and eligible spouse's, if any) income, resources, and other relevant characteristics in such month, and, except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), the amount of such benefit shall be determined for such month on the basis of income and other characteristics in the first or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, second month preceding such month. Eligibility for and the amount of such benefits shall be redetermined at such time or times as may be provided by the Commissioner of Social Security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of such benefit for the month in which an application for benefits becomes effective (or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, for such month and the following month) and for any month immediately following a month of ineligibility for such benefits (or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, for such month and the following month) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be determined on the basis of the income of the individual and the eligible spouse, if any, of such individual and other relevant circumstances in such month; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of the month in which an application becomes effective or the first month following a period of ineligibility, if such application becomes effective, or eligibility is restored, after the first day of such month, bear the same ratio to the amount of the benefit which would have been payable to such individual if such application had become effective, or eligibility had been restored, on the first day of such month as the number of days in such month including and following the effective date of such application or restoration of eligibility bears to the total number of days in such month.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, an increase in the benefit amount payable under subchapter II of this chapter (over the amount payable in the preceding month, or, at the election of the Commissioner of Social Security, the second preceding month) to an individual receiving benefits under this subchapter shall be included in the income used to determine the benefit under this subchapter of such individual for any month which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the first month in which the benefit amount payable to such individual under this title is increased pursuant to section 1382f of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at the election of the Commissioner of Social Security, the month immediately following such month.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that reliable information is currently available with respect to the income and other circumstances of an individual for a month (including information with respect to a class of which such individual is a member and information with respect to scheduled cost-of-living adjustments under other benefit programs), the benefit amount of such individual under this subchapter for such month may be determined on the basis of such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe by regulation the circumstances in which information with respect to an event may be taken into account pursuant to subparagraph (A) in determining benefit amounts under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), any income which is paid to or on behalf of an individual in any month pursuant to (A) a State program funded under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter, (B) section 672 of this title (relating to foster care assistance), (C) section 1522(e) of title 8 (relating to assistance for refugees), (D) section 501(a) of Public Law 96-422 (relating to assistance for Cuban and Haitian entrants), or (E) section 13 of title 25 (relating to assistance furnished by the Bureau of Indian Affairs), shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under this subchapter of such individual (and his eligible spouse, if any) only for that month, and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit for any other month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The dollar amount in effect under subsection (b) of this section as a result of any increase in benefits under this subchapter by reason of section 1382f of this title shall be used to determine the value of any in-kind support and maintenance required to be taken into account in determining the benefit payable under this subchapter to an individual (and the eligible spouse, if any, of the individual) for the 1st 2 months for which the increase in benefits applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, an application of an individual for benefits under this subchapter shall be effective on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the first day of the month following the date such application is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day of the month following the date such individual becomes eligible for such benefits with respect to such application.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Commissioner of Social Security may waive the limitations specified in subparagraphs <!-- PDFPage:1552 -->(A) and (B) of subsection (e)(1) of this section on an individual's eligibility and benefit amount for a month (to the extent either such limitation is applicable by reason of such individual's presence throughout such month in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility) if such waiver would promote the individual's removal from such institution or facility. Upon waiver of such limitations, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply, to the month preceding the month of removal, or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, the two months preceding the month of removal, the benefit rate that is appropriate to such individual's living arrangement subsequent to his removal from such institution or facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on amount of gross income earned; &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe the circumstances under which, consistently with the purposes of this subchapter, the gross income from a trade or business (including farming) will be considered sufficiently large to make an individual ineligible for benefits under this subchapter. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; has the same meaning as when used in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of an individual who has an eligible spouse, if only one of them is in such a hospital, home or facility throughout such month, at a rate not in excess of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the rate of $360 per year (reduced by the amount of any income, not excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title, of the one who is in such hospital, home, or facility), and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subsection, a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility which is a &ldquo;medical institution or nursing facility&rdquo; within the meaning of section 1396p(c) of this title shall be considered to be receiving payments with respect to an individual under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter during any period of ineligibility of such individual provided for under the State plan pursuant to section 1396p(c) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G) A person may be an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter, and subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply, with respect to any particular month throughout which he or she is an inmate of a public institution the primary purpose of which is the provision of medical or psychiatric care, or <!-- PDFPage:1553 -->which is a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility receiving payments (with respect to such individual or spouse) under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter, if it is determined in accordance with subparagraph (H) that&mdash;</p>

Such procedures and agreements shall include the provision of appropriate assistance to individuals who, because of their physical or mental condition, are limited in their ability to furnish the information needed in connection with the making of such determinations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I)(i) The Commissioner shall enter into an agreement, with any interested State or local institution described in clause (i) or (ii) of section 402(x)(1)(A) of this title the primary purpose of which is to confine individuals as described in section 402(x)(1)(A) of this title, under which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the criteria being used by the Commissioner of Social Security in determining when a husband and wife are to be considered two eligible individuals for purposes of this subchapter and when they are to be considered an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, the State agency administering or supervising the administration of a State plan under any other program under this chapter may (in the administration of such plan) treat a husband and wife living in the same hospital, home, or facility described in paragraph (1)(B) as though they were an eligible individual with his or her eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter (rather than two eligible individuals), after they have continuously lived in the same such hospital, home, or facility for 6 months, if treating such husband and wife as two eligible individuals would prevent either of them from receiving benefits or assistance under such plan or reduce the amount thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) No person shall be considered an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter during the 10-year period that begins on the date the person is convicted in Federal or State court of having made a fraudulent statement or representation with respect to the place of residence of the person in order to receive assistance simultaneously from 2 or more States under programs that are funded under subchapter IV of this chapter, subchapter XIX of this chapter, or the Food Stamp Act of 1977 [7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], or benefits in 2 or more States under the supplemental security income program under this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) other property which is so essential to the means of self-support of such individual (and such spouse) as to warrant its exclusion, as determined in accordance with and subject to limitations prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security, except that the Commissioner of Social Security shall not establish a limitation on property (including the tools of a tradesperson and the machinery and livestock of a farmer) that is used in a trade or business or by such individual as an employee;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining the resources of an individual (or eligible spouse) an insurance policy shall be taken into account only to the extent of its cash surrender value; except that if the total face value of all life insurance policies on any person is $1,500 or less, no part of the value of any such policy shall be taken into account.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disposition of resources; grounds for exemption from disposition requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe the period or periods of time within which, and the manner in which, various kinds of property must be disposed of in order not to be included in determining an individual's eligibility for benefits. Any portion of the individual's benefits paid for any such period shall be conditioned upon such disposal; and any benefits so paid shall (at the time of the disposal) be considered overpayments to the extent they would not have been paid had the disposal occurred at the beginning of the period for which such benefits were paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Commissioner of Social Security shall not require the disposition of any real property for so long as it cannot be sold because (A) it is jointly owned (and its sale would cause undue hardship, due to loss of housing, for the other owner or owners), (B) its sale is barred by a legal impediment, or (C) as determined under regulations issued by the Commissioner of Social Security, the owner's reasonable efforts to sell it have been unsuccessful.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notification of medicaid policy restricting eligibility of institutionalized individuals for benefits based on disposal of resources for less than fair market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) At the time an individual (and the individual's eligible spouse, if any) applies for benefits under this subchapter, and at the time the eligibility of an individual (and such spouse, if any) for such benefits is redetermined, the Commissioner of Social Security shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) inform such individual of the provisions of section 1396p(c) of this title providing for a period of ineligibility for benefits under subchapter XIX of this chapter for individuals who make certain dispositions of resources for less than fair market value, and inform such individual that information obtained pursuant to subparagraph (B) will be made available to the State agency administering a State plan under subchapter XIX of this chapter (as provided in paragraph (2)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) obtain from such individual information which may be used by the State agency in determining whether or not a period of ineligibility for such benefits would be required by reason of section 1396p(c) of this title if such individual (or such spouse, if any) enters a medical institution or nursing facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commissioner of Social Security shall make the information obtained under paragraph (1)(B) available, on request, to any State agency administering a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funds set aside for burial expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In determining the resources of an individual, there shall be excluded an amount, not in excess of $1,500 each with respect to such individual and his spouse (if any), that is separately identifiable and has been set aside to meet the burial and related expenses of such individual or spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of $1,500, referred to in paragraph (1), with respect to an individual shall be reduced by an amount equal to (A) the total face value of all insurance policies on his life which are owned by him or his spouse and the cash surrender value of which has been excluded in determining the resources of such individual or of such individual and his spouse, and (B) the total of any amounts in an irrevocable trust (or other irrevocable arrangement) available to meet the burial and related expenses of such individual or his spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Commissioner of Social Security finds that any part of the amount excluded under paragraph (1) was used for purposes other than those for which it was set aside in cases where the inclusion of any portion of the amount would cause the resources of such individual, or of such individual and spouse, to exceed the limits specified in paragraph (1) or (2) (whichever may be applicable) of section 1382(a) of this title, the Commissioner shall reduce any future benefits payable to the eligible individual (or to such individual and his spouse) by an amount equal to such part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commissioner of Social Security may provide by regulations that whenever an amount set aside to meet burial and related expenses is excluded under paragraph (1) in determining the <!-- PDFPage:1571 -->resources of an individual, any interest earned or accrued on such amount (and left to accumulate), and any appreciation in the value of prepaid burial arrangements for which such amount was set aside, shall also be excluded (to such extent and subject to such conditions or limitations as such regulations may prescribe) in determining the resources (and the income) of such individual.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;aged, blind, or disabled individual&rdquo; means an individual who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is 65 years of age or older, is blind (as determined under paragraph (2)), or is disabled (as determined under paragraph (3)), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) is a resident of the United States, and is either (I) a citizen or (II) an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence or otherwise permanently residing in the United States under color of law (including any alien who is lawfully present in the United States as a result of the application of the provisions of section 1182(d)(5) of title 8), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is a child who is a citizen of the United States, who is living with a parent of the child who is a member of the Armed Forces of the United States assigned to permanent duty ashore outside the United States, and who, for the month before the parent reported for such assignment, received a benefit under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual shall be considered to be blind for purposes of this subchapter if he has central visual acuity of 20/200 or less in the better eye with the use of a correcting lens. An eye which is accompanied by a limitation in the fields of vision such that the widest diameter of the visual field subtends an angle no greater than 20 degrees shall be considered for purposes of the first sentence of this subsection as having a central visual acuity of 20/200 or less. An individual shall also be considered to be blind for purposes of this subchapter if he is blind as defined under a State plan approved under subchapter X or XVI of this chapter as in effect for October 1972 and received aid under such plan (on the basis of blindness) for December 1973, so long as he is continuously blind as so defined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), an individual shall be considered to be disabled <!-- PDFPage:1573 -->for purposes of this subchapter if he is unable to engage in any substantial gainful activity by reason of any medically determinable physical or mental impairment which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than twelve months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), an individual shall be determined to be under a disability only if his physical or mental impairment or impairments are of such severity that he is not only unable to do his previous work but cannot, considering his age, education, and work experience, engage in any other kind of substantial gainful work which exists in the national economy, regardless of whether such work exists in the immediate area in which he lives, or whether a specific job vacancy exists for him, or whether he would be hired if he applied for work. For purposes of the preceding sentence (with respect to any individual), &ldquo;work which exists in the national economy&rdquo; means work which exists in significant numbers either in the region where such individual lives or in several regions of the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) An individual under the age of 18 shall be considered disabled for the purposes of this subchapter if that individual has a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, which results in marked and severe functional limitations, and which can be expected to result in death or which has lasted or can be expected to last for a continuous period of not less than 12 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), no individual under the age of 18 who engages in substantial gainful activity (determined in accordance with regulations prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (E)) may be considered to be disabled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, a physical or mental impairment is an impairment that results from anatomical, physiological, or psychological abnormalities which are demonstrable by medically acceptable clinical and laboratory diagnostic techniques.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The Commissioner of Social Security shall by regulations prescribe the criteria for determining when services performed or earnings derived from services demonstrate an individual's ability to engage in substantial gainful activity. In determining whether an individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of his earnings, where his disability is sufficiently severe to result in a functional limitation requiring assistance in order for him to work, there shall be excluded from such earnings an amount equal to the cost (to such individual) of any attendant care services, medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (not including routine drugs or routine medical services unless such drugs or services are necessary for the control of the disabling condition) which are necessary (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security in regulations) for that purpose, whether or not such assistance is also needed to enable him to carry out his normal daily functions; except that the amounts to be excluded shall be subject to such reasonable limits as the Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B), an individual whose services or earnings meet such criteria shall be found not to be disabled. The Commissioner of Social Security shall make determinations under this subchapter with respect to substantial gainful activity, without regard to the legality of the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (A) through (E), an individual shall also be considered to be disabled for purposes of this subchapter if he is permanently and totally disabled as defined under a State plan approved under subchapter XIV or XVI of this chapter as in effect for October 1972 and received aid under such plan (on the basis of disability) for December 1973 (and for at least one month prior to July 1973), so long as he is continuously disabled as so defined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) In determining whether an individual's physical or mental impairment or impairments are of a sufficient medical severity that such impairment or impairments could be the basis of eligibility under this section, the Commissioner of Social Security shall consider the combined effect of all of the individual's impairments without regard to whether any such impairment, if considered separately, would be of such severity. If the Commissioner of Social Security does find a medically severe combination of impairments, the combined impact of the impairments shall be considered throughout the disability determination process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) In making determinations with respect to disability under this subchapter, the provisions of sections 421(h), 421(k), and 423(d)(5) of this title shall apply in the same manner as they apply to determinations of disability under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) Not less frequently than once every 3 years, the Commissioner shall review in accordance with paragraph (4) the continued eligibility for benefits under this subchapter of each individual who has not attained 18 years of age and is eligible for such benefits by reason of an impairment (or combination of impairments) which is likely to improve (or, at the option of the Commissioner, which is unlikely to improve).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) A representative payee of a recipient whose case is reviewed under this clause shall present, at the time of review, evidence demonstrating that the recipient is, and has been, receiving treatment, to the extent considered medically necessary and available, of the condition which was the basis for providing benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) If the representative payee refuses to comply without good cause with the requirements of subclause (II), the Commissioner of Social Security shall, if the Commissioner determines it is in the best interest of the individual, promptly suspend payment of benefits to the representative payee, and provide for payment of benefits to an alternative representative payee of the individual or, if the interest of the individual under this subchapter would be served thereby, to the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) Subclause (II) shall not apply to the representative payee of any individual with respect to whom the Commissioner determines such application would be inappropriate or unnecessary. In making such determination, the Commis<!-- PDFPage:1574 -->sioner shall take into consideration the nature of the individual's impairment (or combination of impairments). Section 1383(c) of this title shall not apply to a finding by the Commissioner that the requirements of subclause (II) should not apply to an individual's representative payee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If an individual is eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability for the month preceding the month in which the individual attains the age of 18 years, the Commissioner shall redetermine such eligibility&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) during the 1-year period beginning on the individual's 18th birthday; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) by applying the criteria used in determining the initial eligibility for applicants who are age 18 or older.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">With respect to a redetermination under this clause, paragraph (4) shall not apply and such redetermination shall be considered a substitute for a review or redetermination otherwise required under any other provision of this subparagraph during that 1-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv)(I) Not later than 12 months after the birth of an individual, the Commissioner shall review in accordance with paragraph (4) the continuing eligibility for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability of such individual whose low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) A review under subclause (I) shall be considered a substitute for a review otherwise required under any other provision of this subparagraph during that 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) A representative payee of a recipient whose case is reviewed under this clause shall present, at the time of review, evidence demonstrating that the recipient is, and has been, receiving treatment, to the extent considered medically necessary and available, of the condition which was the basis for providing benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) If the representative payee refuses to comply without good cause with the requirements of subclause (III), the Commissioner of Social Security shall, if the Commissioner determines it is in the best interest of the individual, promptly suspend payment of benefits to the representative payee, and provide for payment of benefits to an alternative representative payee of the individual or, if the interest of the individual under this subchapter would be served thereby, to the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(V) Subclause (III) shall not apply to the representative payee of any individual with respect to whom the Commissioner determines such application would be inappropriate or unnecessary. In making such determination, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the nature of the individual's impairment (or combination of impairments). Section 1383(c) of this title shall not apply to a finding by the Commissioner that the requirements of subclause (III) should not apply to an individual's representative payee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I) In making any determination under this subchapter with respect to the disability of an individual who has not attained the age of 18 years and to whom section 421(h) of this title does not apply, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that a qualified pediatrician or other individual who specializes in a field of medicine appropriate to the disability of the individual (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security) evaluates the case of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(J) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), an individual shall not be considered to be disabled for purposes of this subchapter if alcoholism or drug addiction would (but for this subparagraph) be a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A recipient of benefits based on disability under this subchapter may be determined not to be entitled to such benefits on the basis of a finding that the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are provided has ceased, does not exist, or is not disabling only if such finding is supported by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an individual who is age 18 or older&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) substantial evidence which demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) there has been any medical improvement in the individual's impairment or combination of impairments (other than medical improvement which is not related to the individual's ability to work), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) substantial evidence (except in the case of an individual eligible to receive benefits under section 1382h of this title) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) consists of new medical evidence and a new assessment of the individual's residual functional capacity, and demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) although the individual has not improved medically, he or she is nonetheless a beneficiary of advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology (related to the individual's ability to work), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) although the individual has not improved medically, he or she has undergone vocational therapy (related to the individual's ability to work), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) substantial evidence which demonstrates that, as determined on the basis of new or improved diagnostic techniques or evaluations, the individual's impairment or combination of impairments is not as disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent prior decision that he or she was under a disability or continued to be under a disability, and that therefore the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an individual who is under the age of 18&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) substantial evidence which demonstrates that there has been medical improvement in the individual's impairment or <!-- PDFPage:1575 -->combination of impairments, and that such impairment or combination of impairments no longer results in marked and severe functional limitations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) substantial evidence which demonstrates that, as determined on the basis of new or improved diagnostic techniques or evaluations, the individual's impairment or combination of impairments, is not as disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent prior decision that the individual was under a disability or continued to be under a disability, and such impairment or combination of impairments does not result in marked and severe functional limitations; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of any individual, substantial evidence (which may be evidence on the record at the time any prior determination of the entitlement to benefits based on disability was made, or newly obtained evidence which relates to that determination) which demonstrates that a prior determination was in error.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a determination that an individual receiving benefits based on disability under this subchapter is entitled to such benefits if the prior determination was fraudulently obtained or if the individual is engaged in substantial gainful activity, cannot be located, or fails, without good cause, to cooperate in a review of his or her entitlement or to follow prescribed treatment which would be expected (i) to restore his or her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, or (ii) in the case of an individual under the age of 18, to eliminate or improve the individual's impairment or combination of impairments so that it no longer results in marked and severe functional limitations. Any determination under this paragraph shall be made on the basis of all the evidence available in the individual's case file, including new evidence concerning the individual's prior or current condition which is presented by the individual or secured by the Commissioner of Social Security. Any determination made under this paragraph shall be made on the basis of the weight of the evidence and on a neutral basis with regard to the individual's condition, without any initial inference as to the presence or absence of disability being drawn from the fact that the individual has previously been determined to be disabled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;eligible spouse&rdquo; means an aged, blind, or disabled individual who is the husband or wife of another aged, blind, or disabled individual, and who, in a month, is living with such aged, blind, or disabled individual on the first day of the month or, in any case in which either spouse files an application for benefits, on the first day of the month following the date the application is filed, or, in any case in which either spouse requests restoration of eligibility under this subchapter during the month, at the time the request is filed. If two aged, blind, or disabled individuals are husband and wife as described in the preceding sentence, only one of them may be an &ldquo;eligible individual&rdquo; within the meaning of section 1382(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; means an individual who is neither married nor (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security) the head of a household, and who is (1) under the age of eighteen, or (2) under the age of twenty-two and (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security) a student regularly attending a school, college, or university, or a course of vocational or technical training designed to prepare him for gainful employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In determining whether two individuals are husband and wife for purposes of this subchapter, appropriate State law shall be applied; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if a man and woman have been determined to be husband and wife under section 416(h)(1) of this title for purposes of subchapter II of this chapter they shall be considered (from and after the date of such determination or the date of their application for benefits under this subchapter, whichever is later) to be husband and wife for purposes of this subchapter, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a man and woman are found to be holding themselves out to the community in which they reside as husband and wife, they shall be so considered for purposes of this subchapter notwithstanding any other provision of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;United States&rdquo;, when used in a geographical sense, means the 50 States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits for any individual who is married and whose spouse is living with him in the same household but is not an eligible spouse, such individual's income and resources shall be deemed to include any income and resources of such spouse, whether or not available to such individual, except to the extent determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be inequitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits for any individual who is a child under age 18, such individual's income and resources shall be deemed to include any income and resources of a parent of such individual (or the spouse of such a parent) who is living in the same household as such individual, whether or not available to such individual, except to the extent determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be inequitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of any child who has not attained the age of 18 years who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is disabled;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) received benefits under this subchapter, pursuant to section 1382(e)(1)(B) of this title, while in an institution described in section 1382(e)(1)(B) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is eligible for medical assistance under a State home care plan approved by the Secretary under the provisions of section 1396n(c) of this title relating to waivers, or authorized under section 1396a(e)(3) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) but for this subparagraph, would not be eligible for benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits for any individual <!-- PDFPage:1576 -->who is an alien, such individual's income and resources shall be deemed to include the income and resources of his sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such alien has a sponsor) as provided in section 1382j of this title. Any such income deemed to be income of such individual shall be treated as unearned income of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), a spouse or parent (or spouse of such a parent) who is absent from the household in which the individual lives due solely to a duty assignment as a member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be deemed to be living in the same household as the individual.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Levels of supplementary payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commissioner of Social Security shall not find that a State has failed to meet the requirements imposed by paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of this section with respect to the levels of its supplementary payments for a particular month or months if the State's expenditures for such payments in the twelve-month period (within which such month or months fall) beginning on the effective date of any increase in the level of supplemental security income benefits pursuant to section 1382f of this title are not less than its expenditures for such payments in the preceding twelve-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of determining under paragraph (1) whether a State's expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of any increase in the level of supplemental security income benefits are not less than the State's expenditures for such payments in the preceding 12-month pe<!-- PDFPage:1587 -->riod, the Commissioner of Social Security, in computing the State's expenditures, shall disregard, pursuant to a 1-time election of the State, all expenditures by the State for retroactive supplementary payments that are required to be made in connection with the retroactive supplemental security income benefits referred to in section 5041 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Election to apply subsection (a)(4)</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the amount of any increase in the combined level involved under paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, any portion of such amount which would otherwise be attributable to the increase under section 1382f(c) of this title shall be deemed instead to be equal to the amount of the cost-of-living adjustment which would have occurred in July 1983 (without regard to the 3-percent limitation contained in section 415(i)(1)(B) of this title) if section 111 of the Social Security Amendments of 1983 had not been enacted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Passthrough relating to optional State supplementation</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization of appropriations for pilot program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to establish and carry <!-- PDFPage:1591 -->out a 3-year Federal-State pilot program to provide medical and social services for certain handicapped individuals in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The total sum of $18,000,000 shall be allotted to the States for such program by the Commissioner of Social Security, during the period beginning September 1, 1981, and ending September 30, 1984, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The total sum of $6,000,000 shall be allotted to the States for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982 (which for purposes of this section shall include the month of September 1981).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The total sum of $6,000,000, plus any amount remaining available (after the application of paragraph (4)) from the allotment made under subparagraph (A), shall be allotted to the States for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The total sum of $6,000,000, plus any amount remaining available (after the application of paragraph (4)) from the allotments made under subparagraphs (A) and (B), shall be allotted to the States for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1984.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The allotment to each State from the total sum allotted under paragraph (1) for any fiscal year shall bear the same ratio to such total sum as the number of individuals in such State who are over age 17 and under age 65 and are receiving supplemental security income benefits as disabled individuals in such year (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security on the basis of the most recent data available) bears to the total number of such individuals in all the States. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;supplemental security income benefits&rdquo; includes payments made pursuant to an agreement under section 1382e(a) of this title or under section 212(b) of Public Law 93&ndash;66.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the beginning of each fiscal year in which the pilot program under this section is in effect, each State that does not intend to use the allotment to which it is entitled for such year (or any allotment which was made to it for a prior fiscal year), or that does not intend to use the full amount of any such allotment, shall certify to the Commissioner of Social Security the amount of such allotment which it does not intend to use, and the State's allotment for the fiscal year (or years) involved shall thereupon be reduced by the amount so certified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The portion of the total amount available for allotment for any particular fiscal year under paragraph (1) which is not allotted to States for that year by reason of paragraph (3) (plus the amount of any reductions made at the beginning of such year in the allotments of States for prior fiscal years under paragraph (3)) shall be reallocated in such manner as the Commissioner of Social Security may determine to be appropriate to States which need, and will use, additional assistance in providing services to severely handicapped individuals in that particular year under their approved plans. Any amount reallocated to a State under this paragraph for use in a particular fiscal year shall be treated for purposes of this section as increasing such State's allotment for that year by an equivalent amount.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requisite features of State plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to participate in the pilot program and be eligible to receive payments for any period under subsection (d) of this section, a State (during such period) must have a plan, approved by the Commissioner of Social Security as meeting the requirements of this section, which provides medical and social services for severely handicapped individuals whose earnings are above the level which ordinarily demonstrates an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity and who are not receiving benefits under section 1382 or 1382h of this title or assistance under a State plan approved under section 1396a of this title, and which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) declares the intent of the State to participate in the pilot program;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) describes the criteria to be applied by the State in determining the eligibility of any individual for assistance under the plan and in any event requires a determination by the State agency to the effect that (A) such individual's ability to continue his employment would be significantly inhibited without such assistance and (B) such individual's earnings are not sufficient to allow him to provide for himself a reasonable equivalent of the cash and other benefits that would be available to him under this subchapter and subchapters XIX and XX of this chapter in the absence of those earnings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) describes the process by which the eligibility of individuals for such assistance is to be determined (and such process may not involve the performance of functions by any State agency or entity which is engaged in making determinations of disability for purposes of disability insurance or supplemental security income benefits except when the use of a different agency or entity to perform those functions would not be feasible);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) describes the medical and social services to be provided under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) describes the manner in which the medical and social services involved are to be provided and, if they are not to be provided through the State's medical assistance and social services programs under subchapters XIX and XX of this chapter (with the Federal payments being made under subsection (d) of this section rather than under those subchapters), specifies the particular mechanisms and procedures to be used in providing such services; and</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Attribution as unearned income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits under this subchapter for an individual who is an alien, the income and resources of any person who (as a sponsor of such individual's entry into the United States) executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement with respect to such individual, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse, shall be deemed to be the income and resources of such individual (in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this section) for a period of 3 years after the individual's entry into the United States. Any such income deemed to be income of such individual shall be treated as unearned income of such individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of amount and resources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of income of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the unearned income of an alien for any year shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The total yearly rate of earned and unearned income (as determined under section 1382a(a) of this title) of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by an amount equal to (i) the maximum amount of the Federal benefit under this subchapter for such year which would be payable to an eligible individual who has no other income and who does not have an eligible spouse (as determined under section 1382(b)(1) of this title), plus (ii) one-half of the amount determined under clause (i) multiplied by the number of individuals who are dependents of such sponsor (or such sponsor's spouse if such spouse is living with the sponsor), other than such alien and such alien's spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The amount of income which shall be deemed to be unearned income of such alien shall be at a yearly rate equal to the amount determined under subparagraph (B). The period for determination of such amount shall be the same as the period for determination of benefits under section 1382(c) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of resources of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the resources of an alien for any year shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The total amount of the resources (as determined under section 1382b of this title) of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by an amount equal to (i) the applicable amount determined under section 1382(a)(3)(B) of this title in the case of a sponsor who has no spouse with whom he is <!-- PDFPage:1593 -->living, or (ii) the applicable amount determined under section 1382(a)(3)(A) of this title in the case of a sponsor who has a spouse with whom he is living.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The resources of such sponsor (and spouse) as determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be deemed to be resources of such alien in addition to any resources of such alien.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Support and maintenance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the amount of income of an alien during the period of 3 years after such alien's entry into the United States, the reduction in dollar amounts otherwise required under section 1382a(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title shall not be applicable if such alien is living in the household of a person who is a sponsor (or such sponsor's spouse) of such alien, and is receiving support and maintenance in kind from such sponsor (or spouse), nor shall support or maintenance furnished in cash or kind to an alien by such alien's sponsor (to the extent that it reflects income or resources which were taken into account in determining the amount of income and resources to be deemed to the alien under subsection (a) or (b) of this section) be considered to be income of such alien under section 1382a(a)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Information and documentation; agreements with Secretary of State and Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any individual who is an alien shall, during the period of 3 years after entry into the United States, in order to be an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter, be required to provide to the Commissioner of Social Security such information and documentation with respect to his sponsor as may be necessary in order for the Commissioner of Social Security to make any determination required under this section, and to obtain any cooperation from such sponsor necessary for any such determination. Such alien shall also be required to provide to the Commissioner of Social Security such information and documentation as the Commissioner of Social Security may request and which such alien or his sponsor provided in support of such alien's immigration application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commissioner of Social Security shall enter into agreements with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General whereby any information available to such persons and required in order to make any determination under this section will be provided by such persons to the Commissioner of Social Security, and whereby such persons shall inform any sponsor of an alien, at the time such sponsor executes an affidavit of support or similar agreement, of the requirements imposed by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Joint and several liability of alien and sponsor for overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any sponsor of an alien, and such alien, shall be jointly and severally liable for an amount equal to any overpayment made to such alien during the period of 3 years after such alien's entry into the United States, on account of such sponsor's failure to provide correct information under the provisions of this section, except where such sponsor was without fault, or where good cause for such failure existed. Any such overpayment which is not repaid to the Commissioner of Social Security or recovered in accordance with section 1383(b) of this title shall be withheld from any subsequent payment to which such alien or such sponsor is entitled under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this section shall not apply with respect to any individual who is an &ldquo;aged, blind, or disabled individual&rdquo; for purposes of this subchapter by reason of blindness (as determined under section 1382c(a)(2) of this title) or disability (as determined under section 1382c(a)(3) of this title), from and after the onset of the impairment, if such blindness or disability commenced after the date of such individual's admission into the United States for permanent residence.</p>
