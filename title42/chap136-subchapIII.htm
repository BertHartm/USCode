<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Study and development of model legislation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) study and evaluate the manner in which the States have taken measures to protect the confidentiality of communications between sexual assault or domestic violence victims and their therapists or trained counselors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop model legislation that will provide the maximum protection possible for the confidentiality of such communications, within any applicable constitutional limits, taking into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the danger that counseling programs for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence will be unable to achieve their goal of helping victims recover from the trauma associated with these crimes if there is no assurance that the records of the counseling sessions will be kept confidential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consideration of the appropriateness of an absolute privilege for communications between victims of sexual assault or domestic violence and their therapists or trained counselors, in light of the likelihood that such an absolute privilege will provide the maximum guarantee of confidentiality but also in light of the possibility that such an absolute privilege may be held to violate the rights of criminal defendants under the Federal or State constitutions by denying them the opportunity to obtain exculpatory evidence and present it at trial; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consideration of what limitations on the disclosure of confidential communications between victims of these crimes and their counselors, short of an absolute privilege, are most likely to ensure that the counseling programs will not be undermined, and specifically whether no such disclosure should be allowed unless, at a minimum, there has been a particularized showing by a criminal defendant of a compelling need for records of such communications, and adequate procedural safeguards are in place to prevent unnecessary or damaging disclosures; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) prepare and disseminate to State authorities the findings made and model legislation developed as a result of the study and evaluation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report and recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than the date that is 1 year after September 13, 1994, the Attorney General shall report to the Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the findings of the study and the model legislation required by this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) recommendations based on the findings on the need for and appropriateness of further action by the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of Federal evidentiary rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Judicial Conference of the United States shall evaluate and report to Congress its views on whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended, and if so, how they should be amended, to guarantee that the confidentiality of communications between sexual assault victims and their therapists or trained counselors will be adequately protected in Federal court proceedings.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cause of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;crime of violence motivated by gender&rdquo; means a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's gender; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;crime of violence&rdquo; means&mdash;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13981_1_target" name="13981_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony against the person or that would constitute a felony against property if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, and that would come within the meaning of State or Federal offenses described in section 16 of title 18, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not those acts were committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prison jurisdiction of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but for the relationship between the person who takes such action and the individual against whom such action is taken.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation and procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section entitles a person to a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be motivated by gender (within the meaning of subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No prior criminal action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Concurrent jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal and State courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Supplemental jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither section 1367 of title 28 nor subsection (c) of this section shall be construed, by reason of a claim arising under such subsection, to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody decree.</p>
