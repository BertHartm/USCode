<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 180 days after December 20, 2000, the Secretary shall by regulation establish standards for operating the sanctuary system to provide for the permanent retirement of surplus chimpanzees. In establishing the standards, the Secretary shall consider the recommendations of the board of directors of the nonprofit private entity that receives the contract under subsection (e) of this section, and shall consider the recommendations of the National Research Council applicable to surplus chimpanzees that are made in the report published in 1997 and entitled &ldquo;Chimpanzees in Research&mdash;Strategies for Their Ethical Care, Management, and Use&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Chimpanzees accepted into system</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) A prohibition that the chimpanzees may not be discharged from the system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) A provision that the Secretary may, in the discretion of the Secretary, accept into the system chimpanzees that are not surplus chimpanzees.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Such a fee may not be imposed for accepting the chimpanzee if the chimpanzee is owned by an entity that operates a primate center, and if the chimpanzee is housed in the primate center pursuant to the program for regional centers for research on primates that is carried out by the Director of NIH, acting through the Office of the Director of NIH,.<sup><a href="#283m_1_target" name="283m_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Any fees collected under this subparagraph are available to the Secretary for the costs of operating the system. Any other fees received by the Secretary for the long-term care of chimpanzees (including any Federal fees that are collected for such purpose and are identified in the report under section 3 of the Chimpanzee Health Improvement, Maintenance, and Protection Act) are available for operating the system, in addition to availability for such other purposes as may be authorized for the use of the fees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A provision that the Secretary may deny such chimpanzee acceptance into the system if the capacity of the system is not sufficient to accept the chimpanzee, taking into account the physical capacity of the system; the financial resources of the system; the number of individuals serving as the staff of the system, including the number of professional staff; the necessity of providing for the safety of the staff and of the public; the necessity of caring for accepted chimpanzees in accordance with the standards under paragraph (1); and such other factors as may be appropriate.</p>
