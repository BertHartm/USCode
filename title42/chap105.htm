<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; prerequisites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to designate as a Head Start agency any local public or private nonprofit or for-profit agency, within a community, which (1) has the power and authority to carry out the purposes of this subchapter and perform the functions set forth in section 9837 of this title within a community; and (2) is determined by the Secretary (in consultation with the chief executive officer of the State involved, if such State expends non-Federal funds to carry out Head Start programs) to be capable of planning, conducting, administering, and evaluating, either directly or by other arrangements, a Head Start program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, a community may be a city, county, or multicity or multicounty unit within a State, an Indian reservation (including Indians in any off-reservation area designated by an appropriate tribal government in consultation with the Secretary), or a neighborhood or other area (irrespective of boundaries or political subdivisions) which provides a suitable organizational base and possesses the commonality of interest needed to operate a Head Start program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the administration of the provisions of this section (subject to paragraph (2)), the Secretary shall, in consultation with the chief executive officer of the State involved if such State expends non-Federal funds to carry out Head Start programs, give priority in the designation of Head Start agencies to any local public or private nonprofit or for-profit agency which is receiving funds under any Head Start program on August 13, 1981, unless the Secretary determines that the agency involved fails to meet program and financial management requirements, performance standards described in section 9836a(a)(1) of this title, results-based performance measures developed by the Secretary under section 9836a(b) of this title, or other requirements established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If there is no agency of the type referred to in paragraph (1) because of any change in the assistance furnished to programs for economically disadvantaged persons, the Secretary shall, in consultation with the chief executive officer of the State if such State expends non-Federal funds to carry out Head Start programs, give priority in the designation of Head Start agencies to any successor agency that is operating a Head Start program in substantially the same manner as the predecessor agency that did receive funds in the fiscal year preceding the fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the Secretary shall not give such priority to any agency with respect to which financial assistance has been terminated, or an application for refunding has been denied, under this subchapter by the Secretary after affording such agency reasonable notice and op<!-- PDFPage:5935 -->portunity for a full and fair hearing in accordance with section 9841(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Designation; Head Start agency; qualified applicants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If no entity in a community is entitled to the priority specified in subsection (c) of this section, then the Secretary may designate a Head Start agency from among qualified applicants in such community.

In selecting from among qualified applicants for designation as a Head Start agency, the Secretary shall consider the effectiveness of each such applicant to provide Head Start services, based on&mdash;</p>

In selecting from among qualified applicants for designation as a Head Start agency under subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall give priority to applicants that have demonstrated capacity in providing comprehensive early childhood services to children and their families.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) administrative and financial management standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) standards relating to the condition and location of facilities for such agencies, programs, and projects; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such other standards as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations in developing standards</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consult with experts in the fields of child development, early childhood education, child health care, family services (including linguistically and culturally appropriate services to non-English language background children and their families), administration, and financial management, and with persons with experience in the operation of Head Start programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into consideration&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) the need for, and state-of-the-art developments relating to, local policies and activities designed to ensure that children participating in Head Start programs make a successful transition to public schools; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) review and revise as necessary the performance standards in effect under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) ensure that any such revisions in the performance standards will not result in the elimination of or any reduction in the scope or types of health, education, parental involvement, nutritional, social, or other services required to be provided under such standards as in effect on October 27, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Standards relating to obligations to delegate agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In developing standards under this subsection, the Secretary shall describe the obligations of a Head Start agency to a delegate agency to which the Head Start agency has delegated responsibility for providing services under this subchapter and determine whether the Head Start agency complies with the standards. The Secretary shall consider such compliance during the review described in subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section and in determining whether to renew financial assistance to the Head Start agency under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Results-based performance measures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, in consultation with representatives of Head Start agencies and with experts in the fields of early childhood education and development, family services, and program management, shall develop methods and procedures for measuring, annually and over longer periods, the quality and effectiveness of programs operated by Head Start agencies, and the impact of the services provided through the programs to children and their families (referred to in this subchapter as &ldquo;results-based performance measures&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Characteristics of measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The performance measures developed under this subsection shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be adaptable for use in self-assessment, peer review, and program evaluation of individual Head Start agencies and programs, not later than July 1, 1999; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) be developed for other program purposes as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The performance measures shall include the performance standards described in subsection (a)(1)(B)(ii) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall use the performance measures developed pursuant to this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to identify strengths and weaknesses in the operation of Head Start programs nationally, regionally, and locally; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to identify problem areas that may require additional training and technical assistance resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Educational performance measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such results-based performance measures shall include educational performance measures that ensure that children participating in Head Start programs&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Monitoring of local agencies and programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to determine whether Head Start agencies meet standards established under this subchapter and results-based performance measures developed by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section with respect to program, administrative, financial management, and other requirements, the Secretary shall conduct the following reviews of designated Head Start agencies, and of the Head Start programs operated by such agencies:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A full review of each such agency at least once during each 3-year period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Followup reviews including prompt return visits to agencies and programs that fail to meet the standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Other reviews as appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) are conducted by review teams that shall include individuals who are knowledgeable about Head Start programs and, to the maximum extent practicable, the diverse (including linguistic and cultural) needs of eligible children (including children with disabilities) and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) include as part of the reviews of the programs, a review and assessment of program effectiveness, as measured in accordance with the results-based performance measures developed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and with the performance standards established pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) seek information from the communities and the States involved about the performance of the programs and the efforts of the Head Start agencies to collaborate with other entities carrying out early childhood education and child care programs in the community.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Corrective action; termination</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;9839. Administrative requirements and standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Employment practices, nonpartisanship, staff accountability, public access to information, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Head Start agency shall observe standards of organization, management, and administration which will assure, so far as reasonably possible, that all program activities are conducted in a manner consistent with the purposes of this subchapter and the objective of providing assistance effectively, efficiently, and free of any taint of partisan political bias or personal or family favoritism. Each such agency shall establish or adopt rules to carry out this section, which shall include rules to assure full staff accountability in matters governed by law, regulations, or agency policy. Each agency shall also provide for reasonable public access to information, including public hearings at the request of appropriate community groups and reasonable public access to books and records of the agency or other agencies engaged in program activities or operations involving the use of authority or funds for which it is responsible. Each such agency shall adopt for itself and other agencies using funds or exercising authority for which it is responsible, rules designed to (1) establish specific standards governing salaries, salary increases, travel and per diem allowances, and other employee benefits; (2) assure that only persons capable of discharging their duties with competence and integrity are employed and that employees are promoted or advanced under impartial procedures calculated to improve agency performance and effectiveness; (3) guard against personal or financial conflicts of interest; and (4) define employee duties in an appropriate manner which will in any case preclude employees from participating, in connection with the performance of their duties, in any form of picketing, protest, or other direct action which is in violation of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Development and administrative costs of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (f) of this section, no financial assistance shall be extended under this subchapter in any case in which the Secretary determines that the costs of developing and administering a program assisted under this subchapter exceed 15 percent of the total costs, including the required non-Federal contributions to such costs, of such program. The Secretary shall establish by regulation, criteria for determining (1) the costs of developing and administering such program; and (2) the total costs of such program. In any case in which the Secretary determines that the cost of administering such program does not exceed 15 percent of such total costs but is, in the judgment of the Secretary, excessive, the Secretary shall forthwith require the recipient of such financial assistance to take such steps prescribed by the Secretary as will eliminate such excessive administrative cost, including the sharing by one or more Head Start agencies of a common director and other administrative personnel. The Secretary may waive the limitation prescribed by this subsection for specific periods of time not to exceed 12 months whenever the Secretary determines that such a waiver is necessary in order to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules and regulations; special or simplified requirements for small agencies; common or joint use of facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe rules or regulations to supplement subsections (a) and (f) of this section, which shall be binding on all agencies carrying on Head Start program activities with financial assistance under this subchapter. The Secretary may, where appropriate, establish special or simplified requirements for smaller agencies or agencies operating in rural areas. Policies and procedures shall be established to ensure that indirect costs attributable to the common or joint use of facilities and services by programs assisted under this subchapter and other programs shall be fairly allocated among the various programs which utilize such facilities and services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Publication and notification of proposed rules, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At least 30 days prior to their effective date, all rules, regulations, and application forms shall be published in the Federal Register and shall be sent to each grantee with the notification that each such grantee has the right to submit comments pertaining thereto to the Secretary prior to the final adoption thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Neutrality concerning union organizing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds appropriated to carry out this subchapter shall not be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Purchase of facility; approval requirements; financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish uniform procedures for Head Start agencies to request approval to purchase facilities, or to request approval of the purchase (after December 31, 1986) of facilities, to be used to carry out Head Start programs. The Secretary shall suspend any proceedings pending against any Head Start agency to claim costs incurred in purchasing such facilities until the agency has been afforded an opportunity to apply for approval of the purchase and the Secretary has determined whether the purchase will be approved. The Secretary shall not be required to repay claims previously satisfied by Head Start agencies for costs incurred in the purchase of such facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Financial assistance provided under this subchapter may not be used by a Head Start agency to purchase a facility (including paying the cost of amortizing the principal, and paying interest on, loans) to be used to carry out a Head Start program unless the Secretary approves a request that is submitted by such agency and contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description of the site of the facility proposed to be purchased or that was previously purchased;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the plans and specifications of such facility;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5945 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) information demonstrating that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the proposed purchase will result, or the previous purchase has resulted, in savings when compared to the costs that would be incurred to acquire the use of an alternative facility to carry out such program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the lack of alternative facilities will prevent, or would have prevented, the operation of such program;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) in the case of a request regarding a previously purchased facility, information demonstrating that the facility will be used principally as a Head Start center, or a direct support facility for a Head Start program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) such other information and assurances as the Secretary may require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon a determination by the Secretary that suitable facilities are not otherwise available to Indian tribes to carry out Head Start programs, and that the lack of suitable facilities will inhibit the operation of such programs, the Secretary, in the discretion of the Secretary, may authorize the use of financial assistance, from the amount reserved under section 9835(a)(2)(A) of this title, to make payments for the purchase of facilities owned by such tribes. The amount of such a payment for such a facility shall not exceed the fair market value of the facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payments for capital expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon a determination by the Secretary that suitable facilities (including public school facilities) are not otherwise available to Indian tribes, rural communities, and other low-income communities to carry out Head Start programs, that the lack of suitable facilities will inhibit the operation of such programs, and that construction of such facilities is more cost effective than purchase of available facilities or renovation, the Secretary, in the discretion of the Secretary, may authorize the use of financial assistance under this subchapter to make payments for capital expenditures related to facilities that will be used to carry out such programs. The Secretary shall establish uniform procedures for Head Start agencies to request approval for such payments, and shall promote, to the extent practicable, the collocation of Head Start programs with other programs serving low-income children and families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such payments may be used for capital expenditures (including paying the cost of amortizing the principal, and paying interest on, loans) such as expenditures for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) construction of facilities that are not in existence on the date of the determination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) major renovation of facilities in existence on such date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) purchase of vehicles used for programs conducted at the Head Start facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) All laborers and mechanics employed by contractors or subcontractors in the construction or renovation of facilities to be used to carry out Head Start programs shall be paid wages at not less than those prevailing on similar construction in the locality, as determined by the Secretary of Labor in accordance with sections 3141&ndash;3144, 3146, and 3147 of title 40.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Personnel preferences to Indian tribe members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In all personnel actions of the American Indian Programs Branch of the Head Start Bureau of the Administration for Children and Families, the Secretary shall give the same preference to individuals who are members of an Indian tribe as the Secretary gives to a disabled veteran, as defined in section 2108(3)(C) of title 5. The Secretary shall take such additional actions as may be necessary to promote recruitment of such individuals for employment in the Administration.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;9840. Participation in Head Start programs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria for eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall by regulation prescribe eligibility for the participation of persons in Head Start programs assisted under this subchapter. Except as provided in paragraph (2), such criteria may provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that children from low-income families shall be eligible for participation in programs assisted under this subchapter if their families&rsquo; incomes are below the poverty line, or if their families are eligible or, in the absence of child care, would potentially be eligible for public assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) pursuant to such regulations as the Secretary shall prescribe, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) programs assisted under this subchapter may include, to a reasonable extent, participation of children in the area served who would benefit from such programs but whose families do not meet the low-income criteria prescribed pursuant to subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a child who has been determined to meet the low-income criteria and who is participating in a Head Start program in a program year shall be considered to continue to meet the low-income criteria through the end of the succeeding program year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining, for purposes of this paragraph, whether a child who has applied for enrollment in a Head Start program meets the low-income criteria, an entity may consider evidence of family income during the 12 months preceding the month in which the application is submitted, or during the calendar year preceding the calendar year in which the application is submitted, whichever more accurately reflects the needs of the family at the time of application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a Head Start program is operated in a community with a population of 1,000 or less individuals and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) there is no other preschool program in the community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the community is located in a medically underserved area, as designated by the Secretary pursuant to section 254c(b)(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#9840_1_target" name="9840_1">1</a></sup> of this title and is located in a health professional shortage area, as designated by the Secretary pursuant to section 254e(a)(1) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the community is in a location which, by reason of remoteness, does not permit reasonable access to the types of services described in clauses (A) and (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) not less than 50 percent of the families to be served in the community are eligible under the eligibility criteria established by the Secretary under paragraph (1);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Head Start program in each such locality shall establish the criteria for eligibility, except that no child residing in such community whose family is eligible under such eligibility criteria shall, by virtue of such project's eligibility criteria, be denied an opportunity to participate in such program. During the period beginning on October 30, 1984, and ending on October 1, 1994, and unless specifically authorized in any statute of the United States enacted after October 30, 1984, the Secretary may not make any change in the method, as in effect on April 25, 1984, of calculating income used to prescribe eligibility for the participation of persons in the Head Start programs assisted under this subchapter if such change would result in any reduction in, or exclusion from, participation of persons in any of such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of fee schedule or charging of fees; payment by families willing and able to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not prescribe any fee schedule or otherwise provide for the charging of any fees for participation in Head Start programs, unless such fees are authorized by legislation hereafter enacted. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prevent the families of children who participate in Head Start programs and who are willing and able to pay the full cost of such participation from doing so. A Head Start agency that provides a Head Start program with full-working-day services in collaboration with other agencies or entities may collect a family copayment to support extended day services if a copayment is required in conjunction with the collaborative. The copayment charged to families receiving services through the Head Start program shall not exceed the copayment charged to families with similar incomes and circumstances who are receiving the services through participation in a program carried out by another agency or entity.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5947 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Availability of more than one year of services; children eligible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Head Start program operated in a community shall be permitted to provide more than 1 year of Head Start services to eligible children (age 3 to compulsory school attendance) in the State. Each Head Start program operated in a community shall be permitted to recruit and accept applications for enrollment of children throughout the year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An Indian tribe that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) operates a Head Start program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) enrolls as participants in the program all children in the community served by the tribe (including a community that is an off-reservation area, designated by an appropriate tribal government, in consultation with the Secretary) from families that meet the low-income criteria prescribed under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) has the resources to enroll additional children in the community who do not meet the low-income criteria;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">may enroll such additional children in a Head Start program, in accordance with this subsection, if the program predominantly serves children who meet the low-income criteria.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Indian tribe shall enroll the children in the Head Start program in accordance with such requirements as the Secretary may specify by regulation promulgated after consultation with Indian tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In providing services through a Head Start program to such children, the Indian tribe may not use funds that the Secretary has determined, in accordance with section 9835(g)(3) of this title, are to be used for expanding Head Start programs under this subchapter.</p>
