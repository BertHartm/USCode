<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Publication and notification of proposed rules, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At least 30 days prior to their effective date, all rules, regulations, and application forms shall be published in the Federal Register and shall be sent to each grantee with the notification that each such grantee has the right to submit comments pertaining thereto to the Secretary prior to the final adoption thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Neutrality concerning union organizing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds appropriated to carry out this subchapter shall not be used to assist, promote, or deter union organizing.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish uniform procedures for Head Start agencies to request approval to purchase facilities, or to request approval of the purchase (after December 31, 1986) of facilities, to be used to carry out Head Start programs. The Secretary shall suspend any proceedings pending against any Head Start agency to claim costs incurred in purchasing such facilities until the agency has been afforded an opportunity to apply for approval of the purchase and the Secretary has determined whether the purchase will be approved. The Secretary shall not be required to repay claims previously satisfied by Head Start agencies for costs incurred in the purchase of such facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Financial assistance provided under this subchapter may not be used by a Head Start agency to purchase a facility (including paying the cost of amortizing the principal, and paying interest on, loans) to be used to carry out a Head Start program unless the Secretary approves a request that is submitted by such agency and contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a description of the efforts by the agency to coordinate or collaborate with other providers in the community to seek assistance, including financial assistance, prior to the use of funds under this section;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) in the case of a request regarding a previously purchased facility, information demonstrating that the facility will be used principally as a Head Start center, or a direct support facility for a Head Start program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) such other information and assurances as the Secretary may require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon a determination by the Secretary that suitable facilities are not otherwise available to Indian tribes to carry out Head Start programs, and that the lack of suitable facilities will inhibit the operation of such programs, the Secretary, in the discretion of the Secretary, may authorize the use of financial assistance to make payments for the purchase of facilities owned by such tribes. The amount of such a payment for such a facility shall not exceed the fair market value of the facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payments for capital expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon a determination by the Secretary that suitable facilities (including public school facilities) are not otherwise available to Indian tribes, rural communities, and other low-income communities to carry out Head Start programs, that the lack of suitable facilities will inhibit the operation of such programs, and that construction of such facilities is more cost effective than purchase of available facilities or renovation, the Secretary, in the discretion of the Secretary, may authorize the use of financial assistance under this subchapter to make payments for capital expenditures related to facilities that will be used to carry out such programs. The Secretary shall establish uniform procedures for Head Start agencies to request approval for such payments, and shall promote, to the extent practicable, the collocation of Head Start programs with other programs serving low-income children and families.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) major renovation of facilities in existence on such date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) purchase of vehicles used for programs conducted at the Head Start facilities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In all personnel actions of the American Indian Programs Branch of the Head Start Bureau of the Administration for Children and Families, the Secretary shall give the same preference to individuals who are members of an Indian tribe as the Secretary gives to a disabled veteran, as defined in section 2108(3)(C) of title 5.

A Head Start agency that provides a Head Start program with full-working-day services in collaboration with other agencies or entities may collect a family copayment to support extended day services if a copayment is required in conjunction with the collaborative. The copayment charged to families receiving services through the Head Start program shall not exceed the copayment charged to families with similar incomes and circumstances who are receiving the services through participation in a program carried out by another agency or entity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Availability of more than one year of services; children eligible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Head Start program operated in a community shall be permitted to provide more than 1 year of Head Start services to eligible children in the State.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) has the resources to enroll additional children in the community who do not meet the low-income criteria;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
