<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cooperation of non-Federal interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After December 31, 1970, the construction of any water resources project, or an acceptable separable element thereof, by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, or by a non-Federal interest where such interest will be reimbursed for such construction under the provisions of section 1962d&ndash;5a of this title or under any other provision of law, shall not be commenced until each non-Federal interest has entered into a written agreement with the Secretary of the Army to furnish its required cooperation for the project or the appropriate element of the project, as the case may be; except that no such agreement shall be required if the Secretary determines that the administrative costs associated with negotiating, executing, or administering the agreement would exceed the amount of the contribution required from the non-Federal interest and are less than $25,000. In any such agreement entered into by a State, or a body politic of the State which derives its powers from the State constitution, or a governmental entity created by the State legislature, the agreement may reflect that it does not obligate future appropriations for such performance and payment when obligating future appropriations would be inconsistent with constitutional or statutory limitations of the State or a political subdivision of the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of non-Federal interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A non-Federal interest shall be a legally constituted public body with full authority and capability to perform the terms of its agreement and to pay damages, if necessary, in the event of failure to perform.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Enforcement; jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall be enforcible in the appropriate district court of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nonperformance of terms of agreement by non-Federal interest; notice; reasonable opportunity for performance; performance by Chief of Engineers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After commencement of construction of a project, the Chief of Engineers may undertake performance of those items of cooperation necessary to the functioning of the project for its purposes, if he has first notified the non-Federal interest of its failure to perform the terms of its agreement and has given such interest a reasonable time after such notification to so perform.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to any project the construction of which was commenced before January 1, 1972, or to the assurances for future demands required by the Water Supply Act of 1958, as amended [43 U.S.C. 390b].</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Compliance With Cooperation Requirements for Non-Federal Interests in Water Resources Projects</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 912(b) of Pub. L. 99&ndash;662 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(1) The Secretary may require compliance with any requirements pertaining to cooperation by non-Federal interests in carrying out any water resources project authorized before, on, or after the date of enactment of this Act [Nov. 17, 1986].</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Whenever on the basis of any information available to the Secretary, the Secretary finds that any non-Federal interest is not providing cooperation required under subsection (a) [amending this section], the Secretary shall issue an order requiring such non-Federal interest to provide such cooperation. After notice and opportunity for a hearing, if the Secretary finds that any person is violating an order issued under this section [amending this section], such person shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $10,000 per day of such violation, except that the total amount of civil penalties for any violation shall not exceed $50,000.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Non-Federal interests shall be liable for interest on any payments required pursuant to section 221 of the Flood Control Act of 1970 [this section] that may fall delinquent. The interest rate to be charged on any such delinquent payment shall be at a rate, to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, equal to 150 percent of the average bond equivalent rate of the thirteen-week Treasury bills auctioned immediately prior to the date on which such payment became delinquent, or auctioned immediately prior to the beginning of each additional three-month period if the period of delinquency exceeds three months.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(4) The Secretary may request the Attorney General to bring a civil action for appropriate relief, including permanent or temporary injunction, for any violation of an order issued under this section, to collect a civil penalty imposed under this section, to recover any cost incurred by the Secretary in undertaking performance of any item of cooperation under section 221(d) of the Flood Control Act of 1970 [subsec. (d) of this section], or to collect interest for which a non-Federal interest is liable under paragraph (3). Any action under this subsection may be brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the defendant is located or resides, or is doing business, and such court shall have jurisdiction to restrain such violation, to require compliance, to require payment of any civil penalty imposed under this section, and to require payment of any costs incurred by the Secretary in undertaking performance of any such item.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(5) The Secretary is authorized to determine that no funds appropriated for operation and maintenance, including operation and maintenance of the project for flood control, Mississippi River and Tributaries, are to be used for the particular benefit of projects within the jurisdiction of any non-Federal interest when such non-Federal interest is in arrears for more than twenty-four months in the payment of charges due under an agreement entered into with the United States pursuant to section 221 of the Flood Control Act of 1970 (Public Law 91&ndash;611) [this section].&rdquo;</p>
