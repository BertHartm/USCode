<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cooperation of non-Federal interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After December 31, 1970, the construction of any water resources project, or an acceptable separable element thereof, by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, or by a non-Federal interest where such interest will be reimbursed for such construction under any provision of law, shall not be commenced until each non-Federal interest has entered into a written partnership agreement with the Secretary (or, where appropriate, the district engineer for the district in which the project will be carried out) under which each party agrees to carry out its responsibilities and requirements for implementation or construction of the project or the appropriate element of the project, as the case may be; except that no such agreement shall be required if the Secretary determines that the administrative costs associated with negotiating, executing, or administering the agreement would exceed the amount of the contribution required from the non-Federal interest and are less than $25,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Liquidated damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) may include a provision for liquidated damages in the event of a failure of one or more parties to perform.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Obligation of future appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) and entered into by a State, or a body politic of the State which derives its powers from the State constitution, or a governmental entity created by the State legislature, the agreement may reflect that it does not obligate future appropriations for such performance and payment when obligating future appropriations would be inconsistent with <!-- PDFPage:3886 -->constitutional or statutory limitations of the State or a political subdivision of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Credit for in-kind contributions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) may provide with respect to a project that the Secretary shall credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of the project, including a project implemented without specific authorization in law, the value of in-kind contributions made by the non-Federal interest, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the costs of planning (including data collection), design, management, mitigation, construction, and construction services that are provided by the non-Federal interest for implementation of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value of materials or services provided before execution of the partnership agreement, including efforts on constructed elements incorporated into the project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the value of materials and services provided after execution of the partnership agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may credit an in-kind contribution under subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary determines that the material or service provided as an in-kind contribution is integral to the project.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Work performed before partnership agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which the non-Federal interest is to receive credit under subparagraph (A)(ii) for the cost of work carried out by the non-Federal interest and such work has not been carried out as of November 8, 2007, the Secretary and the non-Federal interest shall enter into an agreement under which the non-Federal interest shall carry out such work, and only work carried out following the execution of the agreement shall be eligible for credit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Credit authorized under this paragraph for a project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not exceed the non-Federal share of the cost of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall not alter any other requirement that a non-Federal interest provide lands, easements, relocations, rights-of-way, or areas for disposal of dredged material for the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not alter any requirement that a non-Federal interest pay a portion of the costs of construction of the project under sections 2211 and 2213 of title 33; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) shall not exceed the actual and reasonable costs of the materials, services, or other things provided by the non-Federal interest, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Applicability</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This paragraph shall apply to water resources projects authorized after November 16, 1986, including projects initiated after November 16, 1986, without specific authorization in law.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which a specific provision of law provides for a non-Federal interest to receive credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of a study for, or construction or operation and maintenance of, a water resources project, the specific provision of law shall apply instead of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of non-Federal interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;non-Federal interest&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">After commencement of construction of a project, the Chief of Engineers may undertake performance of those items of cooperation necessary to the functioning of the project for its purposes, if he has first notified the non-Federal interest of its failure to perform the terms of its agreement and has given such interest a reasonable time after such notification to so perform.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Delegation of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than June 30, 2008, the Secretary shall issue policies and guidelines for partnership agreements that delegate to the district engineers, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the authority to approve any policy in a partnership agreement that has appeared in an agreement previously approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority to approve any policy in a partnership agreement the specific terms of which are dictated by law or by a final feasibility study, final environmental impact statement, or other final decision document for a water resources project;</p>
