<!-- PDFPage:1258 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount collected during any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1976</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be paid to the public agency responsible for supervising the placement of the child to the extent that the amounts collected exceed the foster care maintenance payments made with respect to the child during such period but not the amounts required by a court or administrative order to be paid as support on behalf of the child during such period; and the responsible agency may use the payments in the manner it determines will serve the best interests of the child, including setting such payments aside for the child's future needs or making all or a part thereof available to the person responsible for meeting the child's day-to-day needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall be retained by the State, if any portion of the amounts collected remains after making the payments required under paragraphs (1) and (2), to the extent that such portion is necessary to reimburse the State (with appropriate reimbursement to the Federal Government to the extent of its participation in the financing) for any past foster care maintenance payments (or payments of aid to families with dependent children) which were made with respect to the child (and with respect to which past collections have not previously been retained);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and any balance shall be paid to the State agency responsible for supervising the placement of the child, for use by such agency in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
