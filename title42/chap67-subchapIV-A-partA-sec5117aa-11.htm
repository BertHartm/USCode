<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to establish such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement and accounting of Federal funds paid to the applicant under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to report to the Secretary annually on the utilization, cost, and outcome of activities conducted, and services furnished, under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that if, during the majority of the 180-day period preceding October 18, 1988, the applicant has carried out any program with respect to the care of abandoned infants and young children, the applicant will expend the grant only for the purpose of significantly expanding, in accordance with subsection (a), activities under such program above the level provided under such program during the majority of such period.</p>
