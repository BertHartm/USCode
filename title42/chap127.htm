<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) children and youth are inherently our most valuable resource and their welfare, protection, healthy development, and positive role in society are essential to the Nation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an increasing opportunity for children and youth to participate in the decisions that affect their lives is essential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the family is the primary caregiver and the source of social learning which must be supported and strengthened, but when families are unable to ensure the satisfaction of the needs of children and youth, it is society's responsibility to assist them;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) at a minimum, all children and youth need and deserve access to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the best possible physical and mental health;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the highest quality of educational opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) effective training, apprenticeships, opportunities for community service, and productive employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the widest range of civic, cultural, and recreational activities which recognize young Americans as resources and promote self-esteem and a stake in their communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) comprehensive community services which are efficient, coordinated, and readily available; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5961 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) genuine participation in decisions concerning the planning and managing of their lives; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is a great need for a comprehensive national policy with respect to young individuals, designed to engage Federal, State, and local government agencies, youth organizations, and other voluntary organizations.</p>
