<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Computation of amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From the sums appropriated therefor, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to each State which has an approved plan for aid and services to needy families with children, for each quarter, beginning with the quarter commencing October 1, 1958&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of any State other than Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, an amount equal to the sum of the following proportions of the total amounts expended during such quarter as aid to families with dependent children under the State plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) five-sixths of such expenditures, not counting so much of any expenditure with respect to any month as exceeds the product of $18 multiplied by the total number of recipients of aid to families with dependent children for such month (which total number, for purposes of this subsection, means (i) the number of individuals with respect to whom such aid in the form of money payments is paid for such month, plus (ii) the number of individuals, not counted under clause (i), with respect to whom payments described in section 606(b)(2) of this title are made in such month and included as expenditures for purposes of this paragraph or paragraph (2)); plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Federal percentage of the amount by which such expenditures exceed the maximum which may be counted under clause (A), not counting so much of any expenditure with respect to any month as exceeds (i) the product of $32 multiplied by the total number of recipients of aid to families with dependent children (other than such aid in the form of foster care) for such month, plus (ii) the product of $100 multiplied by the total number of recipients of aid to families with dependent children in the form of foster care for such month; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, an amount equal to one-half of the total of the sums expended during such quarter as aid to families with dependent children under the State plan, not counting so much of any expenditure with respect to any month as exceeds $18 multiplied by the total number of recipients of such aid for such month; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any State, 50 percent of the total amounts expended during such quarter as found necessary by the Secretary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan, except that no payment shall be made with respect to amounts expended in connection with the provision of any service described in section 1397a(a) of this title other than services furnished pursuant to section 602(g) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Repealed. Pub. L. 90&ndash;248, title II, &sect;201(e)(3), Jan. 2, 1968, 81 Stat. 880.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in the case of any State, an amount equal to 50 per centum of the total amount expended under the State plan during such quarter as emergency assistance to needy families with children.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">No payment shall be made under this subsection with respect to amounts paid to supplement or otherwise increase the amount of aid to families with dependent children found payable in accordance with section 602(a)(13) of this title if such amount is determined to have been paid by the State in recognition of the current or anticipated needs of a family (other than with respect to the first or first and second months of eligibility), but any such amount, if determined to have been paid by the State in recognition of the difference between the current or anticipated needs of a family for a month based upon actual income or other relevant circumstances for such month, and the needs of such family for such month based upon income and other relevant circumstances as retrospectively determined under section 602(a)(13)(A)(ii) of this title, shall not be considered income within the meaning of section 602(a)(13) of this title for the purpose of determining the amount of aid in the succeeding months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of computation and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method of computing and paying such amounts shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall, prior to the beginning of each quarter, estimate the amount to be paid to the State for such quarter under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, such estimate to be based on (A) a report filed by the State containing its estimate of the total sum to be expended in such quarter in accordance with the provisions of such subsection and stating the amount appropriated or made available by the State and its political subdivisions for such expenditures in such quarter, and if such amount is less than the State's proportionate share of the total sum of such estimated expenditures, the source or sources from which the difference is expected to be derived, (B) records showing the number of dependent children in the State, and (C) such other investigation as the Secretary may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall then certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the amount so estimated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, (A) reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum by which he finds that his estimate for any prior quarter was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such quarter, (B) reduced by a <!-- PDFPage:1198 -->sum equivalent to the pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, of the net amount recovered during any prior quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to aid to families with dependent children furnished under the State plan, and (C) reduced by such amount as is necessary to provide the &ldquo;appropriate reimbursement of the Federal Government&rdquo; that the State is required to make under section 657 of this title out of that portion of child support collections retained by it pursuant to such section; except that such increases or reductions shall not be made to the extent that such sums have been applied to make the amount certified for any prior quarter greater or less than the amount estimated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for such prior quarter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall thereupon, through the Fiscal Service of the Department of the Treasury and prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office, pay to the State, at the time or times fixed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the amount so certified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c), (d) Repealed. Pub. L. 100&ndash;485, title II, &sect;202(b)(5), (6), Oct. 13, 1988, 102 Stat. 2377</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Uniform reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in obtaining the information needed to carry out subsection (b)(1) of this section and otherwise to perform his duties under this part, the Secretary shall establish uniform reporting requirements under which each State will be required periodically to furnish such information and data as the Secretary may determine to be necessary to ensure that sections 602(a)(37), 602(a)(43), and 602(g)(1)(A) of this title, are being effectively implemented, including at a minimum the average monthly number of families assisted under each such section, the types of such families, the amounts expended with respect to such families, and the length of time for which such families are assisted. The information and data so furnished with respect to families assisted under section 602(g) of this title shall be separately stated with respect to families who have earnings and those who do not, and with respect to families who are receiving aid under the State plan and those who are not.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reduction in amount; family planning services; aid to families with dependent children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the amount payable to any State under this part for quarters in a fiscal year shall with respect to quarters in fiscal years beginning after June 30, 1973, be reduced by 1 per centum (calculated without regard to any reduction under subsection (g) of this section) of such amount if such State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the immediately preceding fiscal year failed to carry out the provisions of section 602(a)(15)(B) of this title as pertain to requiring the offering and arrangement for provision of family planning services; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the immediately preceding fiscal year (but, in the case of the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1972, only considering the third and fourth quarters thereof), failed to carry out the provisions of section 602(a)(15)(B) of this title with respect to any individual who, within such period or periods as the Secretary may prescribe, has been an applicant for or recipient of aid to families with dependent children under the plan of the State approved under this part.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Reduction in amount; suspension; continuation; determination of substantial compliance by State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a State's program operated under part D of this subchapter is found as a result of a review conducted under section 652(a)(4) of this title not to have complied substantially with the requirements of such part for any quarter beginning after September 30, 1983, and the Secretary determines that the State's program is not complying substantially with such requirements at the time such finding is made, the amounts otherwise payable to the State under this part for such quarter and each subsequent quarter, prior to the first quarter throughout which the State program is found to be in substantial compliance with such requirements, shall be reduced (subject to paragraph (2)) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not less than one nor more than two percent, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not less than two nor more than three percent, if the finding is the second consecutive such finding made as a result of such a review, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not less than three nor more than five percent, if the finding is the third or a subsequent consecutive such finding made as a result of such a review.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The reductions required under paragraph (1) shall be suspended for any quarter if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the State submits a corrective action plan, within a period prescribed by the Secretary following notice of the finding under paragraph (1), which contains steps necessary to achieve substantial compliance within a time period which the Secretary finds to be appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the Secretary approves such corrective action plan (and any amendments thereto) as being sufficient to achieve substantial compliance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the Secretary finds that the corrective action plan (and any amendment thereto approved by the Secretary under clause (ii)), is being fully implemented by the State and that the State is progressing in accordance with the timetable contained in the plan to achieve substantial compliance with such requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A suspension of the penalty under subparagraph (A) shall continue until such time as the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the State has achieved substantial compliance,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the State is no longer implementing its corrective action plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the State is implementing or has implemented its corrective action plan but has <!-- PDFPage:1199 -->failed to achieve substantial compliance within the appropriate time period (as specified in subparagraph (A)(i)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In the case of a State whose penalty suspension ends pursuant to subparagraph (B)(i), the penalty shall not be applied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of a State whose penalty suspension ends pursuant to subparagraph (B)(ii), the penalty shall be applied as if the suspension had not occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In the case of a State whose penalty suspension ends pursuant to subparagraph (B)(iii), the penalty shall be applied to all quarters ending after the expiration of the time period specified in such subparagraph (and prior to the first quarter throughout which the State program is found to be in substantial compliance).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, section 602(a)(27) of this title, and section 652(a)(4) of this title, a State which is not in full compliance with the requirements of this part shall be determined to be in substantial compliance with such requirements only if the Secretary determines that any noncompliance with such requirements is of a technical nature which does not adversely affect the performance of the child support enforcement program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i), (j) Repealed. Pub. L. 101&ndash;239, title VIII, &sect;8004(b), Dec. 19, 1989, 103 Stat. 2460</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount specified in this paragraph is&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) This paragraph may be waived by the Secretary with respect to any State which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the characteristics of the caseload in that State make it infeasible to meet the requirements of this paragraph, and that the State is targeting other long-term or potential long-term recipients.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the average monthly number of individuals required or allowed by the State to participate in the program under part F of this subchapter who have participated in such program in months in the computation period, plus the number of individuals required or allowed by the State to participate in such program who have so participated in that month in such period for which the number of such participants is the greatest, divided by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) twice the average monthly number of individuals required to participate in such period (other than individuals described in subparagraph (C)(iii)(I) or (D) of section 602(a)(19) of this title with respect to whom the State has exercised its option to require their participation).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this subparagraph, an individual shall not be considered to have satisfactorily participated in the program under part F of this subchapter solely by reason of such individual being registered to participate in such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of this paragraph, no State shall be subject to payment under this paragraph (in lieu of paragraph (1)(A)) for failing to meet any participation rate required under this paragraph with respect to any fiscal year before 1991.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, an individual shall be determined to have participated in the program under part F of this subchapter, if such individual has participated in accordance with such requirements, consistent with regulations of the Secretary, as the State shall establish.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) If the Secretary determines that the State has failed to achieve the participation rate for any fiscal year specified in the numbered clauses of subparagraph (A), he may waive, in whole or in part, the reduction in the payment rate otherwise required by such subparagraph if he finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the State has made a good faith effort to achieve the applicable participation rate for such fiscal year; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A)(i) Subject to subparagraph (B), in the case of any family eligible for aid to families <!-- PDFPage:1201 -->with dependent children by reason of the unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner, the State agency shall require that at least one parent in any such family participate, for a total of at least 16 hours a week during any period in which either parent is required to participate in the program, in a work supplementation program, a community work experience or other work experience program, on-the-job training, or a State designed work program approved by the Secretary, as such programs are described in section 682(d)(1) of this title. In the case of a parent under age 25 who has not completed high school or an equivalent course of education, the State may require such parent to participate in educational activities directed at the attainment of a high school diploma (or equivalent) or another basic education program in lieu of one or more of the programs specified in the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), an individual participating in a community work experience program under section 682 of this title shall be considered to have met the requirement of such clause if he participates for the number of hours in any month equal to the monthly payment of aid to families with dependent children to the family of which he is a member, divided by the greater of the Federal or the applicable State minimum wage (and the portion of such monthly payment for which the State is reimbursed by a child support collection shall not be taken into account in determining the number of hours that such individual may be required to work).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The requirement under subparagraph (A) shall not be considered to have been met by any State if the requirement is not met with respect to the following percentages of all families in the State eligible for aid to families with dependent children by reason of the unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 40 percent, in the case of the average of each month in fiscal year 1994,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) 50 percent, in the case of the average of each month in fiscal year 1995,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 60 percent, in the case of the average of each month in fiscal year 1996, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) 75 percent in the case of the average of each month in each of the fiscal years 1997 and 1998.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The percentage of participants for any month in a fiscal year for purposes of the preceding sentence shall equal the average of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the number of individuals described in subparagraph (A)(i) who have met the requirement prescribed therein, divided by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the total number of principal earners described in such subparagraph (but excluding those in families who have been recipients of aid for 2 months or less if, during the period that the family received aid, at least one parent engaged in intensive job search).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Secretary determines that the State has failed to meet the requirement under subparagraph (A) (determined with respect to the percentages prescribed in subparagraph (B)), he may waive, in whole or in part, any penalty if he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the State is operating a program in conformity with section 602(a)(19) of this title and part F of this subchapter,</p>
