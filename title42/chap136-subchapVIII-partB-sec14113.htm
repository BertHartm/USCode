<p class="note-body">Section 14116 of this title, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was in the original &ldquo;section 200203&rdquo;, and was translated as reading &ldquo;section 200207&rdquo;, meaning section 200207 of Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 200203 of Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, which is classified to section 14112 of this title, does not provide for submission of applications, and section 14116 does so provide.</p>
