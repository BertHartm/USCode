<h4 class="note-head">Establishment of Program To Monitor and Improve Air Quality in Regions Along Border Between United States and Mexico</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 815 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;549 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter referred to as the &lsquo;Administrator&rsquo;) is authorized, in cooperation with the Department of State and the affected States, to negotiate with representatives of Mexico to authorize a program to monitor and improve air quality in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. The program established under this section shall not extend beyond July 1, 1995.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring and Remediation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The monitoring component of the program conducted under this section shall identify and determine sources of pollutants for which national ambient air quality standards (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;NAAQS&rsquo;) and other air quality goals have been established in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. Any such monitoring component of the program shall include, but not be limited to, the collection of meteorological data, the measurement of air quality, the compilation of an emissions inventory, and shall be sufficient to the extent necessary to successfully support the use of a state-of-the-art mathematical air modeling analysis. Any such monitoring component of the program shall collect and produce data projecting the level of emission reductions necessary in both Mexico and the United States to bring about attainment of both primary and secondary NAAQS, and other air quality goals, in regions along the border in the United States. Any such monitoring component of the program shall include to the extent possible, data from monitoring programs undertaken by other parties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Remediation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator is authorized to negotiate with appropriate representatives of Mexico to develop joint remediation measures to reduce the level of airborne pollutants to achieve and maintain primary and secondary NAAQS, and other air quality goals, in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. Such joint remediation measures may include, but not be limited to measures included in the Environmental Protection Agency's Control Techniques and Control Technology documents. Any such remediation program shall also identify those control measures implementation of which in Mexico would be expedited by the use of material and financial assistance of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Annual Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall, each year the program authorized in this section is in operation, report to Congress on the progress of the program in bringing nonattainment areas along the border of the United States into attainment with primary and secondary NAAQS. The report issued by the Administrator under this paragraph shall include recommendations on funding mechanisms to assist in implementation of monitoring and remediation efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Funding and Personnel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may, where appropriate, make available, subject to the appropriations, such funds, personnel, and equipment as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section. In those cases where direct financial assistance of the United States is provided to implement monitoring and remediation programs in Mexico, the Administrator shall develop grant agreements with appropriate representatives of Mexico to assure the accuracy and completeness of monitoring data and the performance of remediation measures which are financed by the United States. With respect to any control measures within Mexico funded by the United States, the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize resources of Mexico where such utilization would reduce costs to the United States. Such funding agreements shall include authorization for the Administrator to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) review and agree to plans for monitoring and remediation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) inspect premises, equipment and records to insure compliance with the agreements established under and the purposes set forth in this section; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) where necessary, develop grant agreements with affected States to carry out the provisions of this section.&rdquo;</p>
