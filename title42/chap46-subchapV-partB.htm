<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subpart is to provide additional Federal financial assistance to public or private agencies and private nonprofit organizations for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) undertaking educational and training programs for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) criminal justice personnel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the general public, with respect to the lawful and safe ownership, storage, carriage, or use of firearms, including the provision of secure gun storage or safety devices;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing technical assistance to States and local units of government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) undertaking projects which are national or multijurisdictional in scope and which address the purposes specified in section 3751(b) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) providing financial assistance to public agencies and private nonprofit organizations for demonstration programs which, in view of previous research or experience, are likely to be a success in more than one jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Grants and contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out this subpart, the Director is authorized to make grants to, or enter into contracts with non-Federal public or private agencies, institutions, or organizations or individuals to carry out any purpose specified in section 3751(b) of this title and is authorized to make grants to, or enter into contracts with, those persons and entities to carry out the purposes specified in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. The Director shall have final authority over all funds awarded under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Firearm safety education grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In accordance with this subsection, the Director may make a grant to, or enter into a contract with, any person or entity referred to in subsection (b) of this section to provide for a firearm safety program that, in a manner consistent with subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, provides for general public training and dissemination of information concerning firearm safety, secure gun storage, and the lawful ownership, carriage, or use of firearms, including the provision of secure gun storage or safety devices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds made available under a grant under paragraph (1) may not be used (either directly or by supplanting non-Federal funds) for advocating or promoting gun control, including making communications that are intended to directly or indirectly affect the passage of Federal, State, or local legislation intended to restrict or control the purchase or use of firearms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in paragraph (4), each firearm safety program that receives funding <!-- PDFPage:4278 -->under this subsection shall provide for evaluations that shall be developed pursuant to guidelines that the Director of the National Institute of Justice of the Department of Justice, in consultation with the Director of the Bureau of Justice Assistance and recognized private entities that have expertise in firearms safety, education and training, shall establish.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) With respect to a firearm safety program that receives funding under this section, the Director may waive the evaluation requirement described in paragraph (3) if the Director determines that the program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is not of a sufficient size to justify an evaluation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is designed primarily to provide material resources and supplies, and that activity would not justify an evaluation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitations as to non-governmental entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No grants or contracts under subsection (b) of this section may be made, entered into, or used, directly or indirectly, to provide any security enhancements or any equipment to any non-governmental entity that is not engaged in law enforcement or law enforcement support, criminal or juvenile justice, or delinquency prevention.</p>
