<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Persons not party to settlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If the United States or a State has obtained less than complete relief from a person who has resolved its liability to the United States or the State in an administrative or judicially approved settlement, the United States or the State may bring an action against any person who has not so resolved its liability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State for some or all of a response action or for some or all of the costs of such action in an administrative or judicially approved settlement may seek contribution from any person who is not party to a settlement referred to in paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In any action under this paragraph, the rights of any person who has resolved its liability to the United States or a State shall be subordinate to the rights of the United States or the State.

<p class="statutory-body">In any action commenced under this chapter or under the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.] in a court of the United States, any person may intervene as a matter of right when such person claims an interest relating to the subject of the action and is so situated that the disposition of the action may, as a practical matter, impair or impede the person's ability to <!-- PDFPage:5987 -->protect that interest, unless the President or the State shows that the person's interest is adequately represented by existing parties.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In considering objections raised in any judicial action under this chapter, the court shall uphold the President's decision in selecting the response action unless the objecting party can demonstrate, on the administrative record, that the decision was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remedy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the court finds that the selection of the response action was arbitrary and capricious or otherwise not in accordance with law, the court shall award (A) only the response costs or damages that are not inconsistent with the national contingency plan, and (B) such other relief as is consistent with the National Contingency Plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Procedural errors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In reviewing alleged procedural errors, the court may disallow costs or damages only if the errors were so serious and related to matters of such central relevance to the action that the action would have been significantly changed had such errors not been made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Administrative record and participation procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Administrative record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President shall establish an administrative record upon which the President shall base the selection of a response action.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Participation procedures</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Removal action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The President shall promulgate regulations in accordance with chapter 5 of title 5 establishing procedures for the appropriate participation of interested persons in the development of the administrative record on which the President will base the selection of removal actions and on which judicial review of removal actions will be based.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Potentially responsible parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The President shall make reasonable efforts to identify and notify potentially responsible parties as early as possible before selection of a response action. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to be a defense to liability.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Notice of actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any action is brought under this chapter in a court of the United States by a plaintiff other than the United States, the plaintiff shall provide a copy of the complaint to the Attorney General of the United States and to the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
