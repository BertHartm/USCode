<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such processes and methods for determining actuarial valuation shall take into account the effect that providing alternative prescription drug coverage (rather than standard prescription drug coverage) has on drug utilization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Responsibilities</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Review of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall review the information filed under subsection (b) of this section for the purpose of conducting negotiations under paragraph (2).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2804 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Negotiation regarding terms and conditions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements for approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may approve a prescription drug plan only if the following requirements are met:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Compliance with requirements</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application of FEHBP standard</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary determines that the portion of the bid submitted under subsection (b) of this section that is attributable to basic prescription drug coverage is supported by the actuarial bases provided under such subsection and reasonably and equitably reflects the revenue requirements (as used for purposes of section 300e&ndash;1(8)(C) of this title) for benefits provided under that plan, less the sum (determined on a monthly per capita basis) of the actuarial value of the reinsurance payments under section 1395w&ndash;115(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Supplemental coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary determines that the portion of the bid submitted under subsection (b) of this section that is attributable to supplemental prescription drug coverage pursuant to section 1395w&ndash;102(a)(2) of this title is supported by the actuarial bases provided under such subsection and reasonably and equitably reflects the revenue requirements (as used for purposes of section 300e&ndash;1(8)(C) of this title) for such coverage under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Use of categories and classes in formularies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may not find that the design of categories and classes within a formulary violates clause (i) if such categories and classes are consistent with guidelines (if any) for such categories and classes established by the United States Pharmacopeia.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall approve a fallback prescription drug plan for a PDP region in a manner so that, if there are any fallback service areas in the region for a year, the fallback prescription drug plan is offered at the same time as prescription drug plans would otherwise be offered.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(V)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395w-111_2_target" name="1395w-111_2">2</a></sup> No national fallback plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;eligible fallback entity&rdquo; means, with respect to all fallback service areas in a PDP region for a contract period, an entity that&mdash;</p>

In calculating such administrative expenses, the Chief Actuary shall use a factor that is based on similar expenses of prescription drug plans that are not fallback prescription drug plans.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as may be appropriate to carry out this section, the terms and conditions of contracts with eligible fallback entities offering fallback prescription drug plans under this subsection shall be the same as the terms and conditions of contracts under this part for prescription drug plans.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Clean claim defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;clean claim&rdquo; means a claim that has no defect or impropriety (including any lack of any required substantiating documentation) or particular circumstance requiring special treatment that prevents timely payment from being made on the claim under this part.</p>

Interest amounts paid under this subparagraph shall not be counted against the administrative costs of a prescription drug plan or treated as allowable risk corridor costs under section 1395w&ndash;115(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Authority not to charge interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may provide that a PDP sponsor is not charged interest under clause (i) in the case where there are exigent circumstances, including natural disasters and other unique and unexpected events, that prevent the timely processing of claims.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Procedures involving claims</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Claim deemed to be clean</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A claim is deemed to be a clean claim if the PDP sponsor involved does not provide notice to the claimant of any deficiency in the claim&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) with respect to claims submitted electronically, within 10 days after the date on which the claim is received; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) with respect to claims submitted otherwise, within 15 days after the date on which the claim is received.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Claim determined to not be a clean claim</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">If a PDP sponsor determines that a submitted claim is not a clean claim, the PDP sponsor shall, not later than the end of the period described in clause (i), notify the claimant of such determination. Such notification shall specify all defects or improprieties in the claim and shall list all additional information or documents necessary for the proper processing and payment of the claim.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Determination after submission of additional information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">A claim is deemed to be a clean claim under this paragraph if the PDP sponsor involved does not provide notice to the claimant of any defect or impropriety in the claim within 10 days of the date on which additional information is received under subclause (I).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2809 --><h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Obligation to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A claim submitted to a PDP sponsor that is not paid or contested by the sponsor within the applicable number of days (as defined in subparagraph (B)) after the date on which the claim is received shall be deemed to be a clean claim and shall be paid by the PDP sponsor in accordance with subparagraph (A).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A determination under this paragraph that a claim submitted by a pharmacy is a clean claim shall not be construed as a positive determination regarding eligibility for payment under this subchapter, nor is it an indication of government approval of, or acquiescence regarding, the claim submitted. The determination shall not relieve any party of civil or criminal liability with respect to the claim, nor does it offer a defense to any administrative, civil, or criminal action with respect to the claim.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Submission of claims by pharmacies located in or contracting with long-term care facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each contract entered into with a PDP sponsor under this part with respect to a prescription drug plan offered by such sponsor shall provide that a pharmacy located in, or having a contract with, a long-term care facility shall have not less than 30 days (but not more than 90 days) to submit claims to the sponsor for reimbursement under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of certain requirements to expand choice</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorizing waiver</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an entity that seeks to offer a prescription drug plan in a State, the Secretary shall waive the requirement of subsection (a)(1) of this section that the entity be licensed in that State if the Secretary determines, based on the application and other evidence presented to the Secretary, that any of the grounds for approval of the application described in paragraph (2) have been met.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to the waiver available under subparagraph (A), the provisions of section 1395w&ndash;27a(d) of this title shall apply to PDP sponsors under this part in a manner similar to the manner in which such provisions apply to MA organizations under part C of this subchapter, except that no application shall be required under paragraph (1)(B) of such section in the case of a State that does not provide a licensing process for such a sponsor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Grounds for approval</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The grounds for approval under this paragraph are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subject to subparagraph (B), the grounds for approval described in subparagraphs (B), (C), and (D) of section 1395w&ndash;25(a)(2) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the application by a State of any grounds other than those required under Federal law.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying subparagraph (A)(i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the ground of approval described in section 1395w&ndash;25(a)(2)(B) of this title is deemed to have been met if the State does not have a licensing process in effect with respect to the PDP sponsor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for plan years beginning before January 1, 2008, if the State does have such a licensing process in effect, such ground for approval described in such section is deemed to have been met upon submission of an application described in such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of waiver procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to an application for a waiver (or a waiver granted) under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the provisions of subpara<!-- PDFPage:2810 -->graphs (E), (F), and (G) of section 1395w&ndash;25(a)(2) of this title shall apply, except that clauses (i) and (ii) of such subparagraph (E) shall not apply in the case of a State that does not have a licensing process described in paragraph (2)(B)(i) in effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) References to certain provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying provisions of section 1395w&ndash;25(a)(2) of this title under paragraphs (2) and (3) of this subsection to prescription drug plans and PDP sponsors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any reference to a waiver application under section 1395w&ndash;25 of this title shall be treated as a reference to a waiver application under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any reference to solvency standards shall be treated as a reference to solvency standards established under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Solvency standards for non-licensed entities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment and publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, shall establish and publish, by not later than January 1, 2005, financial solvency and capital adequacy standards for entities described in paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A PDP sponsor that is not licensed by a State under subsection (a)(1) of this section and for which a waiver application has been approved under subsection (c) of this section shall meet solvency and capital adequacy standards established under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall establish certification procedures for such sponsors with respect to such solvency standards in the manner described in section 1395w&ndash;25(c)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Licensure does not substitute for or constitute certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The fact that a PDP sponsor is licensed in accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section or has a waiver application approved under subsection (c) of this section does not deem the sponsor to meet other requirements imposed under this part for a sponsor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Periodic review and revision of standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may periodically review the standards established under this section and, based on such review, may revise such standards if the Secretary determines such revision to be appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of sections 1395w&ndash;24(g) and 1395w&ndash;26(b)(3) of this title shall apply with respect to PDP sponsors and prescription drug plans under this part in the same manner as such sections apply to MA organizations and MA plans under part C of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reinsurance payment amount</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reinsurance payment amount under this subsection for a part D eligible individual enrolled in a prescription drug plan or MA&ndash;PD plan for a coverage year is an amount equal to 80 percent of the allowable reinsurance costs (as specified in paragraph (2)) attributable to that portion of gross covered prescription drug costs as specified in paragraph (3) incurred in the coverage year after such individual has incurred costs that exceed the annual out-of-pocket threshold specified in section 1395w&ndash;102(b)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allowable reinsurance costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;allowable reinsurance costs&rdquo; means, with respect to gross covered prescription drug costs under a prescription drug plan offered by a PDP sponsor or an MA&ndash;PD plan offered by an MA organization, the part of such costs that are actually paid (net of discounts, chargebacks, and average percentage rebates) by the sponsor or organization or by (or on behalf of) an enrollee under the plan, but in no case more than the part of such costs that would have been paid under the plan if the prescription drug coverage under the plan were basic prescription drug coverage, or, in the case of a plan providing supplemental prescription drug coverage, if such coverage were standard prescription drug coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Gross covered prescription drug costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;gross covered prescription drug costs&rdquo; means, with respect to a part D eligible individual enrolled in a prescription drug plan or MA&ndash;PD plan during a coverage year, the costs incurred under the plan, not including administrative costs, but including costs directly related to the dispensing of covered part D drugs during the year and costs relating to the deductible.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Health status risk adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Establishment of risk adjustors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish an appropriate methodology for adjusting the standardized bid amount under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section to take into account variation in costs for basic prescription drug coverage among prescription drug plans and MA&ndash;PD plans based on the differences in actuarial risk of different enrollees being served. Any such risk adjustment shall be designed in a manner so as not to result in a change in the aggregate amounts payable to such plans under subsection (a)(1) of this section and through that portion of the monthly beneficiary prescription drug premiums described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section and MA monthly prescription drug beneficiary premiums.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the methodology under subparagraph (A), the Secretary may take into account the similar methodologies used under section 1395w&ndash;23(a)(3) of this title to adjust payments to MA organizations for benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Data collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In order to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary shall require&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">At the time of publication of risk adjustment factors under section 1395w&ndash;23(b)(1)(B)(i)(II) of this title, the Secretary shall publish the risk adjusters established under this paragraph for the succeeding year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Geographic adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), for purposes of section 1395w&ndash;113(a)(1)(B)(iii) of this title, the Secretary shall establish an appropriate methodology for adjusting the national average monthly bid amount (computed under section 1395w&ndash;113(a)(4) of this title) to take into account differences in prices for covered part D drugs among PDP regions.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) De minimis rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines that the price variations described in subparagraph (A) among PDP regions are de minimis, the Secretary shall not provide for adjustment under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Budget neutral adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any adjustment under this paragraph shall be applied in a manner so as to not result in a change in the aggregate payments made under this part that would have been made if the Secretary had not applied such adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment methods</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payments under this section shall be based on such a method as the Secretary determines. The Secretary may establish a payment method by which interim payments of amounts under this section are made during a year based on the Secretary's best estimate of amounts that will be payable after obtaining all of the information.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirement for provision of information</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Payments under this section to a PDP sponsor or MA organization are conditioned upon the furnishing to the Secretary, in a form and manner specified by the Secretary, of such information as may be required to carry out this section.</p>
