<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payments into special fund for improvements to achieve compliance with conditions and requirements; certification of compliance by Secretary</h4>

The preceding sentence shall cease to apply when the Secretary determines and certifies that substantially all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of such Service in the United States are in compliance with such conditions and requirements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The annual report of the Secretary which is required by section 1671 of title 25 shall include (along with the matters specified in section 1643 of title 25) a detailed statement of the status of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of the Service in terms of their compliance with the applicable conditions and requirements of this subchapter and of the progress being made by such hospitals and facilities (under plans submitted under subsection (b) of this section and otherwise) toward the achievement of such compliance.</p>
