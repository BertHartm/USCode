<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Petition for treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in section 3421 of this title, whenever any narcotic addict desires to obtain treatment for his addiction, or whenever a related individual has reason to believe that any person is a narcotic addict, such addict or related individual may file a petition with the United States attorney for the district in which such addict or person resides or is found requesting that such addict or person be admitted to a hospital of the Service for treatment of his addiction. Any such petition filed by a narcotic addict shall set forth his name and address and the facts relating to his addiction. Any such <!-- PDFPage:3520 -->petition filed by a related individual with respect to a person believed by such individual to be a narcotic addict shall set forth the name and address of the alleged narcotic addict and the facts or other data on which the petitioner bases his belief that the person with respect to whom the petition is filed is a narcotic addict.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Petition for confinement; consultations respecting availability of facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After considering such petition, the United States attorney shall, if he determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that the person named in such petition is a narcotic addict, and that appropriate State or other facilities are not available to such person, file a petition with the United States district court to commit such person to a hospital of the Service for treatment as provided in this subchapter. In making his determination with respect to the nonavailability of such facilities, the United States attorney shall consult with the Surgeon General, and other appropriate State or local officials.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Order for medical examination and hearing; personal service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of any such petition by a United States attorney, the court may order the patient to appear before it for an examination by physicians as provided under section 3413 of this title and for a hearing, if required, under section 3414 of this title. The court shall cause a copy of such petition and order to be served personally upon the patient by a United States marshal.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">The court shall immediately advise any patient appearing before it pursuant to an order issued under subsection (c) of section 3412 of his right to have (1) counsel at every stage of the judicial proceedings under this subchapter and that, if he is unable because of financial reasons to obtain counsel, the court will, at the patient's request, assign counsel to represent him; and (2) present for consultation during any examination conducted under this section, a qualified physician retained by such patient, but in no event shall such physician be entitled to participate in any such examination or in the making of any report required under this section with respect to such examination. The court shall also advise such patient that if, after an examination and hearing as provided in this subchapter, he is found to be a narcotic addict who is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment, he will be civilly committed to the Surgeon General for treatment; that he may not voluntarily withdraw from such treatment; that the treatment (including posthospitalization treatment and supervision) may last forty-two months; that during treatment he will be confined in an institution; that for a period of three years following his release from confinement he will be under the care and custody of the Surgeon General for treatment and supervision under a posthospitalization program established by the Surgeon General; and that should he fail or refuse to cooperate in such posthospitalization program or be determined by the Surgeon General to have relapsed to the use of narcotic drugs, he may be recommitted for additional confinement in an institution followed by additional posthospitalization treatment and supervision. After so advising the patient, the court shall appoint two qualified physicians, one of whom shall be a psychiatrist, to examine the patient. For the purpose of the examination, the court may order the patient committed for such reasonable period as it shall determine, not to exceed thirty days, to the custody of the Surgeon General for confinement in a suitable hospital or other facility designated by the court. Each physician appointed by the court shall, within such period so determined by the court, examine the patient and file with the court, a written report with respect to such examination. Each such report shall include a statement of the examining physician's conclusions as to whether the patient examined is a narcotic addict and is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment. Upon the filing of such reports, the patient so examined shall be returned to the court for such further proceedings as it may direct under this subchapter. Copies of such reports shall be made available to the patient and his counsel.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If both examining physicians (referred to in section 3413 of this title) conclude in their respective written reports that the patient is not a narcotic addict, or is an addict not likely to be rehabilitated through treatment, the court shall immediately enter an order discharging the patient and dismissing the proceedings under this <!-- PDFPage:3521 -->subchapter. If the written report of either such physician indicates that the patient is a narcotic addict who is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment, or that the physician submitting the report is unable to reach any conclusion by reason of the refusal of the patient to submit to a thorough examination, the court shall promptly set the case for hearing. The court shall cause a written notice of the time and place of such hearing to be served personally upon the patient and his attorney. Such notice shall also inform the patient that upon demand made by him within fifteen days after he has been served, he shall be entitled to have all issues of fact with respect to his alleged narcotic addiction determined by a jury. If no timely demand for a jury is made, the court, in conducting such hearing, shall determine all issues of fact without a jury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Evidence; patient's testimony; examinations and cross-examinations; judicial review of orders of commitment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In conducting any hearing under this subchapter, the court shall receive and consider all relevant evidence and testimony which may be offered, including the contents of the reports referred to in section 3413 of this title. Any patient with respect to whom a hearing is held under this subchapter shall be entitled to testify and to present and cross-examine witnesses. All final orders of commitment under this subchapter shall be subject to review in conformity with the provisions of sections 1254 and 1291 of title 28.</p>
