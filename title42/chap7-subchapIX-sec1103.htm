<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall apply with respect to any amounts described in subparagraph (A)(i), except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in carrying out the provisions of paragraph (2)(B) with respect to such amounts (to determine the portion of such amounts which is to be allocated to a State for a succeeding fiscal year), the ratio to be applied under such provisions shall be the same as the ratio that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any amounts described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) (remaining in the employment security administration account as of the close of any fiscal year specified in such subparagraph) shall, as of the beginning of the succeeding fiscal year, accrue to the Federal unemployment account, without regard to the limit provided in section 1102(a) of this title.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the amount available for transfer to such State's account shall, in lieu of being so transferred, be transferred to the Federal unemployment account as of the beginning of such October 1.

If the Secretary of Labor does not so find and certify to the Secretary of the Treasury before the close of such fiscal year then the amount which was available for transfer to such State's account as of October 1 of such fiscal year shall (as of the close of such fiscal year) become unrestricted as to use as part of the Federal unemployment account.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A State may, pursuant to a specific appropriation made by the legislative body of the State, use money withdrawn from its account in the payment of expenses incurred by it for the administration of its unemployment compensation law and public employment offices if and only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the purposes and amounts were specified in the law making the appropriation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the appropriation law did not authorize the obligation of such money after the close of the two-year period which began on the date of enactment of the appropriation law,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1617 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the money is withdrawn and the expenses are incurred after such date of enactment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D)(i) the appropriation law limits the total amount which may be obligated under such appropriation at any time to an amount which does not exceed, at any such time, the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the aggregate of the amounts transferred to the account of such State pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the aggregate of the amounts used by the State pursuant to this subsection and charged against the amounts transferred to the account of such State, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for purposes of clause (i), amounts used by a State for administration shall be chargeable against transferred amounts at the exact time the obligation is entered into, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the use of the money is accounted for in accordance with standards established by the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any amount allocated to a State under this section for fiscal year 2000, 2001, or 2002 may be used by such State only to pay expenses incurred by it for the administration of its unemployment compensation law, and may be so used by it without regard to any of the conditions prescribed in any of the preceding provisions of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) amounts transferred to the account of a State pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section were used in payment of unemployment benefits to individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the Governor of such State submits a request to the Secretary of Labor that such amounts be restored under this paragraph,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the amounts described in clause (i) shall be restored to the status of funds transferred under subsections (a) and (b) of this section which have not been used by eliminating any charge against amounts so transferred for the use of such amounts in the payment of unemployment benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only to the extent that the amounts described in clause (i) of such subparagraph do not exceed the amount then in the State's account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the State has a balance of advances made to its account under subchapter XII of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Secretary of Labor determines that the requirements of this paragraph are met with respect to any request, the Secretary shall notify the Governor of the State that such requirements are met with respect to such request and the amount restored under this paragraph. Such restoration shall be as of the first day of the first month following the month in which the notification is made.</p>
