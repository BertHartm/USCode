<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation of interim Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may designate a person to act as Administrator under this chapter until the office is filled as provided in this chapter or until the expiration of the first period of sixty days following August 26, 1965, whichever shall first occur. While so acting such person shall receive compensation at the rate provided by this chapter for such office.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effective date of chapter</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this chapter shall take effect on August 26, 1965, unless herein explicitly otherwise provided.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Extension of project eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any requirements of this chapter relating to the eligibility of areas, projects for which applications are pending before the Area Redevelopment Administration on August 26, 1965 shall for a period of one year thereafter be eligible for consideration by the Secretary for such assistance under the provisions of this chapter as he may determine to be appropriate.</p>

Not more than $7,000,000 appropriated to carry out subchapters I and II of this chapter may be expended annually for such projects.</p>
