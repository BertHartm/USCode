<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) what domestic resources should be made available to such a program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) how the ongoing United States Government carbon dioxide assessment program <!-- PDFPage:5258 -->should be modified so as to be of increased utility in providing information and recommendations of the highest possible value to government policy makers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the need for periodic reports to the Congress in conjunction with any long-term program the Office and the Academy may recommend under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Information from other Federal agencies and departments</h4>
