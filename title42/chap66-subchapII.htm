<p class="statutory-body">(B) An individual who is not a low-income person may not become a volunteer under this part if allowing such individual to become a volunteer under this part would prevent a low-income individual from becoming a volunteer under this part or would displace a low-income person from being such a volunteer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Director may not take into consideration or require as a condition of receiving a grant or contract to carry out a project under this part, any applicant for such grant or contract&mdash;</p>
