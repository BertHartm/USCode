Grants may be made only with respect to applications which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) involve activities which can be incorporated into or be closely coordinated with eligible entities&rsquo; ongoing programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) involve significant new combinations of resources or new and innovative approaches involving partnership agreements;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) contain an assurance that the applicant for such grants will obtain an independent, methodologically sound evaluation of the effectiveness of the activities carried out with such grant and will submit such evaluation to the Secretary.</p>

Demonstrations shall include such activities as peer counseling, mentoring, development of job skills, assistance with social skills, community services, family literacy, parenting skills, opportunities for employment or entrepreneurship, and other services designed to assist such at-risk youth to continue their education, to secure meaningful employment, to perform community service, or to pursue other productive alternatives within the community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such grants may be made only with respect to applications that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identify and describe the population to be served, the problems to be addressed, the overall approach and methods of outreach and recruitment to be used, and the services to be provided;</p>
