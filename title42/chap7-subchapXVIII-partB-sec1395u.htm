<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary to enter into contracts with carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to provide for the administration of the benefits under this part with maximum efficiency and convenience for individuals entitled to benefits under this part and for providers of services and other persons furnishing services to such individuals, and with a view to furthering coordination of the administration of the benefits under part A of this subchapter and under this part, the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts with carriers, including carriers with which agreements under section 1395h of this title are in effect, which will perform some or all of the following functions (or, to the extent provided in such contracts, will secure performance thereof by other organizations); and, with respect to any of the following functions which involve payments for physicians&rsquo; services on a reasonable charge basis, the Secretary shall to the extent possible enter into such contracts:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) make determinations of the rates and amounts of payments required pursuant to this part to be made to providers of services and other persons on a reasonable cost or reasonable charge basis (as may be applicable);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) receive, disburse, and account for funds in making such payments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make such audits of the records of providers of services as may be necessary to assure that proper payments are made under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) determine compliance with the requirements of section 1395x(k) of this title as to utilization review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) assist providers of services and other persons who furnish services for which payment may be made under this part in the development of procedures relating to utilization practices, make studies of the effectiveness of such procedures and methods for their improvement, assist in the application of safeguards against unnecessary utilization of services furnished by providers of services and other persons to individuals entitled to benefits under this part, and provide procedures for and assist in arranging, where necessary, the establishment of groups outside hospitals (meeting the requirements of section 1395x(k)(2) of this title) to make reviews of utilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) serve as a channel of communication of information relating to the administration of this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) otherwise assist, in such manner as the contract may provide, in discharging administrative duties necessary to carry out the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applicability of competitive bidding provisions; findings as to financial responsibility, etc., of carrier; contractual duties imposed by contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Contracts with carriers under subsection (a) of this section may be entered into without regard to section 5 of title 41 or any other provision of law requiring competitive bidding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No such contract shall be entered into with any carrier unless the Secretary finds that such carrier will perform its obligations under the contract efficiently and effectively and will meet such requirements as to financial responsibility, legal authority, and other matters as he finds pertinent. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register standards and criteria for the efficient and effective performance of contract obligations under this section, and opportunity shall be provided for public comment prior to implementation. In establishing such standards and criteria, the Secretary shall provide a system to measure a carrier's performance of responsibilities described in paragraph (3)(H), subsection (h) of this section, and section 1395w&ndash;1(e)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395u_1_target" name="1395u_1">1</a></sup> of this title. The Secretary may not require, as a condition of entering into or renewing a contract under this section or under section 1395hh of this title, that a carrier match data obtained other than in its activities under this part with data used in the administration of this part for purposes of identifying situations in which section 1395y(b) of this title may apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall establish standards for evaluating carriers&rsquo; performance of reviews of initial carrier determinations and of fair hearings under paragraph (3)(C), under which a carrier is expected&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to complete such reviews, within 45 days after the date of a request by an individual enrolled under this part for such a review, in 95 percent of such requests, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to make a final determination, within 120 days after the date of receipt of a request by an individual enrolled under this part for a fair hearing under paragraph (3)(C), in 90 percent of such cases.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of residents of nursing facilities who receive services described in clause (i) or <!-- PDFPage:2168 -->(ii) of section 1395x(s)(2)(K) of this title performed by a member of a team, the Secretary shall instruct carriers to develop mechanisms which permit routine payment under this part for up to 1.5 visits per month per resident. In the previous sentence, the term &ldquo;team&rdquo; refers to a physician and includes a physician assistant acting under the supervision of the physician or a nurse practitioner working in collaboration with that physician, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In addition to any other standards and criteria established by the Secretary for evaluating carrier performance under this paragraph relating to avoiding erroneous payments, the carrier shall be subject to standards and criteria relating to the carrier's success in recovering payments made under this part for items or services for which payment has been or could be made under a primary plan (as defined in section 1395y(b)(2)(A) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) With respect to the payment of claims for home health services under this part that, but for the amendments made by section 4611 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, would be payable under part A of this subchapter instead of under this part, the Secretary shall continue administration of such claims through fiscal intermediaries under section 1395h of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each such contract shall provide that the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will take such action as may be necessary to assure that, where payment under this part for a service is on a cost basis, the cost is reasonable cost (as determined under section 1395x(v) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will take such action as may be necessary to assure that, where payment under this part for a service is on a charge basis, such charge will be reasonable and not higher than the charge applicable, for a comparable service and under comparable circumstances, to the policyholders and subscribers of the carrier, and such payment will (except as otherwise provided in section 1395gg(f) of this title) be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) on the basis of an itemized bill; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) on the basis of an assignment under the terms of which (I) the reasonable charge is the full charge for the service, (II) the physician or other person furnishing such service agrees not to charge (and to refund amounts already collected) for services for which payment under this subchapter is denied under section 1320c&ndash;3(a)(2) of this title by reason of a determination under section 1320c&ndash;3(a)(1)(B) of this title, and (III) the physician or other person furnishing such service agrees not to charge (and to refund amounts already collected) for such service if payment may not be made therefor by reason of the provisions of paragraph (1) of section 1395y(a) of this title, and if the individual to whom such service was furnished was without fault in incurring the expenses of such service, and if the Secretary's determination that payment (pursuant to such assignment) was incorrect and was made subsequent to the third year following the year in which notice of such payment was sent to such individual; except that the Secretary may reduce such three-year period to not less than one year if he finds such reduction is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter (except in the case of physicians&rsquo; services and ambulance service furnished as described in section 1395y(a)(4) of this title, other than for purposes of section 1395gg(f) of this title);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but (in the case of bills submitted, or requests for payment made, after March 1968) only if the bill is submitted, or a written request for payment is made in such other form as may be permitted under regulations, no later than the close of the calendar year following the year in which such service is furnished (deeming any service furnished in the last 3 months of any calendar year to have been furnished in the succeeding calendar year);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) will establish and maintain procedures pursuant to which an individual enrolled under this part will be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing by the carrier, in any case where the amount in controversy is at least $100, but less than $500, when requests for payment under this part with respect to services furnished him are denied or are not acted upon with reasonable promptness or when the amount of such payment is in controversy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) will furnish to the Secretary such timely information and reports as he may find necessary in performing his functions under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) will maintain such records and afford such access thereto as the Secretary finds necessary to assure the correctness and verification of the information and reports under subparagraph (D) and otherwise to carry out the purposes of this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) will take such action as may be necessary to assure that where payment under this part for a service rendered is on a charge basis, such payment shall be determined on the basis of the charge that is determined in accordance with this section on the basis of customary and prevailing charge levels in effect at the time the service was rendered or, in the case of services rendered more than 12 months before the year in which the bill is submitted or request for payment is made, on the basis of such levels in effect for the 12-month period preceding such year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) will, for a service that is furnished with respect to an individual enrolled under this part, that is not paid on an assignment-related basis, and that is subject to a limiting charge under section 1395w&ndash;4(g) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) determine, prior to making payment, whether the amount billed for such service exceeds the limiting charge applicable under section 1395w&ndash;4(g)(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) notify the physician, supplier, or other person periodically (but not less often than once every 30 days) of determinations that amounts billed exceeded such applicable limiting charges; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) provide for prompt response to inquiries of physicians, suppliers, and other persons concerning the accuracy of such limiting charges for their services;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) if it makes determinations or payments with respect to physicians&rsquo; services, will implement&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2169 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) programs to recruit and retain physicians as participating physicians in the area served by the carrier, including educational and outreach activities and the use of professional relations personnel to handle billing and other problems relating to payment of claims of participating physicians; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) programs to familiarize beneficiaries with the participating physician program and to assist such beneficiaries in locating participating physicians;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) will submit annual reports to the Secretary describing the steps taken to recover payments made under this part for items or services for which payment has been or could be made under a primary plan (as defined in section 1395y(b)(2)(A) of this title); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J), (K) Repealed. Pub. L. 101&ndash;234, title II, &sect;201(a), Dec. 13, 1989, 103 Stat. 1981;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(L) will monitor and profile physicians&rsquo; billing patterns within each area or locality and provide comparative data to physicians whose utilization patterns vary significantly from other physicians in the same payment area or locality;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and shall contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with this section as the Secretary may find necessary or appropriate. In determining the reasonable charge for services for purposes of this paragraph, there shall be taken into consideration the customary charges for similar services generally made by the physician or other person furnishing such services, as well as the prevailing charges in the locality for similar services. No charge may be determined to be reasonable in the case of bills submitted or requests for payment made under this part after December 31, 1970, if it exceeds the higher of (i) the prevailing charge recognized by the carrier and found acceptable by the Secretary for similar services in the same locality in administering this part on December 31, 1970, or (ii) the prevailing charge level that, on the basis of statistical data and methodology acceptable to the Secretary, would cover 75 percent of the customary charges made for similar services in the same locality during the 12-month period ending on the June 30 last preceding the start of the calendar year in which the service is rendered. In the case of physicians&rsquo; services the prevailing charge level determined for purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence for any twelve-month period (beginning after June 30, 1973) specified in clause (ii) of such sentence may not exceed (in the aggregate) the level determined under such clause for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, or (with respect to physicians&rsquo; services furnished in a year after 1987) the level determined under this sentence (or under any other provision of law affecting the prevailing charge level) for the previous year except to the extent that the Secretary finds, on the basis of appropriate economic index data, that such higher level is justified by year-to-year economic changes. With respect to power-operated wheelchairs for which payment may be made in accordance with section 1395x(s)(6) of this title, charges determined to be reasonable may not exceed the lowest charge at which power-operated wheelchairs are available in the locality. In the case of medical services, supplies, and equipment (including equipment servicing) that, in the judgment of the Secretary, do not generally vary significantly in quality from one supplier to another, the charges incurred after December 31, 1972, determined to be reasonable may not exceed the lowest charge levels at which such services, supplies, and equipment are widely and consistently available in a locality except to the extent and under the circumstances specified by the Secretary. The requirement in subparagraph (B) that a bill be submitted or request for payment be made by the close of the following calendar year shall not apply if (I) failure to submit the bill or request the payment by the close of such year is due to the error or misrepresentation of an officer, employee, fiscal intermediary, carrier, or agent of the Department of Health and Human Services performing functions under this subchapter and acting within the scope of his or its authority, and (II) the bill is submitted or the payment is requested promptly after such error or misrepresentation is eliminated or corrected. Notwithstanding the provisions of the third and fourth sentences preceding this sentence, the prevailing charge level in the case of a physician service in a particular locality determined pursuant to such third and fourth sentences for any calendar year after 1974 shall, if lower than the prevailing charge level for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, in the case of a similar physician service in the same locality by reason of the application of economic index data, be raised to such prevailing charge level for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and shall remain at such prevailing charge level until the prevailing charge for a year (as adjusted by economic index data) equals or exceeds such prevailing charge level. The amount of any charges for outpatient services which shall be considered reasonable shall be subject to the limitations established by regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1395x(v)(1)(K) of this title, and in determining the reasonable charge for such services, the Secretary may limit such reasonable charge to a percentage of the amount of the prevailing charge for similar services furnished in a physician's office, taking into account the extent to which overhead costs associated with such outpatient services have been included in the reasonable cost or charge of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A)(i) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 15-month period beginning July 1, 1984, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) at the time of furnishing the services, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) <!-- PDFPage:2170 -->for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) at the time of furnishing the services, the Secretary shall permit an additional one percentage point increase in the increase otherwise permitted under that sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In determining the maximum allowable prevailing charges which may be recognized consistent with the index described in the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished on or after January 1, 1987, by participating physicians, the Secretary shall treat the maximum allowable prevailing charges recognized as of December 31, 1986, under such sentence with respect to participating physicians as having been justified by economic changes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The reasonable charge for physicians&rsquo; services furnished on or after January 1, 1987, and before January 1, 1992, by a nonparticipating physician shall be no greater than the applicable percent of the prevailing charge levels established under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) (or under any other applicable provision of law affecting the prevailing charge level). In the previous sentence, the term &ldquo;applicable percent&rdquo; means for services furnished (I) on or after January 1, 1987, and before April 1, 1988, 96 percent, (II) on or after April 1, 1988, and before January 1, 1989, 95.5 percent, and (III) on or after January 1, 1989, 95 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 3-month period beginning January 1, 1988, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Before each year (beginning with 1989), the Secretary shall establish a prevailing charge floor for primary care services (as defined in subsection (i)(4) of this section) equal to 60 percent of the estimated average prevailing charge levels based on the best available data (determined, under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) and under paragraph (4), without regard to this clause and without regard to physician specialty) for such service for all localities in the United States (weighted by the relative frequency of the service in each locality) for the year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) Beginning with 1987, the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in subsection (i)(3) of this section) for each year shall be the same for nonparticipating physicians as for participating physicians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 15-month period beginning July 1, 1984, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) at the time of furnishing the services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if the physician was not a participating physician at any time during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if the physician was a participating physician at any time during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, the physician's customary charges shall be determined based upon the physician's actual charges billed during the 12-month period ending on March 31, 1985.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 3-month period beginning January 1, 1988, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services (other than primary care services, as defined in subsection (i)(4) of this section) furnished during 1991, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 9-month period beginning April 1, 1990. In a case in which subparagraph (F) applies (relating to new physicians) so as to limit the customary charges of a physician during 1990 to a percent of prevailing charges, the previous sentence shall not prevent such limit on customary charges under such subparagraph from increasing in 1991 to a higher percent of such prevailing charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during periods beginning after September 30, 1985, the Secretary shall treat the level as set under subparagraph (A)(i) as having fully provided for the economic changes which would have been taken into account but for the limitations contained in subparagraph (A)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) In determining the customary charges for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, or the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987, by a physician who was not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) on September 30, 1985, the Secretary shall not recognize increases in actual charges for services furnished during the 15-month period beginning on July 1, 1984, above the level of the physician's actual charges billed in the 3-month period ending on June 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In determining the customary charges for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) on April 30, 1986, the Secretary shall not recognize increases in actual charges for services furnished during the 7-month period beginning on October 1, 1985, above the level of the physician's actual charges billed during the 3-month period ending on June 30, 1984.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In determining the customary charges for a physicians&rsquo; service furnished on or after January 1, 1988, if a physician was a nonparticipating physician in a previous year (beginning with 1987), the Secretary shall not recognize any amount of such actual charges (for that service furnished during such previous year) that exceeds the maximum allowable actual charge for such service established under subsection (j)(1)(C) of this section.</p>
