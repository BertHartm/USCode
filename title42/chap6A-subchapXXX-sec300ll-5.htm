The amounts held in the Fund are appropriated and shall remain available without fiscal year limitation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to be held for investment on behalf of individuals enrolled in the CLASS program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay the administrative expenses related to the Fund and to investment under subsection (b); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investment of Fund balance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall invest and manage the CLASS Independence Fund in the same manner, and to the same extent, as the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund may be invested and managed under subsections (c), (d), and (e) of section 1395t&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300ll-5_1_target" name="300ll-5_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Board of Trustees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the CLASS Independence Fund, there is hereby created a body to be known as the Board of Trustees of the CLASS Independence Fund (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Board of Trustees&rdquo;) composed of the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, all ex officio, and of two members of the public (both of whom may not be from the same political party), who shall be nominated by the President for a term of 4 years and subject to confirmation by the Senate. A member of the Board of Trustees serving as a member of the public and nominated and confirmed to fill a vacancy occurring during a term shall be nominated and confirmed only for the remainder of such term. An individual nominated and confirmed as a member of the public may serve in such position after the expiration of such member's term until the earlier of the time at which the member's successor takes office or the time at which a report of the Board is first issued under paragraph (2) after the expiration of the member's term. The Secretary of the Treasury shall be the Managing Trustee of the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall meet not less frequently than once each calendar year. A person serving on the Board of Trustees shall not be considered to be a fiduciary and shall not be personally liable for actions taken in such capacity with respect to the Trust Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Duties</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">It shall be the duty of the Board of Trustees to do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Hold the CLASS Independence Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Report to the Congress not later than the first day of April of each year on the operation and status of the CLASS Inde<!-- PDFPage:1386 -->pendence Fund during the preceding fiscal year and on its expected operation and status during the current fiscal year and the next 2 fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Report immediately to the Congress whenever the Board is of the opinion that the amount of the CLASS Independence Fund is not actuarially sound in regards to the projection under section 300<em>ll</em>&ndash;2(b)(1)(B)(i) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Review the general policies followed in managing the CLASS Independence Fund, and recommend changes in such policies, including necessary changes in the provisions of law which govern the way in which the CLASS Independence Fund is to be managed.</p>
