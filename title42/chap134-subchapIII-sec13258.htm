<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the request of a fleet or covered person allocated a credit under this section, the Secretary shall treat the credit as the acquisition of one alternative fueled vehicle of the type for which the credit is allocated in the year designated by that fleet or person when determining whether that fleet or person has complied with this subchapter in the year designated. A credit may be counted toward compliance for only one year.</p>

A transferred credit may be counted toward compliance for only one year.
