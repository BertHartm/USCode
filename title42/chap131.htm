<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, to the extent of amounts approved in appropriations Acts under section 12912 of this title, make grants to States, units of general local government, and nonprofit organizations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Implementation of eligible activities</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Formula allocation</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A single city may receive assistance allocated under subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B). For purposes of allocating amounts under this paragraph for any fiscal year, the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome shall be the number of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control of the Public Health Service as of March 31 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the amounts are appropriated and to be allocated.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Minimum grant</h4>

If allocation under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) would allocate less than $200,000 for any State, the allocation for such State shall be $200,000 and the amount of the increase under this sentence shall be deducted on a pro rata basis from the allocations of the other States, except that a reduction under this subparagraph may not reduce the amount allocated to any eligible entity to less than $200,000.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) States, units of general local government, and nonprofit organizations, to fund special projects of national significance.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Selection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In selecting projects under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider (i) relative numbers of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome cases and per capita acquired immunodeficiency syndrome incidence; (ii) housing needs of eligible persons in the community; (iii) extent of local planning and coordination of housing programs for eligible persons; and (iv) the likelihood of the continuation of State and local efforts.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) National significance projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For the purpose of subparagraph (A)(ii), in selecting projects of national significance the Secretary shall consider (i) the need to assess the effectiveness of a particular model for providing supportive housing for eligible persons; (ii) the innovative nature of the proposed activity; and (iii) the potential replicability of the proposed activity in other similar localities or nationally.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds made available under this section shall be allocated among applications submitted by applicants and approved by the Secretary. Applications for assistance under this section shall be submitted by an applicant in such form and in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary shall establish. Such applications shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a description of the proposed activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of the size and characteristics of the population that would be served by the proposed activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a description of the public and private resources that are expected to be made available in connection with the proposed activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that any property purchased, leased, rehabilitated, renovated, or converted with assistance under this section shall be operated for not less than 10 years for the purpose specified in the application, except as otherwise specified in this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) evidence in a form acceptable to the Secretary that the proposed activities will meet urgent needs that are not being met by available public and private sources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such other information or certifications that the Secretary determines to be necessary to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Additional requirement for metropolitan areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the other requirements of this section, to be eligible for a grant to a metropolitan area under this section, the major city, urban county, and any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that metropolitan area shall establish or designate a governmental agency or organization for receipt and use of amounts received from a grant under this section and shall submit to the Secretary, together with the application under subsection (d) of this section a proposal for the operation of such agency or organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional requirement for city formula grantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the other requirements of this section, to be eligible for a grant pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, a city shall provide such assurances as the Secretary may require that any grant amounts received will be allocated among eligible activities in a manner that addresses the needs within the metropolitan statistical area in which the city is located, including areas not within the jurisdiction of the city.
