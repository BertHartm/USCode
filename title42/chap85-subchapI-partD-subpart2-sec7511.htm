<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Classification and attainment dates for 1989 nonattainment areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each area designated nonattainment for ozone pursuant to section 7407(d) of this title shall be classified at the time of such designation, under table 1, by operation of law, as a Marginal Area, a Moderate Area, a Serious Area, a Severe Area, or an Extreme Area based on the design value for the area. The design value shall be calculated according to the interpretation methodology issued by the Administrator most recently before November 15, 1990. For each area classified under this subsection, the primary standard attainment date for ozone shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the date provided in table 1.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding table 1, in the case of a severe area with a 1988 ozone design value between 0.190 and 0.280 ppm, the attainment date shall be 17 years (in lieu of 15 years) after November 15, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the time of publication of the notice under section 7407(d)(4) of this title (relating to area designations) for each ozone nonattainment area, the Administrator shall publish a notice announcing the classification of such ozone nonattainment area. The provisions of section 7502(a)(1)(B) of this title (relating to lack of notice and comment and judicial review) shall apply to such classification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an area classified under paragraph (1) (Table 1) would have been classified in another category if the design value in the area were 5 percent greater or 5 percent less than the level on which such classification was based, the Administrator may, in the Administrator's discretion, within 90 days after the initial classification, by the procedure required under paragraph (3), adjust the classification to place the area in such other category. In making such adjustment, the Administrator may consider the number of exceedances of the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone in the area, the level of pollution transport between the area and other affected areas, including both intrastate and interstate transport, and the mix of sources and air pollutants in the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Upon application by any State, the Administrator may extend for 1 additional year (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Extension Year&rdquo;) the date specified in table 1 of paragraph (1) of this subsection if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State has complied with all requirements and commitments pertaining to the area in the applicable implementation plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) no more than 1 exceedance of the national ambient air quality standard level for ozone has occurred in the area in the year preceding the Extension Year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No more than 2 one-year extensions may be issued under this paragraph for a single nonattainment area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) New designations and reclassifications</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) New designations to nonattainment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any area that is designated attainment or unclassifiable for ozone under section 7407(d)(4) of this title, and that is subsequently redesignated to nonattainment for ozone under section 7407(d)(3) of this title, shall, at the time of the redesignation, be classified by operation of law in accordance with table 1 under subsection (a) of this section. Upon its classification, the area shall be subject to the same requirements under section 7410 of this <!-- PDFPage:5652 -->title, subpart 1 of this part, and this subpart that would have applied had the area been so classified at the time of the notice under subsection (a)(3) of this section, except that any absolute, fixed date applicable in connection with any such requirement is extended by operation of law by a period equal to the length of time between November 15, 1990, and the date the area is classified under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reclassification upon failure to attain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Within 6 months following the applicable attainment date (including any extension thereof) for an ozone nonattainment area, the Administrator shall determine, based on the area's design value (as of the attainment date), whether the area attained the standard by that date. Except for any Severe or Extreme area, any area that the Administrator finds has not attained the standard by that date shall be reclassified by operation of law in accordance with table 1 of subsection (a) of this section to the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the next higher classification for the area, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the classification applicable to the area's design value as determined at the time of the notice required under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No area shall be reclassified as Extreme under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register, no later than 6 months following the attainment date, identifying each area that the Administrator has determined under subparagraph (A) as having failed to attain and identifying the reclassification, if any, described under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Voluntary reclassification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall grant the request of any State to reclassify a nonattainment area in that State in accordance with table 1 of subsection (a) of this section to a higher classification. The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register of any such request and of action by the Administrator granting the request.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure of Severe Areas to attain standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If any Severe Area fails to achieve the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone by the applicable attainment date (including any extension thereof), the fee provisions under section 7511d of this title shall apply within the area, the percent reduction requirements of section 7511a(c)(2)(B) and (C) of this title (relating to reasonable further progress demonstration and NO<sub>x</sub> control) shall continue to apply to the area, and the State shall demonstrate that such percent reduction has been achieved in each 3-year interval after such failure until the standard is attained. Any failure to make such a demonstration shall be subject to the sanctions provided under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (A), if the ozone design value for a Severe Area referred to in subparagraph (A) is above 0.140 ppm for the year of the applicable attainment date, or if the area has failed to achieve its most recent milestone under section 7511a(g) of this title, the new source review requirements applicable under this subpart in Extreme Areas shall apply in the area and the term&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7511_1_target" name="7511_1">1</a></sup> &ldquo;major source&rdquo; and &ldquo;major stationary source&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as in Extreme Areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (A) for those areas referred to in subparagraph (A) and not covered by subparagraph (B), the provisions referred to in subparagraph (B) shall apply after 3 years from the applicable attainment date unless the area has attained the standard by the end of such 3-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If, after November 15, 1990, the Administrator modifies the method of determining compliance with the national primary ambient air quality standard, a design value or other indicator comparable to 0.140 in terms of its relationship to the standard shall be used in lieu of 0.140 for purposes of applying the provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) References to terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any reference in this subpart to a &ldquo;Marginal Area&rdquo;, a &ldquo;Moderate Area&rdquo;, a &ldquo;Serious Area&rdquo;, a &ldquo;Severe Area&rdquo;, or an &ldquo;Extreme Area&rdquo; shall be considered a reference to a Marginal Area, a Moderate Area, a Serious Area, a Severe Area, or an Extreme Area as respectively classified under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any reference in this subpart to &ldquo;next higher classification&rdquo; or comparable terms shall be considered a reference to the classification related to the next higher set of design values in table 1.</p>
