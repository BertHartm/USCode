<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Per diem limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments which may be made under this subchapter with respect to routine service costs of extended care services shall not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of health services) per diem costs of such services to the extent that such per diem costs exceed the following per diem limits, except as otherwise provided in this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) With respect to freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas, the limit shall be equal to 112 percent of the mean per diem routine service costs for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) With respect to freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas, the limit shall be equal to 112 percent of the mean per diem routine service costs for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) With respect to hospital-based skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas, the limit shall be equal to the sum of the limit for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas, plus 50 percent of the amount by which 112 percent of the mean per diem routine service costs for hospital-based skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas exceeds the limit for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) With respect to hospital-based skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas, the limit shall be equal to the sum of the limit for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas, plus 50 percent of the amount by which 112 percent of the mean per diem routine service costs for hospital-based skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas exceeds the limit for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In applying this subsection the Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments to the labor related portion of the costs based upon an appropriate wage index, and shall, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1992, on or after October 1, 1995, and every 2 years thereafter, provide for an update to the per diem cost limits described in this subsection, except that the limits effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, shall be based on the limits effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Excess overhead allocations for hospital-based facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a hospital-based skilled nursing facility, the Secretary may not recognize as reasonable the portion of the cost differences between hospital-based and freestanding skilled nursing facilities attributable to excess overhead allocations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments in limitations; publication of data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make adjustments in the limits set forth in subsection (a) of this section <!-- PDFPage:2742 -->with respect to any skilled nursing facility to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate, based upon case mix or circumstances beyond the control of the facility. The Secretary shall publish the data and criteria to be used for purposes of this subsection on an annual basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Access to skilled nursing facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to subsection (e) of this section, any skilled nursing facility may choose to be paid under this subsection on the basis of a prospective payment for all routine service costs (including the costs of services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident eligible for benefits under this subchapter) and capital-related costs of extended care services provided in a cost reporting period if such facility had, in the preceding cost reporting period, fewer than 1,500 patient days with respect to which payments were made under this subchapter. Such prospective payment shall be in lieu of payments which would otherwise be made for routine service costs pursuant to section 1395x(v) of this title and subsections (a) through (c) of this section and capital-related costs pursuant to section 1395x(v) of this title. This subsection shall not apply to a facility for any cost reporting period immediately following a cost reporting period in which such facility had 1,500 or more patient days with respect to which payments were made under this subchapter, without regard to whether payments were made under this subsection during such preceding cost reporting period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the payment under this section shall be determined on a per diem basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to the limitations of subparagraph (C), for skilled nursing facilities located&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in an urban area, the amount shall be equal to 105 percent of the mean of the per diem reasonable routine service and capital-related costs of extended care services for skilled nursing facilities in urban areas within the same region, determined without regard to the limitations of subsection (a) of this section and adjusted for different area wage levels, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in a rural area the amount shall be equal to 105 percent of the mean of the per diem reasonable routine service and capital-related costs of extended care services for skilled nursing facilities in rural areas within the same region, determined without regard to the limitations of subsection (a) of this section and adjusted for different area wage levels.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The per diem amounts determined under subparagraph (B) shall not exceed the limit on routine service costs determined under subsection (a) of this section with respect to the facility, adjusted to take into account average capital-related costs with respect to the type and location of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, urban and rural areas shall be determined in the same manner as for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, and the term &ldquo;region&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as under section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall establish the prospective payment amounts for cost reporting periods beginning in a fiscal year at least 90 days prior to the beginning of such fiscal year, on the basis of the most recent data available for a 12-month period. A skilled nursing facility must notify the Secretary of its intention to be paid pursuant to this subsection for a cost reporting period no later than 30 days before the beginning of that period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall provide for a simplified cost report to be filed by facilities being paid pursuant to this subsection, which shall require only the cost information necessary for determining prospective payment amounts pursuant to paragraph (2) and reasonable costs of ancillary services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In lieu of payment on a cost basis for ancillary services provided by a facility which is being paid pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary may pay for such ancillary services on a reasonable charge basis if the Secretary determines that such payment basis will provide an equitable level of reimbursement and will ease the reporting burden of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) In computing the rates of payment to be made under this subsection, there shall be taken into account the costs described in the last sentence of section 1395x(v)(1)(E) of this title (relating to compliance with nursing facility requirements and of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs and competency evaluation programs).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prospective payment</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determining base payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall determine, on a per diem basis, the total of&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2744 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the allowable costs of extended care services for the facility for cost reporting periods beginning in fiscal year 1995, including costs associated with facilities described in subsection (d) of this section, with appropriate adjustments (as determined by the Secretary) to non-settled cost reports or, in the case of a facility participating in the Nursing Home Case-Mix and Quality Demonstration (RUGS&ndash;III), the RUGS&ndash;III rate received by the facility during the cost reporting period beginning in 1997, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall update the amount determined under subparagraph (A), for each cost reporting period after the cost reporting period described in subparagraph (A)(i) and up to the first cost reporting period by a factor equal to the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage increase reduced (on an annualized basis) by 1 percentage point.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Computation of standardized per diem rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall standardize the amount updated under subparagraph (B) for each facility by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) adjusting for variations among facilities by area in the average facility wage level per diem, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) adjusting for variations in case mix per diem among facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Computation of weighted average per diem rates</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) All facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall compute a weighted average per diem rate for all facilities by computing an average of the standardized amounts computed under subparagraph (C), weighted for each facility by the number of days of extended care services furnished during the cost reporting period referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Freestanding facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall compute a weighted average per diem rate for freestanding facilities by computing an average of the standardized amounts computed under subparagraph (C) only for such facilities, weighted for each facility by the number of days of extended care services furnished during the cost reporting period referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Separate computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may compute and apply such averages separately for facilities lo<!-- PDFPage:2745 -->cated in urban and rural areas (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Updating</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Initial period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For the initial period beginning on July 1, 1998, and ending on September 30, 1999, the Secretary shall compute for skilled nursing facilities an unadjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the average of the weighted average per diem rates computed under clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (D), increased by skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for such period minus 1 percentage point.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Subsequent fiscal years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall compute an unadjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the Federal per diem rate computed under this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for fiscal year 2000, the rate computed for the initial period described in clause (i), increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the initial period minus 1 percentage point;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for fiscal year 2001, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year involved minus 0.5 percentage points; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) for each subsequent fiscal year, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year involved.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Adjustment for case mix creep</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments under subparagraph (G)(i) for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of residents that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary may adjust unadjusted Federal per diem rates for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Determination of Federal rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute for each skilled nursing facility for each fiscal year (beginning with the initial period described in subparagraph (E)(i)) an adjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the unadjusted Federal per diem rate determined under subparagraph (E), as adjusted under subparagraph (F), and as further adjusted as follows:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Adjustment for case mix</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate adjustment to account for case mix. Such adjustment shall be based on a resident classification system, established by the Secretary, that accounts for the relative resource utilization of different patient types. The case mix adjustment shall be based on resident assessment data and other data that the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjustment for geographic variations in labor costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall adjust the portion of such per diem rate attributable to wages and wage-related costs for the area in which the facility is located compared to the national average of such costs using an appropriate wage index as determined by the Secretary. Such adjustment shall be done in a manner that does not result in aggregate payments under this subsection that are greater or less than those that would otherwise be made if such adjustment had not been made.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustment for exclusion of certain additional items and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate proportional reduction in payments so that beginning with fiscal year 2001, the aggregate amount of such reductions is equal to the aggregate increase in payments attributable to the exclusion effected under clause (iii) of paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Publication of information on per diem rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, before May 1, 1998 (with respect to fiscal period described in subparagraph (E)(i)) and before the August 1 preceding each succeeding fiscal year (with respect to that succeeding fiscal year), of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the unadjusted Federal per diem rates to be applied to days of covered skilled nursing facility services furnished during the fiscal year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the case mix classification system to be applied under subparagraph (G)(i) with respect to such services during the fiscal year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the factors to be applied in making the area wage adjustment under subparagraph (G)(ii) with respect to such services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Skilled nursing facility market basket index and percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Skilled nursing facility market basket index</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish a skilled nursing facility market basket index that reflects changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in covered skilled nursing facility services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Skilled nursing facility market basket percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;skilled nursing facility market basket percentage&rdquo; means, for a fiscal year <!-- PDFPage:2746 -->or other annual period and as calculated by the Secretary, the percentage change in the skilled nursing facility market basket index (established under subparagraph (A)) from the midpoint of the prior fiscal year (or period) to the midpoint of the fiscal year (or other period) involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Submission of resident assessment data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A skilled nursing facility, or a facility described in paragraph (7)(B), shall provide the Secretary, in a manner and within the timeframes prescribed by the Secretary, the resident assessment data necessary to develop and implement the rates under this subsection. For purposes of meeting such requirement, a skilled nursing facility, or a facility described in paragraph (7), may submit the resident assessment data required under section 1395i&ndash;3(b)(3) of this title, using the standard instrument designated by the State under section 1395i&ndash;3(e)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Treatment of medicare swing bed hospitals</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Transition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall determine an appropriate manner in which to apply this subsection to the facilities described in subparagraph (B) (other than critical access hospitals), taking into account the purposes of this subsection, and shall provide that at the end of the transition period (as defined in paragraph (2)(E)) such facilities shall be paid only under this subsection. Payment shall not be made under this subsection to such facilities for cost reporting periods beginning before such date (not earlier than July 1, 1999) as the Secretary specifies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Facilities described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The facilities described in this subparagraph are facilities that have in effect an agreement described in section 1395tt of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exemption from PPS of swing-bed services furnished in critical access hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The prospective payment system established under this subsection shall not apply to services furnished by a critical access hospital pursuant to an agreement under section 1395tt of this title.</p>
