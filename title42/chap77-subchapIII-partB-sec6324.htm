Prior to amendment, section read as follows: &ldquo;Upon the basis of the reports submitted pursuant to this part and such other information as is available, the Secretary shall, at the earliest practicable date, set an energy conservation goal for each State for 1980 and may set interim goals. Such goal or goals shall consist of the maximum reduction in the consumption of energy during any year as a result of the implementation of the State energy conservation plan described in section 6322(b) of this title which is consistent with technological feasibility, financial resources, and economic objectives, by comparison with the projected energy consumption for such State in such year. The Secretary shall specify the assumptions used in the determination of the projected energy consumption in each State, taking into account population trends, economic growth, and the effects of national energy conservation programs.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">1978&mdash;Pub. L. 95&ndash;619 substituted &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; for &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;, meaning Administrator of the Federal Energy Administration, wherever appearing.</p>
