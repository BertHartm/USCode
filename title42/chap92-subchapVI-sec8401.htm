<p class="statutory-body">(1) In accordance with such criteria and guidelines as the Secretary of Agriculture shall, by <!-- PDFPage:5694 -->rule, prescribe, the Governor of any State may designate any area within such State for the purposes of this section, if he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) either (i) employment in coal or uranium production development activities in such area has increased for the most recent calendar year by 8 percent or more from the immediately preceding year or (ii) employment in such activities will increase 8 percent or more per year during each of the 3 calendar years beginning after the date of such finding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such employment increase has required or will require substantial increases in housing or public facilities and services or a combination of both in such area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the State and the local government or governments serving such area lack the financial and other resources to meet any such increases in public facilities and services within a reasonable time.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(C), increased revenues, including severance tax revenues, royalties, and similar fees to the State and local governments which are associated with the increase in coal or uranium development activities and which are not prohibited from being used under provisions of law in effect on November 9, 1978, shall be taken into account in determining if a State or local government lacks financial resources.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Governor of the State making the designation provides the Secretary in writing with the data and information on which such designation was made, together with such additional information as the Secretary may require to carry out the purposes of this section; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary of Agriculture may acquire such real property or interest therein, by purchase, donation, lease, or exchange.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of Agriculture shall prescribe, by rule, criteria for the allocation of assistance under this section.
