<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority to provide designated housing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a public housing agency whose allocation plan under subsection (f) of this section (and any biannual update) has been approved by the Secretary may, to the extent provided in the allocation plan, provide public housing projects (or portions of projects) designated for occupancy by (A) only elderly families, (B) only disabled families (subject to the provisions of subsection (e) of this section), or (C) elderly and disabled families.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priority for occupancy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining priority for admission to public housing projects (or portions of projects) that are designated for occupancy as provided in paragraph (1), the public housing agency may make units in such projects (or portions) available only to the types of families for whom the project is designated. Among such types of families, preference for occupancy in such projects (or portions) shall be given according to the preferences for occupancy under section 1437d(c)(4)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Eligibility of near-elderly families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a public housing agency determines (in accordance with regulations established by the Secretary) that there are insufficient numbers of elderly families to fill all the units in a project (or portion of a project) designated under paragraph (1) for occupancy by only elderly families, the agency may (pursuant to the approved allocation plan under subsection (f) of this section for the agency) provide that near-elderly families who qualify for preferences for occupancy under section 1437d(c)(4)(A) of this title may occupy dwelling units in the project (or portion).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Vacancy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding the authority under paragraphs (1) and (2) to designate public housing projects (or portions of projects) for occupancy by only certain types of families, a public housing agency shall make any dwelling unit that is ready for occupancy in such a project (or portion of a project) that has been vacant for more than 60 consecutive days generally available for occupancy (subject to the requirements of this subchapter) without regard to such designation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability of housing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Tenant choice</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Discriminatory selection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to any family who decides not to occupy or accept an appropriate dwelling unit in public housing or to accept assistance under this chapter on the basis of the race, color, religion, sex, disability, familial status, or national origin of occupants of housing or the surrounding area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Appropriateness of dwelling units</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">Any tenant who is lawfully residing in a dwelling unit in the project may not be evicted or otherwise required to vacate such unit because of the designation of the project (or portion of a project) or because of any action taken by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or any public housing agency pursuant to this section.</p>
