Such services may include services by individuals serving as foster grandparents to children who are individuals with disabilities, who have chronic health conditions, who are receiving care in hospitals, who are residing in homes for dependent and neglected children, or who are receiving services provided by day care centers, schools, early intervention programs under part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.), Head Start agencies under the Head Start Act [42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.], or other programs, establishments, and institutions providing services for children having special or exceptional needs or circumstances identified as limiting their academic, social, or emotional development. Individual foster grandparents may provide person-to-person services to one or more children, depending on the needs of the project and local site. The Director may approve assistance in excess of 90 per centum of the costs of the development and operation of such projects only if the Director determines, in accordance with regulations the Director shall prescribe establishing objective criteria, that such action is required in furtherance of the purpose of this section.
