<h3 class="section-head">&sect;14801. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Each year more than 2,000,000 poisonings are reported to poison control centers throughout the United States. More than 90 percent of these poisonings happen in the home. Fifty-three percent of poisoning victims are children younger than 6 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Poison control centers are a valuable national resource that provide life-saving and cost-effective public health services. For every dollar spent on poison control centers, $7 in medical costs are saved. The average cost of a poisoning exposure call is $32, while the average cost if other parts of the medical system are involved is $932. Over the last 2 decades, the instability and lack of funding has resulted in a steady decline in the number of poison control centers in the United States. Within just the last year, 2 poison control centers have been forced to close because of funding problems. A third poison control center is scheduled to close in April 1999. Currently, there are 73 such centers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing accessibility to poison control centers will increase the number of United States residents who have access to a certified poison control center, and reduce the inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other more costly health care services.</p>
