<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 270 days after October 14, 2008, the Secretary shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of Representatives a report on the acquisition strategy adopted pursuant to subsection (a).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review of acquisition strategy</h4>
