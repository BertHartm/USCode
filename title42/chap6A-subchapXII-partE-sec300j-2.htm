<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Public water systems supervision programs; applications for grants; allotment of sums; waiver of grant restrictions; notice of approval or disapproval of application; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From allotments made pursuant to paragraph (4), the Administrator may make grants to States to carry out public water system supervision programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No grant may be made under paragraph (1) unless an application therefor has been submitted to the Administrator in such form and manner as he may require. The Administrator may not approve an application of a State for its first grant under paragraph (1) unless he determines that the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has established or will establish within one year from the date of such grant a public water system supervision program, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will, within that one year, assume primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No grant may be made to a State under paragraph (1) for any period beginning more than one year after the date of the State's first grant unless the State has assumed and maintains primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State. The prohibitions contained in the preceding two sentences shall not apply to such grants when made to Indian Tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A grant under paragraph (1) shall be made to cover not more than 75 per centum of the grant recipient's costs (as determined under regulations of the Administrator) in carrying out, during the one-year period beginning on the date the grant is made, a public water system supervision program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In each fiscal year the Administrator shall, in accordance, with regulations, allot the sums appropriated for such year under paragraph (5) among the States on the basis of population, geographical area, number of public water systems, and other relevant factors. No State shall receive less than 1 per centum of the annual appropriation for grants under paragraph (1): <em>Provided</em>, That the Administrator may, by regulation, reduce such percentage in accordance with the criteria specified in this paragraph: <em>And provided further</em>, That such percentage shall not apply to grants allotted to Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The prohibition contained in the last sentence of paragraph (2) may be waived by the Administrator with respect to a grant to a State through fiscal year 1979 but such prohibition may only be waived if, in the judgment of the Administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State is making a diligent effort to assume and maintain primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State has made significant progress toward assuming and maintaining such primary enforcement responsibility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there is reason to believe the State will assume such primary enforcement responsibility by October 1, 1979.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of any grant awarded for the fiscal years 1978 and 1979 pursuant to a waiver under <!-- PDFPage:1016 -->this paragraph may not exceed 75 per centum of the allotment which the State would have received for such fiscal year if it had assumed and maintained such primary enforcement responsibility. The remaining 25 per centum of the amount allotted to such State for such fiscal year shall be retained by the Administrator, and the Administrator may award such amount to such State at such time as the State assumes such responsibility before the beginning of fiscal year 1980. At the beginning of each fiscal years 1979 and 1980 the amounts retained by the Administrator for any preceding fiscal year and not awarded by the beginning of fiscal year 1979 or 1980 to the States to which such amounts were originally allotted may be removed from the original allotment and reallotted for fiscal year 1979 or 1980 (as the case may be) to States which have assumed primary enforcement responsibility by the beginning of such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Administrator shall notify the State of the approval or disapproval of any application for a grant under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within ninety days after receipt of such application, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not later than the first day of the fiscal year for which the grant application is made,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purpose of making grants under paragraph (1), there are authorized to be appropriated $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1997 through 2003.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) <cap-smallcap>Reservation of funds by the administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator assumes the primary enforcement responsibility of a State public water system supervision program, the Administrator may reserve from funds made available pursuant to this subsection an amount equal to the amount that would otherwise have been provided to the State pursuant to this subsection. The Administrator shall use the funds reserved pursuant to this paragraph to ensure the full and effective administration of a public water system supervision program in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) <cap-smallcap>State loan funds.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Reservation of funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any fiscal year for which the amount made available to the Administrator by appropriations to carry out this subsection is less than the amount that the Administrator determines is necessary to supplement funds made available pursuant to paragraph (8) to ensure the full and effective administration of a public water system supervision program in a State, the Administrator may reserve from the funds made available to the State under section 300j&ndash;12 of this title (relating to State loan funds) an amount that is equal to the amount of the shortfall. This paragraph shall not apply to any State not exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems as of August 6, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Duty of administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator reserves funds from the allocation of a State under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall carry out in the State each of the activities that would be required of the State if the State had primary enforcement authority under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Underground water source protection programs; applications for grants; allotment of sums; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From allotments made pursuant to paragraph (4), the Administrator may make grants to States to carry out underground water source protection programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No grant may be made under paragraph (1) unless an application therefor has been submitted to the Administrator in such form and manner as he may require. No grant may be made to any State under paragraph (1) unless the State has assumed primary enforcement responsibility within two years after the date the Administrator promulgates regulations for State underground injection control programs under section 300h of this title. The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall not apply to such grants when made to Indian Tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A grant under paragraph (1) shall be made to cover not more than 75 per centum of the grant recipient's cost (as determined under regulations of the Administrator) in carrying out, during the one-year period beginning on the date the grant is made, and underground water source protection program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In each fiscal year the Administrator shall, in accordance with regulations, allot the sums appropriated for such year under paragraph (5) among the States on the basis of population, geographical area, and other relevant factors.</p>
