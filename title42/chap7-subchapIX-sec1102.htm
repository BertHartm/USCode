<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) $550 million, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount (determined by the Secretary of Labor and certified by him to the Secretary of the Treasury) equal to 0.5 percent of the total wages subject (determined without any limitation on amount) to contributions under all State unemployment compensation laws for the calendar year ending during the fiscal year for which the excess is determined.</p>
