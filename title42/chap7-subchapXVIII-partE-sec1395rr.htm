<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Type, duration, and scope of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The benefits provided by parts A and B of this subchapter shall include benefits for individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease as provided in section 426&ndash;1 of this title, and benefits for kidney donors as provided in subsection (d) of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the type, duration, and scope of the benefit provided by parts A and B of this subchapter with respect to individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease and who are entitled to such benefits without regard to section 426&ndash;1 of this title shall in no case be less than the type, duration, and scope of the benefits so provided for individuals entitled to such benefits solely by reason of that section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments with respect to services; dialysis; regulations; physicians&rsquo; services; target reimbursement rates; home dialysis supplies and equipment; self-care home dialysis support services; self-care dialysis units; hepatitis B vaccine</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payments under this subchapter with respect to services, in addition to services for which payment would otherwise be made under this subchapter, furnished to individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease shall include (A) payments on behalf of such individuals to providers of services and renal dialysis facilities which meet such requirements as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe for institutional dialysis services and supplies (including self-dialysis services in a self-care dialysis unit maintained by the provider or facility), transplantation services, self-care home dialysis support services which are furnished by the provider or facility, and routine professional services performed by a physician during a maintenance dialysis episode if payments for his other professional services furnished to an individual who has end stage renal disease are made on the basis specified in paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection, (B) payments to or on behalf of such individuals for home dialysis supplies and equipment, and (C) payments to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician for self-administered erythropoietin as described in section 1395x(s)(2)(P)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395rr_1_target" name="1395rr_1">1</a></sup> of this title if the Secretary finds that the patient receiving such drug from such a supplier can safely and effectively administer the drug (in accordance with the applicable methods and standards established by the Secretary pursuant to such section). The requirements prescribed by the Secretary under sub<!-- PDFPage:2713 -->paragraph (A) shall include requirements for a minimum utilization rate for transplantations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to payments for dialysis services furnished by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease for which payments may be made under part B of this subchapter, such payments (unless otherwise provided in this section) shall be equal to 80 percent of the amounts determined in accordance with subparagraph (B); and with respect to payments for services for which payments may be made under part A of this subchapter, the amounts of such payments (which amounts shall not exceed, in respect to costs in procuring organs attributable to payments made to an organ procurement agency or histocompatibility laboratory, the costs incurred by that agency or laboratory) shall be determined in accordance with section 1395x(v) of this title or section 1395ww of this title (if applicable). Payments shall be made to a renal dialysis facility only if it agrees to accept such payments as payment in full for covered services, except for payment by the individual of 20 percent of the estimated amounts for such services calculated on the basis established by the Secretary under subparagraph (B) and the deductible amount imposed by section 1395<em>l</em>(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations any methods and procedures to (i) determine the costs incurred by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities in furnishing covered services to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease, and (ii) determine, on a cost-related basis or other economical and equitable basis (including any basis authorized under section 1395x(v) of this title) and consistent with any regulations promulgated under paragraph (7), the amounts of payments to be made for part B services furnished by such providers and facilities to such individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Such regulations, in the case of services furnished by proprietary providers and facilities (other than hospital outpatient departments) may include, if the Secretary finds it feasible and appropriate, provision for recognition of a reasonable rate of return on equity capital, providing such rate of return does not exceed the rate of return stipulated in section 1395x(v)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of section 1395<em>oo</em> of this title, a renal dialysis facility shall be treated as a provider of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to payments for physicians&rsquo; services furnished to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease, the Secretary shall pay 80 percent of the amounts calculated for such services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on a reasonable charge basis (but may, in such case, make payment on the basis of the prevailing charges of other physicians for comparable services or, for services furnished on or after January 1, 1992, on the basis described in section 1395w&ndash;4 of this title) except that payment may not be made under this subparagraph for routine services furnished during a maintenance dialysis episode, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) on a comprehensive monthly fee or other basis (which effectively encourages the efficient delivery of dialysis services and provides incentives for the increased use of home dialysis) for an aggregate of services provided over a period of time (as defined in regulations).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Pursuant to agreements with approved providers of services and renal dialysis facilities, the Secretary may make payments to such providers and facilities for the cost of home dialysis supplies and equipment and self-care home dialysis support services furnished to patients whose self-care home dialysis is under the direct supervision of such provider or facility, on the basis of a target reimbursement rate (as defined in paragraph (6)) or on the basis of a method established under paragraph (7).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make payments to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment furnished to a patient whose self-care home dialysis is not under the direct supervision of an approved provider of services or renal dialysis facility only in accordance with a written agreement under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the patient certifies that the supplier is the sole provider of such supplies and equipment to the patient,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the supplier agrees to receive payment for the cost of such supplies and equipment only on an assignment-related basis, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the supplier certifies that it has entered into a written agreement with an approved provider of services or renal dialysis facility under which such provider or facility agrees to furnish to such patient all self-care home dialysis support services and all other necessary dialysis services and supplies, including institutional dialysis services and supplies and emergency services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An agreement under paragraph (4) shall require, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that the provider or facility will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) assume full responsibility for directly obtaining or arranging for the provision of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such medically necessary dialysis equipment as is prescribed by the attending physician;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) dialysis equipment maintenance and repair services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the purchase and delivery of all necessary medical supplies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) where necessary, the services of trained home dialysis aides;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) perform all such administrative functions and maintain such information and records as the Secretary may require to verify the transactions and arrangements described in subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) submit such cost reports, data, and information as the Secretary may require with respect to the costs incurred for equipment, supplies, and services furnished to the facility's home dialysis patient population; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provide for full access for the Secretary to all such records, data, and information as he may require to perform his functions under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary shall establish, for each calendar year, commencing with January 1, 1979, a target reimbursement rate for home dialysis which shall be adjusted for regional variations <!-- PDFPage:2714 -->in the cost of providing home dialysis. In establishing such a rate, the Secretary shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary's estimate of the cost of providing medically necessary home dialysis supplies and equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an allowance, in an amount determined by the Secretary, to cover the cost of providing personnel to aid in home dialysis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an allowance, in an amount determined by the Secretary, to cover administrative costs and to provide an incentive for the efficient delivery of home dialysis;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but in no event (except as may be provided in regulations under paragraph (7)) shall such target rate exceed 75 percent of the national average payment, adjusted for regional variations, for maintenance dialysis services furnished in approved providers and facilities during the preceding fiscal year. Any such target rate so established shall be utilized, without renegotiation of the rate, throughout the calendar year for which it is established. During the last quarter of each calendar year, the Secretary shall establish a home dialysis target reimbursement rate for the next calendar year based on the most recent data available to the Secretary at the time. In establishing any rate under this paragraph, the Secretary may utilize a competitive-bid procedure, a prenegotiated rate procedure, or any other procedure (including methods established under paragraph (7)) which the Secretary determines is appropriate and feasible in order to carry out this paragraph in an effective and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Subject to paragraph (12), the Secretary shall provide by regulation for a method (or methods) for determining prospectively the amounts of payments to be made for dialysis services furnished by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities to individuals in a facility and to such individuals at home. Such method (or methods) shall provide for the prospective determination of a rate (or rates) for each mode of care based on a single composite weighted formula (which takes into account the mix of patients who receive dialysis services at a facility or at home and the relative costs of providing such services in such settings) for hospital-based facilities and such a single composite weighted formula for other renal dialysis facilities, or based on such other method or combination of methods which differentiate between hospital-based facilities and other renal dialysis facilities and which the Secretary determines, after detailed analysis, will more effectively encourage the more efficient delivery of dialysis services and will provide greater incentives for increased use of home dialysis than through the single composite weighted formulas. The amount of a payment made under any method other than a method based on a single composite weighted formula may not exceed the amount (or, in the case of continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis, 130 percent of the amount) of the median payment that would have been made under the formula for hospital-based facilities. Subject to section 422(a)(2) of the Medicare, Medicaid, and SCHIP Benefits Improvement and Protection Act of 2000, the Secretary shall provide for such exceptions to such methods as may be warranted by unusual circumstances (including the special circumstances of sole facilities located in isolated, rural areas and of pediatric facilities). Each application for such an exception shall be deemed to be approved unless the Secretary disapproves it by not later than 60 working days after the date the application is filed. The Secretary may provide that such method will serve in lieu of any target reimbursement rate that would otherwise be established under paragraph (6). The Secretary shall reduce the amount of each composite rate payment under this paragraph for each treatment by 50 cents (subject to such adjustments as may be required to reflect modes of dialysis other than hemodialysis) and provide for payment of such amount to the organizations (designated under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section) for such organizations&rsquo; necessary and proper administrative costs incurred in carrying out the responsibilities described in subsection (c)(2) of this section. The Secretary shall provide that amounts paid under the previous sentence shall be distributed to the organizations described in subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section to ensure equitable treatment of all such network organizations. The Secretary in distributing any such payments to network organizations shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the geographic size of the network area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the number of providers of end stage renal disease services in the network area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the number of individuals who are entitled to end stage renal disease services in the network area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the proportion of the aggregate administrative funds collected in the network area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall increase the amount of each composite rate payment for dialysis services furnished during 2000 by 1.2 percent above such composite rate payment amounts for such services furnished on December 31, 1999, for such services furnished on or after January 1, 2001, and before January 1, 2005, by 2.4 percent above such composite rate payment amounts for such services furnished on December 31, 2000, and for such services furnished on or after January 1, 2005, by 1.6 percent above such composite rate payment amounts for such services furnished on December 31, 2004.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;home dialysis supplies and equipment&rdquo; means medically necessary supplies and equipment (including supportive equipment) required by an individual suffering from end stage renal disease in connection with renal dialysis carried out in his home (as defined in regulations), including obtaining, installing, and maintaining such equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;self-care home dialysis support services&rdquo;, to the extent permitted in regulation, means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) periodic monitoring of the patient's home adaptation, including visits by qualified provider or facility personnel (as defined in regulations), so long as this is done in accordance with a plan prepared and periodically reviewed by a professional team (as defined in regulations) including the individual's physician;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) installation and maintenance of dialysis equipment;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2715 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) testing and appropriate treatment of the water; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such additional supportive services as the Secretary finds appropriate and desirable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(10) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;self-care dialysis unit&rdquo; means a renal dialysis facility or a distinct part of such facility or of a provider of services, which has been approved by the Secretary to make self-dialysis services, as defined by the Secretary in regulations, available to individuals who have been trained for self-dialysis. A self-care dialysis unit must, at a minimum, furnish the services, equipment and supplies needed for self-care dialysis, have patient-staff ratios which are appropriate to self-dialysis (allowing for such appropriate lesser degree of ongoing medical supervision and assistance of ancillary personnel than is required for full care maintenance dialysis), and meet such other requirements as the Secretary may prescribe with respect to the quality and cost-effectiveness of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11)(A) Hepatitis B vaccine and its administration, when provided to a patient determined to have end stage renal disease, shall not be included as dialysis services for purposes of payment under any prospective payment amount or comprehensive fee established under this section. Payment for such vaccine and its administration shall be made separately in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Erythropoietin, when provided to a patient determined to have end stage renal disease, shall not be included as a dialysis service for purposes of payment under any prospective payment amount or comprehensive fee established under this section, and subject to paragraphs (12) and (13) payment for such item shall be made separately&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of erythropoietin provided by a physician, in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em> of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of erythropoietin provided by a provider of services, renal dialysis facility, or other supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) for erythropoietin provided during 1994, in an amount equal to $10 per thousand units (rounded to the nearest 100 units), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) for erythropoietin provided during a subsequent year, in an amount determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, except that such amount may not exceed the amount determined under this clause for the previous year increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator for gross national product (as published by the Department of Commerce) for the second quarter of the preceding year over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the second preceding year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The amount payable to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician for erythropoietin shall be determined in the same manner as the amount payable to a renal dialysis facility for such item.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(12)(A) Subject to paragraph (14), in lieu of payment under paragraph (7) beginning with services furnished on January 1, 2005, the Secretary shall establish a basic case-mix adjusted prospective payment system for dialysis services furnished by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities in a year to individuals in a facility and to such individuals at home. The case-mix under such system shall be for a limited number of patient characteristics. Under such system, the payment rate for dialysis services furnished on or after January 1, 2009, by providers of services shall be the same as the payment rate (computed without regard to this sentence) for such services furnished by renal dialysis facilities, and in applying the geographic index under subparagraph (D) to providers of services, the labor share shall be based on the labor share otherwise applied for renal dialysis facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The system described in subparagraph (A) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the services comprising the composite rate established under paragraph (7); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the difference between payment amounts under this subchapter for separately billed drugs and biologicals (including erythropoietin) and acquisition costs of such drugs and biologicals, as determined by the Inspector General reports to the Secretary as required by section 623(c) of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) beginning with 2005, for such drugs and biologicals for which a billing code exists prior to January 1, 2004; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) beginning with 2007, for such drugs and biologicals for which a billing code does not exist prior to January 1, 2004,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">adjusted to 2005, or 2007, respectively, as determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In applying subparagraph (B)(ii) for 2005, such payment amounts under this subchapter shall be determined using the methodology specified in paragraph (13)(A)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For 2006, the Secretary shall provide for an adjustment to the payments under clause (i) to reflect the difference between the payment amounts using the methodology under paragraph (13)(A)(i) and the payment amount determined using the methodology applied by the Secretary under paragraph (13)(A)(iii) of such paragraph, as estimated by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall adjust the payment rates under such system by a geographic index as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. If the Secretary applies a geographic index under this paragraph that differs from the index applied under paragraph (7) the Secretary shall phase-in the application of the index under this paragraph over a multiyear period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) Such system shall be designed to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures for such services, as estimated by the Secretary, as would have been made for 2005 if this paragraph did not apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The adjustment made under subparagraph (B)(ii)(II) shall be done in a manner to result in the same aggregate amount of expenditures after such adjustment as would otherwise have been made for such services for 2006 or 2007, respectively, as estimated by the Secretary, if this paragraph did not apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Beginning with 2006, the Secretary shall annually increase the basic case-mix adjusted <!-- PDFPage:2716 -->payment amounts established under this paragraph, by an amount determined by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) applying the estimated growth in expenditures for drugs and biologicals (including erythropoietin) that are separately billable to the component of the basic case-mix adjusted system described in subparagraph (B)(ii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) converting the amount determined in clause (i) to an increase applicable to the basic case-mix adjusted payment amounts established under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except as provided in subparagraph (G), nothing in this paragraph or paragraph (14) shall be construed as providing for an update to the composite rate component of the basic case-mix adjusted system under subparagraph (B) or under the system under paragraph (14).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) furnished on or after January 1, 2006, and before April 1, 2007, by 1.6 percent above the amount of such composite rate component for such services furnished on December 31, 2005;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) furnished on or after April 1, 2007, and before January 1, 2009, by 1.6 percent above the amount of such composite rate component for such services furnished on March 31, 2007;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) furnished on or after January 1, 2009, and before January 1, 2010, by 1.0 percent above the amount of such composite rate component for such services furnished on December 31, 2008; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) furnished on or after January 1, 2010, by 1.0 percent above the amount of such composite rate component for such services furnished on December 31, 2009.</p>
