<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) identify opportunities to accelerate the commercial applications of new energy technologies, and provide Federal assistance for or participation in demonstration projects (including pilot plants demonstrating technological advances and field demonstrations of new methods and procedures, and demonstrations of prototype commercial applications for the exploration, development, production, transportation, conversion, and utilization of energy resources); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) enter into cooperative agreements with non-Federal entities to demonstrate the technical feasibility and economic potential of energy technologies on a prototype or full-scale basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criteria applicable in reviewing potential projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In reviewing potential projects, the Secretary shall consider criteria including but not limited to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the economic, environmental, and societal significance which a successful demonstration may have for the national fuels and energy system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the relationship of the proposal to the criteria of priority set forth in section 5904(b)(2) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the availability of non-Federal participants to construct and operate the facilities or perform the activities associated with the proposal and to contribute to the financing of the proposal;</p>

Such regulations shall establish a procedure for selection of proposals which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provides that projects will be carried out under such conditions and varying circumstances as will assist in solving energy extraction, transportation, conversion, conservation, and end-use problems of various areas and regions, under representative geological, geographic, and environmental conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provides time schedules for submission of, and action on, proposal requests for the purposes of implementing the goals and objectives of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such regulations also shall specify the types and form of the information, data, and support documentation that are to be contained in proposals for each form of Federal assistance or participation set forth in section 5906(a) of this title: <em>Provided</em>, That such proposals to the extent possible shall include, but not be limited to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) description of prior pilot plant operating experience with the technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) preliminary design of the demonstration plant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) time tables containing proposed construction and operation plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) budget-type estimates of construction and operating costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) description and proof of title to land for proposed site, natural resources, electricity and water supply and logistical information related to access to raw materials to construct and operate the plant and to dispose of salable products produced from the plant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) analysis of the environmental impact of the proposed plant and plans for disposal of wastes resulting from the operation of the plant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) plans for commercial use of the technology if the demonstration is successful;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) plans for continued use of the plant if the demonstration is successful; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) plans for dismantling of the plant if the demonstration is unsuccessful or otherwise abandoned.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of estimate of Federal investment requiring Congressional authorization for appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the estimate of the Federal investment with respect to construction costs of any demonstration project proposed to be established under this section exceeds $50,000,000, no amount may be appropriated for such project except as specifically authorized by legislation hereafter enacted by the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Amount of estimated Federal contribution authorizing Secretary to proceed with negotiation of agreements and implementation of proposal; amount of Federal contribution requiring Secretary to submit report to Congress as prerequisite to expenditure of funds</h4>
