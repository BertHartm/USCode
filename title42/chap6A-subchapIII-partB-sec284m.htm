<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) List of priority issues in pediatric therapeutics</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than one year after September 27, 2007, the Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health and in consultation with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs and experts in pediatric research, shall develop and publish a priority list of needs in pediatric therapeutics, including drugs or indications that require study. The list shall be revised every three years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration of available information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In developing and prioritizing the list under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) therapeutic gaps in pediatrics that may include developmental pharmacology, pharmacogenetic determinants of drug response, metabolism of drugs and biologics in children, and pediatric clinical trials;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) particular pediatric diseases, disorders or conditions where more complete knowledge and testing of therapeutics, including drugs and biologics, may be beneficial in pediatric populations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the adequacy of necessary infrastructure to conduct pediatric pharmacological research, including research networks and trained pediatric investigators.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Pediatric studies and research</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, acting through the National Institutes of Health, shall award funds to entities that have the expertise to conduct pediatric clinical trials or other research (including qualified universities, hospitals, laboratories, contract research organizations, practice groups, federally funded programs such as pediatric pharmacology research units, other public or private institutions, or individuals) to enable the entities to conduct the drug studies or other research on the issues described in subsection (a). The Secretary may use contracts, grants, or other appropriate funding mechanisms to award funds under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Process for proposed pediatric study requests and labeling changes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Submission of proposed pediatric study request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director of the National Institutes of Health shall, as appropriate, submit proposed pediatric study requests for consideration by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs for pediatric studies of a specific pediatric indication identified under subsection (a). Such a proposed pediatric study request shall be made in a manner equivalent to a written request made under subsection (b) or (c) of section 505A of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355a], including with respect to the information provided on the pediatric studies to be conducted pursuant to the request. The Director of the National Institutes of Health may submit a proposed pediatric study request for a drug for which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) there is an approved application under section 505(j) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355(j)]; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) there is a submitted application that could be approved under the criteria of such section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there is no patent protection or market exclusivity protection for at least one form of the drug under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) additional studies are needed to assess the safety and effectiveness of the use of the drug in the pediatric population.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Written request to holders of approved applications for drugs lacking exclusivity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in consultation with the Director of the National Institutes of Health, may issue a written request based on the proposed pediatric study request for the indication or indications submitted pursuant to paragraph (1) (which shall include a timeframe for negotiations for an agreement) for pediatric studies concerning a drug identified under subsection (a) to all holders of an approved application for the drug under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355]. Such a written request shall be made in a manner equivalent to the manner in which a written request is made under subsection (b) or (c) of section 505A of such Act [21 U.S.C. 355a], including with respect to information provided on the pediatric studies to be conducted pursuant to the request and using appropriate formulations for each age group for which the study is requested.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Requests for proposals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Commissioner of Food and Drugs does not receive a response to a written request issued under paragraph (2) not later than 30 days after the date on which a request was issued, the Secretary, acting through the Director of the National Institutes of Health and in consultation with the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall publish a request for proposals to conduct the pediatric studies described in the written request in accordance with subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Disqualification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A holder that receives a first right of refusal shall not be entitled to respond to a request for proposals under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Contracts, grants, or other funding mechanisms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A contract, grant, or other funding may be awarded under this section only if a proposal is submitted to the Secretary in such form and manner, and containing such agreements, assurances, and information as the Secretary determines to be necessary to carry out this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Reporting of studies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">On completion of a pediatric study in accordance with an award under this section, a report concerning the study shall be submitted to the Director of the National Insti<!-- PDFPage:475 -->tutes of Health and the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. The report shall include all data generated in connection with the study, including a written request if issued.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Availability of reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each report submitted under subparagraph (A) shall be considered to be in the public domain (subject to section 505A(d)(4) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 355a(d)(4)]) and shall be assigned a docket number by the Commissioner of Food and Drugs. An interested person may submit written comments concerning such pediatric studies to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, and the written comments shall become part of the docket file with respect to each of the drugs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Action by Commissioner</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall take appropriate action in response to the reports submitted under subparagraph (A) in accordance with paragraph (7).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) No effect on authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection limits the authority of the United States to bring an enforcement action under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] when a drug lacks appropriate pediatric labeling. Neither course of action (the Pediatric Advisory Committee process or an enforcement action referred to in the preceding sentence) shall preclude, delay, or serve as the basis to stay the other course of action.</p>
