<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Demand responsive system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, discrimination includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a failure of a private entity which operates a demand responsive system and which is not subject to section 12184 of this title to operate such system so that, when viewed in its entirety, such system ensures a level of service to individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, equivalent to the level of service provided to individuals without disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the purchase or lease by such entity for use on such system of a vehicle with a seating capacity in excess of 16 passengers (including the driver), for which solicitations are made after the 30th day following the effective date of this subparagraph, that is not readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities (including individuals who use wheelchairs) unless such entity can demonstrate that such system, when viewed in its entirety, provides a level of service to individuals with disabilities equivalent to that provided to individuals without disabilities.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Specific construction</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Historical or antiquated cars</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent that compliance with subsection (b)(2)(C) or (b)(7) of this section would significantly alter the historic or antiquated character of a historical or antiquated rail passenger car, or a rail station served exclusively by such cars, or would result in violation of any rule, regulation, standard, or order issued by the Secretary of Transportation under the Federal Railroad Safety Act of 1970, such compliance shall not be required.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;12185. Study</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Office of Technology Assessment shall undertake a study to determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the access needs of individuals with disabilities to over-the-road buses and over-the-road bus service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the most cost-effective methods for providing access to over-the-road buses and over-<!-- PDFPage:5753 -->the-road bus service to individuals with disabilities, particularly individuals who use wheelchairs, through all forms of boarding options.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The study shall include, at a minimum, an analysis of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The anticipated demand by individuals with disabilities for accessible over-the-road buses and over-the-road bus service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The degree to which such buses and service, including any service required under sections 12184(b)(4) and 12186(a)(2) of this title, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The effectiveness of various methods of providing accessibility to such buses and service to individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The cost of providing accessible over-the-road buses and bus service to individuals with disabilities, including consideration of recent technological and cost saving developments in equipment and devices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Possible design changes in over-the-road buses that could enhance accessibility, including the installation of accessible restrooms which do not result in a loss of seating capacity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The impact of accessibility requirements on the continuation of over-the-road bus service, with particular consideration of the impact of such requirements on such service to rural communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Advisory committee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In conducting the study required by subsection (a) of this section, the Office of Technology Assessment shall establish an advisory committee, which shall consist of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) members selected from among private operators and manufacturers of over-the-road buses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) members selected from among individuals with disabilities, particularly individuals who use wheelchairs, who are potential riders of such buses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) members selected for their technical expertise on issues included in the study, including manufacturers of boarding assistance equipment and devices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The number of members selected under each of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be equal, and the total number of members selected under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall exceed the number of members selected under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deadline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The study required by subsection (a) of this section, along with recommendations by the Office of Technology Assessment, including any policy options for legislative action, shall be submitted to the President and Congress within 36 months after July 26, 1990. If the President determines that compliance with the regulations issued pursuant to section 12186(a)(2)(B) of this title on or before the applicable deadlines specified in section 12186(a)(2)(B) of this title will result in a significant reduction in intercity over-the-road bus service, the President shall extend each such deadline by 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing the study required by subsection (a) of this section, the Office of Technology Assessment shall provide a preliminary draft of such study to the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board established under section 792 of title 29. The Board shall have an opportunity to comment on such draft study, and any such comments by the Board made in writing within 120 days after the Board's receipt of the draft study shall be incorporated as part of the final study required to be submitted under subsection (d) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any person or group of persons has been discriminated against under this subchapter and such discrimination raises an issue of general public importance,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may grant any equitable relief that such court considers to be appropriate, including, to the extent required by this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) granting temporary, preliminary, or permanent relief;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) providing an auxiliary aid or service, modification of policy, practice, or procedure, or alternative method; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may award such other relief as the court considers to be appropriate, including monetary damages to persons aggrieved when requested by the Attorney General; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not exceeding $100,000 for any subsequent violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Single violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2)(C), in determining whether a first or subsequent violation has occurred, a determination in a single action, by judgment or settlement, that the covered entity has engaged in more than one discriminatory act shall be counted as a single violation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section, the term &ldquo;monetary damages&rdquo; and <!-- PDFPage:5756 -->&ldquo;such other relief&rdquo; does not include punitive damages.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Judicial consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a civil action under paragraph (1)(B), the court, when considering what amount of civil penalty, if any, is appropriate, shall give consideration to any good faith effort or attempt to comply with this chapter by the entity. In evaluating good faith, the court shall consider, among other factors it deems relevant, whether the entity could have reasonably anticipated the need for an appropriate type of auxiliary aid needed to accommodate the unique needs of a particular individual with a disability.</p>
