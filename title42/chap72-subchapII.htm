<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Programs selected for assistance through grants or contracts under this part (other than section 5651(f) of this title) shall be reviewed before selection, and thereafter as appropriate, through a formal peer review process utilizing experts (other than officers and employees of the Department of Justice) in fields related to the subject matter of the proposed program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such process shall be established by the Administrator in consultation with the Directors and other appropriate officials of the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health. Before implementation of such process, the Administrator shall submit such process to such Directors, each of whom shall prepare and furnish to the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a final report containing their comments on such process as proposed to be established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator, in establishing the processes required under paragraphs (1) and (2), shall provide for emergency expedited consideration of the proposed programs if necessary to avoid any delay which would preclude carrying out such programs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;case review system&rdquo; means a procedure for ensuring that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each youth has a case plan, based on the use of objective criteria for determining a youth's danger to the community or himself or herself, that is designed to achieve appropriate placement in the least restrictive and most family-like setting available in close proximity to the parents&rsquo; home, consistent with the best interests and special needs of the youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the status of each youth is reviewed periodically but not less frequently than once every 3 months, by a court or by administrative review, in order to determine the continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with respect to each youth, procedural safeguards will be applied to ensure that a dispositional hearing is held to consider the future status of each youth under State supervision, in a juvenile or family court or another court (including a tribal court) of competent jurisdiction, or by an administrative body appointed or approved by the court, not later than 12 months after the original placement of the youth and periodically thereafter during the continuation of out-of-home placement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a youth's health, mental health, and education record is reviewed and updated periodically; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;challenge activity&rdquo; means a program maintained for 1 of the following purposes:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Developing and adopting policies and programs to provide access to counsel for all juveniles in the justice system to ensure that juveniles consult with counsel before waiving the right to counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Increasing community-based alternatives to incarceration by establishing programs (such as expanded use of probation, mediation, restitution, community service, treatment, home detention, intensive supervision, and electronic monitoring) and developing and adopting a set of objective criteria for the appropriate placement of juveniles in detention and secure confinement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Developing and adopting policies and programs to provide secure settings for the placement of violent juvenile offenders by closing down traditional training schools and replacing them with secure settings with capacities of no more than 50 violent juvenile offenders with ratios of staff to youth great enough to ensure adequate supervision and treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Developing and adopting policies to prohibit gender bias in placement and treatment and establishing programs to ensure that female youth have access to the full range of health and mental health services, treatment for physical or sexual assault and abuse, self defense instruction, education in parenting, education in general, and other training and vocational services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Establishing and operating, either directly or by contract or arrangement with a public agency or other appropriate private nonprofit organization (other than an agency or organization that is responsible for licensing or certifying out-of-home care services for youth), a State ombudsman office for children, youth, and families to investigate and resolve complaints relating to action, inaction, or decisions of providers of out-of-home care to children and youth (including secure detention and correctional facilities, residential care facilities, public agencies, and social service agencies) that may adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, or rights of resident children and youth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Developing and adopting policies and programs designed to remove, where appropriate, status offenders from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to prevent the placement in secure detention facilities or secure correctional facilities of juveniles who are nonoffenders or who are charged with or who have committed offenses that would not be criminal if committed by an adult.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Developing and adopting policies and programs designed to serve as alternatives to suspension and expulsion from school.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4276 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Increasing aftercare services for juveniles involved in the justice system by establishing programs and developing and adopting policies to provide comprehensive health, mental health, education, and vocational services and services that preserve and strengthen the families of such juveniles.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a State administrative structure to coordinate program and fiscal policies for children who have emotional and behavioral problems and their families among the major child serving systems, including schools, social services, health services, mental health services, and the juvenile justice system; and</p>
