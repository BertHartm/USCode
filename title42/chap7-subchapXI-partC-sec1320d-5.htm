Such assistance shall be provided in any manner determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a failure to comply which is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, any penalty under subsection (a) and any damages under subsection (d) that is&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1320d-5_2_target" name="1320d-5_2">2</a></sup> not entirely waived under paragraph (3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1320d-5_3_target" name="1320d-5_3">3</a></sup> may be waived to the extent that the payment of such penalty&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1320d-5_4_target" name="1320d-5_4">4</a></sup> would be excessive relative to the compliance failure involved.</p>
