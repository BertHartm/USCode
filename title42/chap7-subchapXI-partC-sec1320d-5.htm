<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary shall impose on any person who violates a provision of this part a penalty of not more than $100 for each such <!-- PDFPage:1857 -->violation, except that the total amount imposed on the person for all violations of an identical requirement or prohibition during a calendar year may not exceed $25,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b) and the second sentence of subsection (f)) shall apply to the imposition of a civil money penalty under this subsection in the same manner as such provisions apply to the imposition of a penalty under such section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Offenses otherwise punishable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A penalty may not be imposed under subsection (a) of this section with respect to an act if the act constitutes an offense punishable under section 1320d&ndash;6 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noncompliance not discovered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A penalty may not be imposed under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a provision of this part if it is established to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the person liable for the penalty did not know, and by exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, that such person violated the provision.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Failures due to reasonable cause</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a penalty may not be imposed under subsection (a) of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the failure to comply was due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the failure to comply is corrected during the 30-day period beginning on the first date the person liable for the penalty knew, or by exercising reasonable diligence would have known, that the failure to comply occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extension of period</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) No penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The period referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii) may be extended as determined appropriate by the Secretary based on the nature and extent of the failure to comply.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the Secretary determines that a person failed to comply because the person was unable to comply, the Secretary may provide technical assistance to the person during the period described in subparagraph (A)(ii). Such assistance shall be provided in any manner determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a failure to comply which is due to reasonable cause and not to willful neglect, any penalty under subsection (a) of this section that is not entirely waived under paragraph (3) may be waived to the extent that the payment of such penalty would be excessive relative to the compliance failure involved.</p>
