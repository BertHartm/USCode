<p class="statutory-body">The President may, by rule, under such terms and conditions as he determines to be appropriate and necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter, restrict exports of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) coal, petroleum products, natural gas, or petrochemical feedstocks, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) supplies of materials or equipment which he determines to be necessary (A) to maintain or further exploration, production, refining, or transportation of energy supplies, or (B) for the construction or maintenance of energy facilities within the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President shall exercise the authority provided for in subsection (a) of this section to promulgate a rule prohibiting the export of crude oil and natural gas produced in the United States, except that the President may, pursuant to paragraph (2), exempt from such prohibition such crude oil or natural gas exports which he determines to be consistent with the national interest and the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Exemptions from any rule prohibiting crude oil or natural gas exports shall be included in such rule or provided for in an amendment thereto and may be based on the purpose for export, class of seller or purchaser, country of destination, or any other reasonable classification or basis as the President determines to be appropriate and consistent with the national interest and the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementing restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to implement any rule promulgated under subsection (a) of this section, the President may request and, if so, the Secretary of Commerce shall, pursuant to the procedures established by the Export Administration Act of 1979 [50 U.S.C. App. 2401 et seq.] (but without regard to the phrase &ldquo;and to reduce the serious inflationary impact of foreign demand&rdquo; in section 3(2)(C) of such Act [50 U.S.C. App. 2402(2)(C)]), impose such restrictions as specified in any rule under subsection (a) of this section on exports of coal, petroleum products, natural gas, or petrochemical feedstocks, and such supplies of materials and equipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Restrictions and national interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any finding by the President pursuant to subsection (a) or (b) of this section and any action taken by the Secretary of Commerce pursuant thereto shall take into account the national interest as related to the need to leave uninterrupted or unimpaired&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) temporary exports for convenience or increased efficiency of transportation across parts of an adjacent foreign state which exports reenter the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the historical trading relations of the United States with Canada and Mexico.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of notice and comment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 shall apply with respect to the promulgation of any rule pursuant to this section, except that the President may waive the requirement pertaining to the notice of proposed rulemaking or period for comment only if he finds that compliance with such requirements may seriously impair his ability to impose effective and timely prohibitions on exports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event such notice and comment period are waived with respect to a rule promulgated under this section, the President shall afford interested persons an opportunity to comment on any such rule at the earliest practicable date thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the President determines to request the Secretary of Commerce to impose specified restrictions as provided for in subsection (c) of this section, the enforcement and penalty provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1969 shall apply, in lieu of this chapter, to any violation of such restrictions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such lands have extremely high cost exploration or development problems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) exploration and development will not occur on such lands unless such exemption is granted.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Findings of the Secretary under this subsection shall be final, and shall not be invalidated unless found to be arbitrary or capricious.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unitization of producing fields</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not be construed to prohibit the unitization of producing fields to increase production or maximize ultimate recovery of oil or natural gas, or both.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of contracts entered into under this part, and amendments to such contracts, for which implementing legislation will be needed, the Secretary may transmit an implementing bill to both Houses of the Congress.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules of Senate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsections (e) through (h) of this section are enacted by the Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of the Senate but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in the Senate in the case of implementing bills and implementing revenue bills described in subsection (a) of this section, and they supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the Senate to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of the Senate) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Discharge in Senate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the committee or committees of the Senate to which an implementing bill has been referred have not reported it at the close of the 30th day after its introduction, such committee or committees shall be automatically discharged from further consideration of the bill, and it shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a dislocation in the heating oil market has resulted from such interruption; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a circumstance, other than that described in paragraph (1), exists that constitutes a regional supply shortage of significant scope and duration and that action taken under this section would assist directly and significantly in reducing the adverse impact of such shortage.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section a &ldquo;dislocation in the heating oil market&rdquo; shall be deemed to occur only when&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The price differential between crude oil, as reflected in an industry daily publication such as &ldquo;Platt's Oilgram Price Report&rdquo; or &ldquo;Oil Daily&rdquo; and No. 2 heating oil, as reported in the Energy Information Administration's retail price data for the Northeast, increases by more than 60 percent over its 5-year rolling average for the months of mid-October through March (considered as a heating season average), and continues for 7 consecutive days; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Release of petroleum distillate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After consultation with the heating oil industry, the Secretary shall determine procedures governing the release of petroleum distillate from the Reserve. The procedures shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sell petroleum distillate from the Reserve through a competitive process, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enter into exchange agreements for the petroleum distillate that results&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6250b_1_target" name="6250b_1">1</a></sup> in the Secretary receiving a greater volume of petroleum distillate as repayment than the volume provided to the acquirer;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in all such sales or exchanges, the Secretary shall receive revenue or its equivalent in petroleum distillate that provides the Department with fair market value. At no time may the oil be sold or exchanged resulting in <!-- PDFPage:5126 -->a loss of revenue or value to the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary shall only sell or dispose of the oil in the Reserve to entities customarily engaged in the sale and distribution of petroleum distillate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Plan</h4>
