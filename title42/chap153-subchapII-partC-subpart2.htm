<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a study identifying a mechanism to compare rates of recidivism (including rearrest, violations of parole, probation, post-incarceration supervision, and reincarceration) among States; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a national recidivism study every 3 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a study of parole, probation, or post-incarceration supervision violations and revocations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a study concerning the most appropriate measure to be used when reporting recidivism rates (whether rearrest, reincarceration, or any other valid, evidence-based measure).</p>
