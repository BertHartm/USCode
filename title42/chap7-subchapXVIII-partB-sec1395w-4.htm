<p class="statutory-body-1em">Effective for all physicians&rsquo; services (as defined in subsection (j)(3) of this section) furnished under this part during a year (beginning with 1992) for which payment is otherwise made on the basis of a reasonable charge or on the basis of a fee schedule under section 1395m(b) of this title, payment under this part shall instead be based on the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the actual charge for the service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the amount determined under the fee schedule established under subsection (b) of this section for services furnished during that year (in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;fee schedule amount&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transition to full fee schedule</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limiting reductions and increases to 15 percent in 1992</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Limit on increase</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limit in reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a service in a fee schedule area for which the adjusted historical payment basis exceeds 115 percent of the fee schedule amount for services furnished in 1992, there shall be substituted for the fee schedule amount an amount equal to the adjusted historical payment basis minus 15 percent of the fee schedule amount otherwise established (without regard to this paragraph).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for 1993, 1994, and 1995</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a physicians&rsquo; service in a fee schedule area is subject to the provisions of subparagraph (A) in 1992, for physicians&rsquo; services furnished in the area&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;adjusted historical payment basis&rdquo; means, with respect to a physicians&rsquo; service furnished in a fee schedule area, the weighted average prevailing charge applied in the area for the service in 1991 (as determined by the Secretary without regard to physician specialty and as adjusted to reflect payments for services with customary charges below the prevailing charge or other payment limitations imposed by law or regulation) adjusted by the update established under subsection (d)(3) of this section for 1992.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Application to radiology services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In applying clause (i) in the case of physicians&rsquo; services which are radiology serv<!-- PDFPage:1914 -->ices (including radiologist services, as defined in section 1395m(b)(6) of this title), but excluding nuclear medicine services that are subject to section 6105(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, there shall be substituted for the weighted average prevailing charge the amount provided under the fee schedule established for the service for the fee schedule area under section 1395m(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying paragraph (1)(B) in the case of a nonparticipating physician or a nonparticipating supplier or other person, the fee schedule amount shall be 95 percent of such amount otherwise applied under this subsection (without regard to this paragraph). In the case of physicians&rsquo; services (including services which the Secretary excludes pursuant to subsection (j)(3) of this section) of a nonparticipating physician, supplier, or other person for which payment is made under this part on a basis other than the fee schedule amount, the payment shall be based on 95 percent of the payment basis for such services furnished by a participating physician, supplier, or other person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for medical direction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to physicians&rsquo; services furnished on or after January 1, 1994, and consisting of medical direction of two, three, or four concurrent anesthesia cases, the fee schedule amount to be applied shall be equal to one-half of the amount described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount described in this subparagraph, for a physician's medical direction of the performance of anesthesia services, is the following percentage of the fee schedule amount otherwise applicable under this section if the anesthesia services were personally performed by the physician alone:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) For services furnished during 1994, 120 percent.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before November 1 of the preceding year, for each year beginning with 1998, the Secretary shall establish, by regulation, fee schedules that establish payment amounts for all physicians&rsquo; services furnished in all fee schedule areas (as defined in subsection (j)(2) of this section) for the year. Except as provided in paragraph (2), each such payment amount for a service shall be equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the relative value for the service (as determined in subsection (c)(2) of this section),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the conversion factor (established under subsection (d) of this section) for the year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the geographic adjustment factor (established under subsection (e)(2) of this section) for the service for the fee schedule area.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Radiology services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to radiology services (including radiologist services, as defined in section 1395m(b)(6) of this title), the Secretary shall base the relative values on the relative value scale developed under section 1395m(b)(1)(A) of this title, with appropriate modifications of the relative values to assure that the relative values established for radiology services which are similar or related to other physicians&rsquo; services are consistent with the relative values established for those similar or related services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Anesthesia services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the fee schedule for anesthesia services for which a relative value guide has been established under section 4048(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, the Secretary shall use, to the extent practicable, such relative value guide, with appropriate adjustment of the conversion factor, in a manner to assure that the fee schedule amounts for anesthesia services are consistent with the fee schedule amounts for other services determined by the Secretary to be of comparable value. In applying the previous sentence, the Secretary shall adjust the conversion factor by geographic adjustment factors in the same manner as such adjustment is made under paragraph (1)(C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall consult with the Physician Payment Review Commission and organizations representing physicians or suppliers who furnish radiology services and anesthesia services in applying subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of interpretation of electrocardiograms</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall make separate payment under this section for the interpretation of electrocardiograms performed or ordered to be performed as part of or in conjunction with a visit to or a consultation with a physician, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall adjust the relative values established for visits and consultations under sub<!-- PDFPage:1915 -->section (c) of this section so as not to include relative value units for interpretations of electrocardiograms in the relative value for visits and consultations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of relative values for physicians&rsquo; services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Division of physicians&rsquo; services into components</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;work component&rdquo; means the portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects physician time and intensity in furnishing the service. Such portion shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) include activities before and after direct patient contact, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) be defined, with respect to surgical procedures, to reflect a global definition including pre-operative and post-operative physicians&rsquo; services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Practice expense component&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;practice expense component&rdquo; means the portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects the general categories of expenses (such as office rent and wages of personnel, but excluding malpractice expenses) comprising practice expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) &ldquo;Malpractice component&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;malpractice component&rdquo; means the portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects malpractice expenses in furnishing the service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of relative values</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Combination of units for components</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall develop a methodology for combining the work, practice expense, and malpractice relative value units, determined under subparagraph (C), for each service in a manner to produce a single relative value for that service. Such relative values are subject to adjustment under subparagraph (F)(i) and section 13515(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Extrapolation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may use extrapolation and other techniques to determine the number of relative value units for physicians&rsquo; services for which specific data are not available and shall take into account recommendations of the Physician Payment Review Commission and the results of consultations with organizations representing physicians who provide such services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Periodic review and adjustments in relative values</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary, not less often than every 5 years, shall review the relative values established under this paragraph for all physicians&rsquo; services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">The adjustments under subclause (I) for a year may not cause the amount of expenditures under this part for the year to differ by more than $20,000,000 from the amount of expenditures under this part that would have been made if such adjustments had not been made.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary, in making adjustments under clause (ii), shall consult with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and organizations representing physicians.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Computation of relative value units for components</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this section for each physicians&rsquo; service&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Work relative value units</h4>

For 1999, such number of units shall be determined based 75 percent on such product and based 25 percent on the relative practice expense resources involved in furnishing the service. For 2000, such number of units shall be determined based 50 percent on such product and based 50 percent on such relative practice expense resources. For 2001, such number of units shall be determined based 25 percent on such product and based 75 percent on such relative practice expense resources. For a subsequent year, such number of units shall be determined based entirely on such relative practice expense resources.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Malpractice relative value units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall determine a number of malpractice relative value units for the <!-- PDFPage:1916 -->service for years before 2000 equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the base allowed charges (as defined in subparagraph (D)) for the service, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the malpractice percentage for the service (as determined under paragraph (3)(C)(iii)),</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;base allowed charges&rdquo; means, with respect to a physician's service, the national average allowed charges for the service under this part for services furnished during 1991, as estimated by the Secretary using the most recent data available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Reduction in practice expense relative value units for certain services</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary shall reduce the practice expense relative value units applied to services described in clause (iii) furnished in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 1994, by 25 percent of the number by which the number of practice expense relative value units (determined for 1994 without regard to this subparagraph) exceeds the number of work relative value units determined for 1994,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 1995, by an additional 25 percent of such excess, and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Excluded services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (iii), the services described in this clause are services which the Secretary determines at least 75 percent of which are provided under this subchapter in an office setting.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Budget neutrality adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall reduce the relative values for all services (other than anesthesia services) established under this paragraph (and, in the case of anesthesia services, the conversion factor established by the Secretary for such services) by such percentage as the Secretary determines to be necessary so that, beginning in 1996, the amendment made by section 13514(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 would not result in expenditures under this section that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made if such amendment had not been made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall reduce the amounts determined under subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this section by such percentage as the Secretary determines to be required to assure that, taking into account the reductions made under clause (i), the amendment made by section 13514(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 would not result in expenditures under this section in 1994 that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made if such amendment had not been made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Adjustments in relative value units for 1998</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) subject to clauses (iv) and (v), reduce the practice expense relative value units applied to any services described in clause (ii) furnished in 1998 to a number equal to 110 percent of the number of work relative value units, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) increase the practice expense relative value units for office visit procedure codes during 1998 by a uniform percentage which the Secretary estimates will result in an aggregate increase in payments for such services equal to the aggregate decrease in payments by reason of subclause (I).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Services covered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the services described in this clause are physicians&rsquo; services that are not described in clause (iii) and for which&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(v) No reduction for certain services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Practice expense relative value units for a procedure performed in an office or in a <!-- PDFPage:1917 -->setting out of an office shall not be reduced under clause (i) if the in-office or out-of-office practice expense relative value, respectively, for the procedure would increase under the proposed rule on resource-based practice expenses issued by the Secretary on June 18, 1997 (62 Federal Register 33158 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Component percentages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine a work percentage, a practice expense percentage, and a malpractice percentage for each physician's service as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Division of services by specialty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each physician's service or class of physicians&rsquo; services, the Secretary shall determine the average percentage of each such service or class of services that is performed, nationwide, under this part by physicians in each of the different physician specialties (as identified by the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Division of specialty by component</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall determine the average percentage division of resources, among the work component, the practice expense component, and the malpractice component, used by physicians in each of such specialties in furnishing physicians&rsquo; services. Such percentages shall be based on national data that describe the elements of physician practice costs and revenues, by physician specialty. The Secretary may use extrapolation and other techniques to determine practice costs and revenues for specialties for which adequate data are not available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Determination of component percentages</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Work percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The work percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the average percentage division for the work component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Practice expense percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For years before 2002, the practice expense percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the average percentage division for the practice expense component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Malpractice percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For years before 1999, the malpractice percentage for a service (or class of services) is equal to the sum (for all physician specialties) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the average percentage division for the malpractice component for each physician specialty (determined under subparagraph (B)), multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the proportion (determined under subparagraph (A)) of such service (or services) performed by physicians in that specialty.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Periodic recomputation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may, from time to time, provide for the recomputation of work percentages, practice expense percentages, and malpractice percentages determined under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Ancillary policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may establish ancillary policies (with respect to the use of modifiers, local codes, and other matters) as may be necessary to implement this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Coding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a uniform procedure coding system for the coding of all physicians&rsquo; services. The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate coding structure for visits and consultations. The Secretary may incorporate the use of time in the coding for visits and consultations. The Secretary, in establishing such coding system, shall consult with the Physician Payment Review Commission and other organizations representing physicians.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) No variation for specialists</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not vary the conversion factor or the number of relative value units for a physicians&rsquo; service based on whether the physician furnishing the service is a specialist or based on the type of specialty of the physician.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conversion factors</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The conversion factor for each year shall be the conversion factor established under this subsection for the previous year (or, in the case of 1992, specified in subparagraph (B)) adjusted by the update (established under paragraph (3)) for the year involved.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special provision for 1992</h4>
