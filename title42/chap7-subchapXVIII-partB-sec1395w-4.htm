<p class="statutory-body-1em">Effective for all physicians&rsquo; services (as defined in subsection (j)(3) of this section) furnished under this part during a year (beginning with 1992) for which payment is otherwise made on the basis of a reasonable charge or on the basis of a fee schedule under section 1395m(b) of this title, payment under this part shall instead be based on the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the actual charge for the service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the amount determined under the fee schedule established under subsection (b) of this section for services furnished during that year (in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;fee schedule amount&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transition to full fee schedule</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limiting reductions and increases to 15 percent in 1992</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Limit on increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a service in a fee schedule area (as defined in subsection (j)(2) of this section) for which the adjusted historical payment basis (as defined in subparagraph (D)) is less than 85 percent of the fee schedule amount for services furnished in 1992, there shall be substituted for the fee schedule amount an amount equal to the adjusted historical payment basis plus 15 percent of the fee schedule amount otherwise established (without regard to this paragraph).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limit in reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a service in a fee schedule area for which the adjusted historical pay<!-- PDFPage:2287 -->ment basis exceeds 115 percent of the fee schedule amount for services furnished in 1992, there shall be substituted for the fee schedule amount an amount equal to the adjusted historical payment basis minus 15 percent of the fee schedule amount otherwise established (without regard to this paragraph).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for 1993, 1994, and 1995</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a physicians&rsquo; service in a fee schedule area is subject to the provisions of subparagraph (A) in 1992, for physicians&rsquo; services furnished in the area&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 75 percent of the fee schedule amount determined under subparagraph (A), adjusted by the update established under subsection (d)(3) of this section for 1993, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount described in this subparagraph, for a physician's medical direction of the performance of anesthesia services, is the following percentage of the fee schedule amount otherwise applicable under this section if the anesthesia services were personally performed by the physician alone:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before November 1 of the preceding year, for each year beginning with 1998, the Secretary shall establish, by regulation, fee schedules that establish payment amounts for all physicians&rsquo; services furnished in all fee schedule areas (as defined in subsection (j)(2) of this section) for the year. Except as provided in paragraph (2), each such payment amount for a service shall be equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the relative value for the service (as determined in subsection (c)(2) of this section),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the conversion factor (established under subsection (d) of this section) for the year, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Radiology services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to radiology services (including radiologist services, as defined in section 1395m(b)(6) of this title), the Secretary shall base the relative values on the relative value scale developed under section 1395m(b)(1)(A) of this title, with appropriate modifications of the relative values to assure that the relative values established for radiology services which are similar or related to other physicians&rsquo; services are consistent with the relative values established for those similar or related services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Anesthesia services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the fee schedule for anesthesia services for which a relative value guide has been established under section 4048(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, the Secretary shall use, to the extent practicable, such relative value guide, with appropriate adjustment of the conversion factor, in a manner to assure that the fee schedule amounts for anesthesia services are consistent with the fee schedule amounts for other services determined by the Secretary to be of comparable value. In applying the previous sentence, the Secretary shall adjust the conversion factor by geographic adjustment factors in the same manner as such adjustment is made under paragraph (1)(C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall consult with the Physician Payment Review Commission and organizations representing physicians or suppliers who furnish radiology services and anesthesia services in applying subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall adjust the relative values established for visits and consultations under subsection (c) of this section so as not to include relative value units for interpretations of electrocardiograms in the relative value for visits and consultations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for imaging services</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of imaging services described in subparagraph (B) furnished on or after January 1, 2007, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the technical component (including the technical component portion of a global fee) of the service established for a year under the fee schedule described in paragraph (1) without application of the geographic adjustment factor described in paragraph (1)(C), exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under the prospective payment system for hospital outpatient department services under paragraph (3)(D) of section 1395<em>l</em>(t) of this title for such service for such year, determined without regard to geographic adjustment under paragraph (2)(D) of such section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall develop a methodology for combining the work, practice expense, and malpractice relative value units, determined under subparagraph (C), for each service in a manner to produce a single relative value for that service. Such relative values are subject to adjustment under subparagraph (F)(i) and section 13515(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Extrapolation</h4>
