<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 12856. Federal Compliance With Right-to-Know Laws and Pollution Prevention Requirements</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12856, Aug. 3, 1993, 58 F.R. 41981, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act of 1986 (42 U.S.C. 11001&ndash;11050) (EPCRA) established programs to provide the public with important information on the hazardous and toxic chemicals in their communities, and established emergency planning and notification requirements to protect the public in the event of a release of extremely hazardous substances;</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the Federal Government should be a good neighbor to local communities by becoming a leader in providing information to the public concerning toxic and hazardous chemicals and extremely hazardous substances at Federal facilities, and in planning for and preventing harm to the public through the planned or unplanned releases of chemicals;</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the Pollution Prevention Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 13101&ndash;13109) (PPA) established that it is the national policy of the United States that, whenever feasible, pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source; that pollution that cannot be prevented should <!-- PDFPage:5486 -->be recycled in an environmentally safe manner; that pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner; and that disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner;</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the PPA required the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to promote source reduction practices in other agencies;</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the Federal Government should become a leader in the field of pollution prevention through the management of its facilities, its acquisition practices, and in supporting the development of innovative pollution prevention programs and technologies;</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, the environmental, energy, and economic benefits of energy and water use reductions are very significant; the scope of innovative pollution prevention programs must be broad to adequately address the highest-risk environmental problems and to take full advantage of technological opportunities in sectors other than industrial manufacturing; the Energy Policy Act of 1992 (Public Law 102&ndash;486 of October 24, 1992) [see Tables for classification] requires the Secretary of Energy to work with other Federal agencies to significantly reduce the use of energy and reduce the related environmental impacts by promoting use of energy efficiency and renewable energy technologies; and</p>
<p class="note-body">WHEREAS, as the largest single consumer in the Nation, the Federal Government has the opportunity to realize significant economic as well as environmental benefits of pollution prevention;</p>
<p class="note-body">AND IN ORDER TO:</p>
<p class="note-body">Ensure that all Federal agencies conduct their facility management and acquisition activities so that, to the maximum extent practicable, the quantity of toxic chemicals entering any wastestream, including any releases to the environment, is reduced as expeditiously as possible through source reduction; that waste that is generated is recycled to the maximum extent practicable; and that any wastes remaining are stored, treated or disposed of in a manner protective of public health and the environment;</p>
<p class="note-body">Require Federal agencies to report in a public manner toxic chemicals entering any wastestream from their facilities, including any releases to the environment, and to improve local emergency planning, response, and accident notification; and</p>
<p class="note-body">Help encourage markets for clean technologies and safe alternatives to extremely hazardous substances or toxic chemicals through revisions to specifications and standards, the acquisition and procurement process, and the testing of innovative pollution prevention technologies at Federal facilities or in acquisitions;</p>
<p class="note-body">NOW THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the EPCRA, the PPA, and section 301 of title 5[3], United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Applicability.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;101. As delineated below, the head of each Federal agency is responsible for ensuring that all necessary actions are taken for the prevention of pollution with respect to that agency's activities and facilities, and for ensuring that agency's compliance with pollution prevention and emergency planning and community right-to-know provisions established pursuant to all implementing regulations issued pursuant to EPCRA and PPA.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;102. Except as otherwise noted, this order is applicable to all Federal agencies that either own or operate a &ldquo;facility&rdquo; as that term is defined in section 329(4) of EPCRA [42 U.S.C. 11049(4)], if such facility meets the threshold requirements set forth in EPCRA for compliance as modified by section 3&ndash;304(b) of this order (&ldquo;covered facilities&rdquo;). Except as provided in section 1&ndash;103 and section 1&ndash;104 below, each Federal agency must apply all of the provisions of this order to each of its covered facilities, including those facilities which are subject, independent of this order, to the provisions of EPCRA and PPA (<em>e.g</em>., certain Government-owned/contractor-operated facilities (GOCO's), for chemicals meeting EPCRA thresholds). This order does not apply to Federal agency facilities outside the customs territory of the United States, such as United States diplomatic and consular missions abroad.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;103. Nothing in this order alters the obligations which GOCO's and Government corporation facilities have under EPCRA and PPA independent of this order or subjects such facilities to EPCRA or PPA if they are otherwise excluded. However, consistent with section 1&ndash;104 below, each Federal agency shall include the releases and transfers from all such facilities when meeting all of the Federal agency's responsibilities under this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;104. To facilitate compliance with this order, each Federal agency shall provide, in all future contracts between the agency and its relevant contractors, for the contractor to supply to the Federal agency all information the Federal agency deems necessary for it to comply with this order. In addition, to the extent that compliance with this order is made more difficult due to lack of information from existing contractors, Federal agencies shall take practical steps to obtain the information needed to comply with this order from such contractors.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2&ndash;2. <em>Definitions.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;201. All definitions found in EPCRA and PPA and implementing regulations are incorporated in this order by reference, with the following exception: for the purposes of this order, the term &ldquo;person&rdquo;, as defined in section 329(7) of EPCRA [42 U.S.C. 11049(7)], also includes Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;202. <em>Federal agency</em> means an Executive agency, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 105. For the purpose of this order, military departments, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, are covered under the auspices of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;203. <em>Pollution Prevention</em> means &ldquo;source reduction,&rdquo; as defined in the PPA [see 42 U.S.C. 13102(5)], and other practices that reduce or eliminate the creation of pollutants through: (a) increased efficiency in the use of raw materials, energy, water, or other resources; or (b) protection of natural resources by conservation.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;204. <em>GOCO</em> means a Government-owned/contractor-operated facility which is owned by the Federal Government but all or portions of which are operated by private contractors.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;205. <em>Administrator</em> means the Administrator of the EPA.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;206. <em>Toxic Chemical</em> means a substance on the list described in section 313(c) of EPCRA [42 U.S.C. 11023(c)].</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;207. <em>Toxic Pollutants</em>. For the purposes of section 3&ndash;302(a) of this order, the term &ldquo;toxic pollutants&rdquo; shall include, but is not necessarily limited to, those chemicals at a Federal facility subject to the provisions of section 313 of EPCRA [42 U.S.C. 11023] as of December 1, 1993. Federal agencies also may choose to include releases and transfers of other chemicals, such as &ldquo;extremely hazardous chemicals&rdquo; as defined in section 329(3) of EPCRA [42 U.S.C. 11049(3)], hazardous wastes as defined under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976 (42 U.S.C. 6901&ndash;6986) (RCRA), or hazardous air pollutants under the Clean Air Act Amendments (42 U.S.C. 7403&ndash;7626); however, for the purposes of establishing the agency's baseline under 3&ndash;302(c), such &ldquo;other chemicals&rdquo; are in addition to (not instead of) the section 313 chemicals. The term &ldquo;toxic pollutants&rdquo; does not include hazardous waste subject to remedial action generated prior to the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3&ndash;3. <em>Implementation.</em></p>

A copy thereof shall be provided to the Administrator. Federal agencies are encouraged to involve the public in developing the required strategies under this order and in monitoring their subsequent progress in meeting the requirements of this order. The strategy shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following elements:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5487 --><p class="note-body">(a) A pollution prevention policy statement, developed by each Federal agency, designating principal responsibilities for development, implementation, and evaluation of the strategy. The statement shall reflect the Federal agency's commitment to incorporate pollution prevention through source reduction in facility management and acquisition, and it shall identify an individual responsible for coordinating the Federal agency's efforts in this area.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) A commitment to utilize pollution prevention through source reduction, where practicable, as the primary means of achieving and maintaining compliance with all applicable Federal, State, and local environmental requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">3&ndash;302. <em>Toxic Chemical Reduction Goals</em>. (a) The head of each Federal agency subject to this order shall ensure that the agency develops voluntary goals to reduce the agency's total releases of toxic chemicals to the environment and off-site transfers of such toxic chemicals for treatment and disposal from facilities covered by this order by 50 percent by December 31, 1999. To the maximum extent practicable, such reductions shall be achieved by implementation of source reduction practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The baseline for measuring reductions for purposes of achieving the 50 percent reduction goal for each Federal agency shall be the first year in which releases of toxic chemicals to the environment and off-site transfers of such chemicals for treatment and disposal are publicly reported. The baseline amount as to which the 50 percent reduction goal applies shall be the aggregate amount of toxic chemicals reported in the baseline year for all of that Federal agency's facilities meeting the threshold applicability requirements set forth in section 1&ndash;102 of this order. In no event shall the baseline be later than the 1994 reporting year.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Alternatively, a Federal agency may choose to achieve a 50 percent reduction goal for toxic pollutants. In such event, the Federal agency shall delineate the scope of its reduction program in the written pollution prevention strategy that is required by section 3&ndash;301 of this order. The baseline for measuring reductions for purposes of achieving the 50 percent reduction requirement for each Federal agency shall be the first year in which releases of toxic pollutants to the environment and off-site transfers of such chemicals for treatment and disposal are publicly reported for each of that Federal agency's facilities encompassed by section 3&ndash;301. In no event shall the baseline year be later than the 1994 reporting year. The baseline amount as to which the 50 percent reduction goal applies shall be the aggregate amount of toxic pollutants reported by the agency in the baseline year. For any toxic pollutants included by the agency in determining its baseline under this section, in addition to toxic chemicals under EPCRA, the agency shall report on such toxic pollutants annually under the provisions of section 3&ndash;304 of this order, if practicable, or through an agency report that is made available to the public.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The head of each Federal agency shall ensure that each of its covered facilities develops a written pollution prevention plan no later than the end of 1995, which sets forth the facility's contribution to the goal established in section 3&ndash;302(a) of this order. Federal agencies shall conduct assessments of their facilities as necessary to ensure development of such plans and of the facilities&rsquo; pollution prevention programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">3&ndash;303. <em>Acquisition and Procurement Goals</em>. (a) Each Federal agency shall establish a plan and goals for eliminating or reducing the unnecessary acquisition by that agency of products containing extremely hazardous substances or toxic chemicals. Similarly, each Federal agency shall establish a plan and goal for voluntarily reducing its own manufacturing, processing, and use of extremely hazardous substances and toxic chemicals. Priorities shall be developed by Federal agencies, in coordination with EPA, for implementing this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Within 24 months of the date of this order, the Department of Defense (DOD) and the General Services Administration (GSA), and other agencies, as appropriate, shall review their agency's standardized documents, including specifications and standards, and identify opportunities to eliminate or reduce the use by their agency of extremely hazardous substances and toxic chemicals, consistent with the safety and reliability requirements of their agency mission. The EPA shall assist agencies in meeting the requirements of this section, including identifying substitutes and setting priorities for these reviews. By 1999, DOD, GSA and other affected agencies shall make all appropriate revisions to these specifications and standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Any revisions to the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) necessary to implement this order shall be made within 24 months of the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Federal agencies are encouraged to develop and test innovative pollution prevention technologies at their facilities in order to encourage the development of strong markets for such technologies. Partnerships should be encouraged between industry, Federal agencies, Government laboratories, academia, and others to assess and deploy innovative environmental technologies for domestic use and for markets abroad.</p>
<p class="note-body">3&ndash;304. <em>Toxics Release Inventory/Pollution Prevention Act Reporting</em>.
