<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as otherwise required by law, the disclosure is to a health plan for purposes of carrying out payment or health care operations (and is not for purposes of carrying out treatment); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the protected health information pertains solely to a health care item or service for which the health care provider involved has been paid out of pocket in full.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disclosures required to be limited to the limited data set or the minimum necessary</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), a covered entity shall be treated as being in compliance with section 164.502(b)(1) of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to the use, disclosure, or request of protected health information described in such section, only if the covered entity limits such protected health information, to the extent practicable, to the limited data set (as defined in section 164.514(e)(2) of such title) or, if needed by such entity, to the minimum necessary to accomplish the intended purpose of such use, disclosure, or request, respectively.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The exceptions described in section 164.502(b)(2) of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, shall apply to the requirement under paragraph (1) as of the effective date described in section 13423&nbsp;<sup><a href="#17935_2_target" name="17935_2">2</a></sup> in the same manner that such exceptions apply to section 164.502(b)(1) of such title before such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The purpose of the exchange is for research (as described in sections 164.501 and 164.512(i) of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations) and the price charged reflects the costs of preparation and transmittal of the data for such purpose.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8114 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The purpose of the exchange is for the treatment of the individual, subject to any regulation that the Secretary may promulgate to prevent protected health information from inappropriate access, use, or disclosure.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 18 months after February 17, 2009, the Secretary shall promulgate regulations to carry out this subsection. In promulgating such regulations, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall evaluate the impact of restricting the exception described in paragraph (2)(A) to require that the price charged for the purposes described in such paragraph reflects the costs of the preparation and transmittal of the data for such purpose, on research or public health activities, including those conducted by or for the use of the Food and Drug Administration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may further restrict the exception described in paragraph (2)(A) to require that the price charged for the purposes described in such paragraph reflects the costs of the preparation and transmittal of the data for such purpose, if the Secretary finds that such further restriction will not impede such research or public health activities.</p>
