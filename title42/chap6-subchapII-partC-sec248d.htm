<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Defense, in consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Transportation when the Coast Guard is not operating as a service in the Navy, shall submit annually to the Committees on Appropriations and on Armed Services of the Senate and the House of Representatives a written report on the results of the studies and projects carried out under this section.
