<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall carry out a 5-year program, in accordance with sections 13541 and 13542 of this title, on high-temperature superconducting electric power equipment technologies. Elements of the program shall include, but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) activities that address the development of high-temperature superconducting materials that have increased electrical current capacity, which shall be the emphasis of the program for the near-term;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the development of prototypes, where appropriate, of the major elements of a superconducting electric power system such as motors, generators, transmission lines, transformers, and magnetic energy storage systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) activities that will improve the efficiency of materials performance of higher temperatures and at all magnetic field orientations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) development of prototypes based on high-temperature superconducting wire, that operate at the highest temperature possible, and refrigeration systems using cryogenics such as nitrogen;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) activities that will assist the private sector with designs for more efficient electric power generation and delivery systems which are cost competitive with conventional energy systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) development of prototypes that have application in both the commercial and defense sectors.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary is also encouraged to expedite government, laboratory, industry, and university collaborative agreements under existing mechanisms at the Department of Energy in coordination with other Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for carrying out this section $21,900,000 for fiscal year 1993 and such sums as may be necessary for subsequent fiscal years, to be derived from sums authorized under section 13471(c) of this title.</p>
