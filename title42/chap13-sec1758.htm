Such forms and descriptive material may not contain the income eligibility guidelines for free lunches.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), each eligibility determination shall be made on the basis of a complete application executed by an adult member of the household. The Secretary, State, or local food authority may verify any data contained in such application. A local school food authority shall undertake such verification of information contained in any such application as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe and, in accordance with such regulations, shall make appropriate changes in the eligibility determination with respect to such application on the basis of such verification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Subject to clause (iii), any school food authority may certify any child as eligible for free or reduced price lunches or breakfasts, without further application, by directly communicating with the appropriate State or local agency to obtain documentation of such child's status as a member of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) a family that is receiving assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.] that the Secretary determines complies with standards established by the Secretary that ensure that the standards under the State program are comparable to or more restrictive than those in effect on June 1, 1995.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The use or disclosure of any information obtained from an application for free or reduced price meals, or from a State or local agency referred to in clause (ii), shall be limited to&mdash;</p>

A routine change in the policy of a school food authority, such as an annual adjustment of the income eligibility guidelines for free and re<!-- PDFPage:2793 -->duced price meals, shall not be sufficient cause for requiring the school food authority to submit a policy statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any child who is a member of a household whose income, at the time the application is submitted, is at an annual rate which does not exceed the applicable family size income level of the income eligibility guidelines for free lunches, as determined under paragraph (1), shall be served a free lunch.

The price charged for a reduced price lunch shall not exceed 40 cents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No physical segregation of or other discrimination against any child eligible for a free lunch or a reduced price lunch under this subsection shall be made by the school nor shall there by&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1758_1_target" name="1758_1">1</a></sup> any overt identification of any child by special tokens or tickets, announced or published lists of names, or by other means.</p>

Local school authorities shall publicly announce that such children are eligible for a free or reduced price lunch, and shall make determinations with respect to the status of any parent or guardian of any child under clauses (A) and (B) of the preceding sentence on the basis of a statement executed in such form as the Secretary may prescribe by such parent or guardian. No physical segregation of, or other discrimination against, any child eligible for a free or reduced price lunch under this paragraph shall be made by the school nor shall there be any overt identification of any such child by special tokens or tickets, announced or published lists of names, or by any other means.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Proof of receipt of food stamps or assistance under the State program funded under part A of title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) that the Secretary determines complies with standards established by the Secretary that ensure that the standards under the State program are comparable to or more restrictive than those in effect on June 1, 1995, or of enrollment or participation in a Head Start program on the basis described in subparagraph (A)(iii), shall be sufficient to satisfy any verification requirement imposed under paragraph (2)(C).</p>
