<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) disability is a natural part of the human experience that does not diminish the right of individuals with developmental disabilities to live independently, to exert control and choice over their own lives, and to fully participate in and contribute to their communities through full integration and inclusion in the economic, political, social, cultural, and educational mainstream of United States society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in 1999, there were between 3,200,000 and 4,500,000 individuals with developmental disabilities in the United States, and recent studies indicate that individuals with developmental disabilities comprise between 1.2 and 1.65 percent of the United States population;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) individuals whose disabilities occur during their developmental period frequently have severe disabilities that are likely to continue indefinitely;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) individuals with developmental disabilities often encounter discrimination in the provision of critical services, such as services in the areas of emphasis (as defined in section 15002 of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) individuals with developmental disabilities are at greater risk than the general population of abuse, neglect, financial and sexual exploitation, and the violation of their legal and human rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a substantial portion of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families do not have access to appropriate support and services, including access to assistive technology, from generic and specialized service systems, and remain unserved or underserved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) individuals with developmental disabilities often require lifelong community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance, that are most effective when provided in a coordinated manner;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) there is a need to ensure that services, supports, and other assistance are provided in a culturally competent manner, that ensures that individuals from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds are fully included in all activities provided under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) family members, friends, and members of the community can play an important role in enhancing the lives of individuals with developmental disabilities, especially when the family members, friends, and community members are provided with the necessary community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) current research indicates that 88 percent of individuals with developmental disabilities live with their families or in their own households;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) many service delivery systems and communities are not prepared to meet the impending needs of the 479,862 adults with developmental disabilities who are living at home with parents who are 60 years old or older and who serve as the primary caregivers of the adults;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) in almost every State, individuals with developmental disabilities are waiting for appropriate services in their communities, in the areas of emphasis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) the public needs to be made more aware of the capabilities and competencies of indi<!-- PDFPage:6535 -->viduals with developmental disabilities, particularly in cases in which the individuals are provided with necessary services, supports, and other assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) as increasing numbers of individuals with developmental disabilities are living, learning, working, and participating in all aspects of community life, there is an increasing need for a well trained workforce that is able to provide the services, supports, and other forms of direct assistance required to enable the individuals to carry out those activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) there needs to be greater effort to recruit individuals from minority backgrounds into professions serving individuals with developmental disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) the goals of the Nation properly include a goal of providing individuals with developmental disabilities with the information, skills, opportunities, and support to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) make informed choices and decisions about their lives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) live in homes and communities in which such individuals can exercise their full rights and responsibilities as citizens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) pursue meaningful and productive lives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) contribute to their families, communities, and States, and the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) have interdependent friendships and relationships with other persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) live free of abuse, neglect, financial and sexual exploitation, and violations of their legal and human rights; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) achieve full integration and inclusion in society, in an individualized manner, consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities of each individual; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) as the Nation, States, and communities maintain and expand community living options for individuals with developmental disabilities, there is a need to evaluate the access to those options by individuals with developmental disabilities and the effects of those options on individuals with developmental disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to assure that individuals with developmental disabilities and their families participate in the design of and have access to needed community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance that promote self-determination, independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion in all facets of community life, through culturally competent programs authorized under this subchapter, including specifically&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) State Councils on Developmental Disabilities in each State to engage in advocacy, capacity building, and systemic change activities that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contribute to a coordinated, consumer- and family-centered, consumer- and family-directed, comprehensive system that includes needed community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance that promote self-determination for individuals with developmental disabilities and their families;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) protection and advocacy systems in each State to protect the legal and human rights of individuals with developmental disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) University Centers for Excellence in Developmental Disabilities Education, Research, and Service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide interdisciplinary pre-service preparation and continuing education of students and fellows, which may include the preparation and continuing education of leadership, direct service, clinical, or other personnel to strengthen and increase the capacity of States and communities to achieve the purpose of this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide community services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that provide training and technical assistance for individuals with developmental disabilities, their families, professionals, paraprofessionals, policymakers, students, and other members of the community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that may provide services, supports, and assistance for the persons described in clause (i) through demonstration and model activities;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to conduct research, which may include basic or applied research, evaluation, and the analysis of public policy in areas that affect or could affect, either positively or negatively, individuals with developmental disabilities and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to disseminate information related to activities undertaken to address the purpose of this subchapter, especially dissemination of information that demonstrates that the network authorized under this part is a national and international resource that includes specific substantive areas of expertise that may be accessed and applied in diverse settings and circumstances; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States that all programs, projects, and activities receiving assistance under this subchapter shall be carried out in a manner consistent with the principles that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) individuals with developmental disabilities, including those with the most severe developmental disabilities, are capable of self-determination, independence, productivity, and integration and inclusion in all facets of community life, but often require the provision of community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) individuals with developmental disabilities and their families have competencies, ca<!-- PDFPage:6536 -->pabilities, and personal goals that should be recognized, supported, and encouraged, and any assistance to such individuals should be provided in an individualized manner, consistent with the unique strengths, resources, priorities, concerns, abilities, and capabilities of such individuals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) individuals with developmental disabilities and their families are the primary decisionmakers regarding the services and supports such individuals and their families receive, including regarding choosing where the individuals live from available options, and play decisionmaking roles in policies and programs that affect the lives of such individuals and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) services, supports, and other assistance should be provided in a manner that demonstrates respect for individual dignity, personal preferences, and cultural differences;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) specific efforts must be made to ensure that individuals with developmental disabilities from racial and ethnic minority backgrounds and their families enjoy increased and meaningful opportunities to access and use community services, individualized supports, and other forms of assistance available to other individuals with developmental disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) recruitment efforts in disciplines related to developmental disabilities relating to pre-service training, community training, practice, administration, and policymaking must focus on bringing larger numbers of racial and ethnic minorities into the disciplines in order to provide appropriate skills, knowledge, role models, and sufficient personnel to address the growing needs of an increasingly diverse population;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) with education and support, communities can be accessible to and responsive to the needs of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families and are enriched by full and active participation in community activities, and contributions, by individuals with developmental disabilities and their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) individuals with developmental disabilities have access to opportunities and the necessary support to be included in community life, have interdependent relationships, live in homes and communities, and make contributions to their families, communities, and States, and the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) efforts undertaken to maintain or expand community-based living options for individuals with disabilities should be monitored in order to determine and report to appropriate individuals and entities the extent of access by individuals with developmental disabilities to those options and the extent of compliance by entities providing those options with quality assurance standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) families of children with developmental disabilities need to have access to and use of safe and appropriate child care and before-school and after-school programs, in the most integrated settings, in order to enrich the participation of the children in community life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) individuals with developmental disabilities need to have access to and use of public transportation, in order to be independent and directly contribute to and participate in all facets of community life; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) individuals with developmental disabilities need to have access to and use of recreational, leisure, and social opportunities in the most integrated settings, in order to enrich their participation in community life.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings respecting the rights of individuals with developmental disabilities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Individuals with developmental disabilities have a right to appropriate treatment, services, and habilitation for such disabilities, consistent with section 15001(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The treatment, services, and habitation&nbsp;<sup><a href="#15009_1_target" name="15009_1">1</a></sup> for an individual with developmental disabilities should be designed to maximize the potential of the individual and should be provided in the setting that is least restrictive of the individual's personal liberty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Federal Government and the States both have an obligation to ensure that public funds are provided only to institutional programs, residential programs, and other community programs, including educational programs in which individuals with developmental disabilities participate, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide treatment, services, and habilitation that are appropriate to the needs of such individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) meet minimum standards relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provision of care that is free of abuse, neglect, sexual and financial exploitation, and violations of legal and human rights and that subjects individuals with developmental disabilities to no greater risk of harm than others in the general population;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provision to such individuals of appropriate and sufficient medical and dental services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) prohibition of the use of physical restraint and seclusion for such an individual unless absolutely necessary to ensure the immediate physical safety of the individual or others, and prohibition of the use of such restraint and seclusion as a punishment or as a substitute for a habilitation program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) prohibition of the excessive use of chemical restraints on such individuals and the use of such restraints as punishment or as a substitute for a habilitation program or in quantities that interfere with services, treatment, or habilitation for such individuals; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6544 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) provision for close relatives or guardians of such individuals to visit the individuals without prior notice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) All programs for individuals with developmental disabilities should meet standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that are designed to assure the most favorable possible outcome for those served; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) in the case of residential programs serving individuals in need of comprehensive health-related, habilitative, assistive technology or rehabilitative services, that are at least equivalent to those standards applicable to intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded, promulgated in regulations of the Secretary on June 3, 1988, as appropriate, taking into account the size of the institutions and the service delivery arrangements of the facilities of the programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of other residential programs for individuals with developmental disabilities, that assure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) care is appropriate to the needs of the individuals being served by such programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the individuals admitted to facilities of such programs are individuals whose needs can be met through services provided by such facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) the facilities of such programs provide for the humane care of the residents of the facilities, are sanitary, and protect their rights; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the case of nonresidential programs, that assure that the care provided by such programs is appropriate to the individuals served by the programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Clarification</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each fiscal year, the Secretary shall, in accordance with regulations and this paragraph, allot the sums appropriated for such year under section 15029 of this title among the States on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the population;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the extent of need for services for individuals with developmental disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the financial need,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">of the respective States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Sums allotted to the States under this section shall be used to pay for the Federal share of the cost of carrying out projects in accordance with State plans approved under section 15024 of this title for the provision under such plans of services for individuals with developmental disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may make adjustments in the amounts of State allotments based on clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of paragraph (1)(A) not more often than annually. The Secretary shall notify each State of any adjustment made under this paragraph and the percentage of the total sums appropriated under section 15029 of this title that the adjusted allotment represents not later than 6 months before the beginning of the fiscal year in which such adjustment is to take effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Minimum allotment for appropriations less than or equal to $70,000,000</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in paragraph (4), for any fiscal year the allotment under this section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), if the aggregate of the amounts to be allotted to the States pursuant to subparagraph (A) for any fiscal year exceeds the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title for such fiscal year, the amount to be allotted to each State for such fiscal year shall be proportionately reduced.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6545 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Minimum allotment for appropriations in excess of $70,000,000</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reduction of allotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirements of paragraph (3)(B) shall apply with respect to amounts to be allotted to States under subparagraph (A), in the same manner and to the same extent as such requirements apply with respect to amounts to be allotted to States under paragraph (3)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) State supports, services, and other activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A)(ii), the extent of need in any State for services for individuals with developmental disabilities, the Secretary shall take into account the scope and extent of the services, supports, and assistance described, pursuant to section 15024(c)(3)(A) of this title, in the State plan of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Increase in allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any year in which the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title for a fiscal year exceeds the total amount appropriated under such section (or a corresponding provision) for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of title 29 (if the percentage change indicates an increase), the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments described in paragraphs (3) and (4). The Secretary shall increase each minimum allotment by an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of such minimum allotment (including any increases in such minimum allotment under this paragraph (or a corresponding provision) for prior fiscal years) as the amount that is equal to the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title for the fiscal year for which the increase in the minimum allotment is being made; minus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for the immediately preceding fiscal year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">bears to the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for such preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unobligated funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any amount paid to a State for a fiscal year and remaining unobligated at the end of such year shall remain available to such State for the next fiscal year for the purposes for which such amount was paid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Obligation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this part, State Interagency Agreements are considered valid obligations for the purpose of obligating Federal funds allotted to the State under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Cooperative efforts between States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State plan approved in accordance with section 15024 of this title provides for cooperative or joint effort between or among States or agencies, public or private, in more than 1 State, portions of funds allotted to 1 or more States described in this subsection may be combined in accordance with the agreements between the States or agencies involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reallotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that an amount of an allotment to a State for a period (of a fiscal year or longer) will not be required by the State during the period for the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Secretary may reallot the amount.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may make such a reallotment from time to time, on such date as the Secretary may fix, but not earlier than 30 days after the Secretary has published notice of the intention of the Secretary to make the reallotment in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reallot the amount to other States with respect to which the Secretary has not made that determination. The Secretary shall reallot the amount in proportion to the original allotments of the other States for such fiscal year, but shall reduce such proportionate amount for any of the other States to the extent the proportionate amount exceeds the sum that the Secretary estimates the State needs and will be able to use during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reallotment of reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall similarly reallot the total of the reductions among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amount reallotted to a State under this subsection for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of the allotment of the State under subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year.</p>
