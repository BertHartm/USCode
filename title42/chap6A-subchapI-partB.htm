<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;505, title IV, &sect;402, Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2336, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Over 700 lives are lost every day to sudden cardiac arrest in the United States alone.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Two out of every three sudden cardiac deaths occur before a victim can reach a hospital.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) More than 95 percent of these cardiac arrest victims will die, many because of lack of readily available life saving medical equipment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) With current medical technology, up to 30 percent of cardiac arrest victims could be saved if victims had access to immediate medical response, including defibrillation and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Once a victim has suffered a cardiac arrest, every minute that passes before returning the heart to a normal rhythm decreases the chance of survival by 10 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Most cardiac arrests are caused by abnormal heart rhythms called ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation occurs when the heart's electrical system malfunctions, causing a chaotic rhythm that prevents the heart from pumping oxygen to the victim's brain and body.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Communities that have implemented programs ensuring widespread public access to defibrillators, combined with appropriate training, maintenance, and coordination with local emergency medical systems, have dramatically improved the survival rates from cardiac arrest.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Automated external defibrillator devices have been demonstrated to be safe and effective, even when used by lay people, since the devices are designed not to allow a user to administer a shock until after the device has analyzed a victim's heart rhythm and determined that an electric shock is required.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Increasing public awareness regarding automated external defibrillator devices and encouraging their use in Federal buildings will greatly facilitate their adoption.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Limiting the liability of Good Samaritans and acquirers of automated external defibrillator devices in emergency situations may encourage the use of automated external defibrillator devices, and result in saved lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;129, &sect;7, Dec. 6, 1999, 113 Stat. 1676, provided that: &ldquo;The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, in consultation with the Administrator of the General Services Administration and other appropriate public and private entities, develop recommendations regarding the placement of automatic external defibrillators in Federal buildings as a means of improving the survival rates of individuals who experience <!-- PDFPage:139 -->cardiac arrest in such buildings, including recommendations on training, maintenance, and medical oversight, and on coordinating with the system for emergency medical services.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Good Samaritan protections regarding AEDs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any person who uses or attempts to use an automated external defibrillator device on a victim of a perceived medical emergency is immune from civil liability for any harm resulting from the use or attempted use of such device; and in addition, any person who acquired the device is immune from such liability, if the harm was not due to the failure of such acquirer of the device&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to notify local emergency response personnel or other appropriate entities of the most recent placement of the device within a reasonable period of time after the device was placed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to properly maintain and test the device; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide appropriate training in the use of the device to an employee or agent of the acquirer when the employee or agent was the person who used the device on the victim, except that such requirement of training does not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the employee or agent was not an employee or agent who would have been reasonably expected to use the device; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the period of time elapsing between the engagement of the person as an employee or agent and the occurrence of the harm (or between the acquisition of the device and the occurrence of the harm, in any case in which the device was acquired after such engagement of the person) was not a reasonably sufficient period in which to provide the training.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Inapplicability of immunity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Immunity under subsection (a) of this section does not apply to a person if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the harm involved was caused by willful or criminal misconduct, gross negligence, reckless misconduct, or a conscious, flagrant indifference to the rights or safety of the victim who was harmed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person is a licensed or certified health professional who used the automated external defibrillator device while acting within the scope of the license or certification of the professional and within the scope of the employment or agency of the professional;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the person is a hospital, clinic, or other entity whose purpose is providing health care directly to patients, and the harm was caused by an employee or agent of the entity who used the device while acting within the scope of the employment or agency of the employee or agent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the person is an acquirer of the device who leased the device to a health care entity (or who otherwise provided the device to such entity for compensation without selling the device to the entity), and the harm was caused by an employee or agent of the entity who used the device while acting within the scope of the employment or agency of the employee or agent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules of construction</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The following applies with respect to this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) This section does not establish any cause of action, or require that an automated external defibrillator device be placed at any building or other location.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) With respect to a class of persons for which this section provides immunity from civil liability, this section supersedes the law of a State only to the extent that the State has no statute or regulations that provide persons in such class with immunity for civil liability arising from the use by such persons of automated external defibrillator devices in emergency situations (within the meaning of the State law or regulation involved).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) This section does not waive any protection from liability for Federal officers or employees under&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) sections 1346(b), 2672, and 2679 of title 28 or under alternative benefits provided by the United States where the availability of such benefits precludes a remedy under section 1346(b) of title 28.</p>
