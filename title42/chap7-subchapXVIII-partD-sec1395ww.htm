<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) The Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments that may be made <!-- PDFPage:2100 -->under this subchapter with respect to operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in paragraph (4)) shall not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of health services) costs for the provision of such services by a hospital for a cost reporting period to the extent such costs exceed the applicable percentage (as determined under clause (ii)) of the average of such costs for all hospitals in the same grouping as such hospital for comparable time periods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage for hospital cost reporting periods beginning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) on or after October 1, 1982, and before October 1, 1983, is 120 percent;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A) the Secretary shall establish case mix indexes for all short-term hospitals, and shall set limits for each hospital based upon the general mix of types of medical cases with respect to which such hospital provides services for which payment may be made under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall set such limits for a cost reporting period of a hospital&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) by updating available data for a previous period to the immediate preceding cost reporting period by the estimated average rate of change of hospital costs industry-wide, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The limitation established under subparagraph (A) for any hospital shall in no event be lower than the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in paragraph (4)) recognized under this subchapter for such hospital for such hospital's last cost reporting period prior to the hospital's first cost reporting period for which this section is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall provide for such exemptions from, and exceptions and adjustments to, the limitation established under paragraph (1)(A) as he deems appropriate, including those which he deems necessary to take into account&mdash;</p>

The Secretary may provide for such other exemptions from, and exceptions and adjustments to, such method as the Secretary deems appropriate, including the assignment of a new base period which is more representative, as determined by the Secretary, of the reasonable and necessary cost of inpatient services and including those which he deems necessary to take into account a decrease in the inpatient hospital services that a hospital provides and that are customarily provided directly by similar hospitals which results in a significant distortion in the operating costs of inpatient hospital services. The Secretary shall announce a decision on any request for an exemption, exception, or adjustment under this paragraph not later than 180 days after receiving a completed application from the intermediary for such exemption, exception, or adjustment, and <!-- PDFPage:2105 -->shall include in such decision a detailed explanation of the grounds on which such request was approved or denied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The payment reductions under paragraph (3)(B)(ii)(V) shall not be considered by the Secretary in making adjustments pursuant to clause (i).

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In applying subparagraph (A)(i)(II) in the case of a hospital or unit, the Secretary shall provide for an appropriate adjustment to the labor-related portion of the amount determined under such subparagraph to take into account differences between average wage-related costs in the area of the hospital and the national average of such costs within the same class of hospital.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment in accordance with State hospital reimbursement control system; amount of payment; discontinuance of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may provide, in his discretion, that payment with respect to services provided by a hospital in a State may be made in accordance with a hospital reimbursement control system in a State, rather than in accordance with the other provisions of this title, if the chief executive officer of the State requests such treatment and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary determines that the system, if approved under this subsection, will apply (i) to substantially all non-Federal acute care hospitals (as defined by the Secretary) in the State and (ii) to the review of at least 75 percent of all revenues or expenses in the State for inpatient hospital services and of revenues or expenses for inpatient hospital services provided under the State's plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary has been provided satisfactory assurances as to the equitable treatment under the system of all entities (including Federal and State programs) that pay hospitals for inpatient hospital services, of hospital employees, and of hospital patients;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary has been provided satisfactory assurances that under the system, over 36-month periods (the first such period beginning with the first month in which this subsection applies to that system in the State), <!-- PDFPage:2106 -->the amount of payments made under this subchapter under such system will not exceed the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Secretary determines that the system will not preclude an eligible organization (as defined in section 1395mm(b) of this title) from negotiating directly with hospitals with respect to the organization's rate of payment for inpatient hospital services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the Secretary determines that the system requires hospitals to meet the requirement of section 1395cc(a)(1)(G) of this title and the system provides for the exclusion of certain costs in accordance with section 1395y(a)(14) of this title (except for such waivers thereof as the Secretary provides by regulation).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary cannot deny the application of a State under this subsection on the ground that the State's hospital reimbursement control system is based on a payment methodology other than on the basis of a diagnosis-related group or on the ground that the amount of payments made under this subchapter under such system must be less than the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system. If the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subparagraph (C) are based on maintaining payment amounts at no more than a specified percentage increase above the payment amounts in a base period, the State has the option of applying such test (for inpatient hospital services under part A of this subchapter) on an aggregate payment basis or on the basis of the amount of payment per inpatient discharge or admission. If the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subparagraph (C) are based on maintaining aggregate payment amounts below a national average percentage increase in total payments under part A of this subchapter for inpatient hospital services, the Secretary cannot deny the application of a State under this subsection on the ground that the State's rate of increase in such payments for such services must be less than such national average rate of increase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining under paragraph (1)(C) the amount of payment which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter for a State, the Secretary may provide for appropriate adjustment of such amount to take into account previous reductions effected in the amount of payments made under this subchapter in the State due to the operation of the hospital reimbursement control system in the State if the system has resulted in an aggregate rate of increase in operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section) under this subchapter for hospitals in the State which is less than the aggregate rate of increase in such costs under this subchapter for hospitals in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall discontinue payments under a system described in paragraph (1) if the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determines that the system no longer meets the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) and, if applicable, the requirements of paragraph (5), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) has reason to believe that the assurances described in subparagraph (B) or (C) of paragraph (1) (or, if applicable, in paragraph (5)) are not being (or will not be) met.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall approve the request of a State under paragraph (1) with respect to a hospital reimbursement control system if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the requirements of subparagraphs (A), (B), (C), (D), and (E) of paragraph (1) have been met with respect to the system, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to that system a waiver of certain requirements of this subchapter has been approved on or before (and which is in effect as of) April 20, 1983, pursuant to section 1395b&ndash;1(a) of this title or section 222(a) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">With respect to a State system described in this paragraph, the Secretary shall judge the effectiveness of such system on the basis of its rate of increase or inflation in inpatient hospital payments for individuals under this subchapter, as compared to the national rate of increase or inflation for such payments, with the State retaining the option to have the test applied on the basis of the aggregate payments under the State system as compared to aggregate payments which would have been made under the national system since October 1, 1984, to the most recent date for which annual data are available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall approve the request of a State under paragraph (1) with respect to a hospital reimbursement control system if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines that the system&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is operated directly by the State or by an entity designated pursuant to State law,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provides for payment of hospitals covered under the system under a methodology (which sets forth exceptions and adjustments, as well as any method for changes in the methodology) by which rates or amounts to be paid for hospital services during a specified period are established under the system prior to the defined rate period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) hospitals covered under the system will make such reports (in lieu of cost and other reports, identified by the Secretary, otherwise required under this subchapter) as the Secretary may require in order to properly monitor assurances provided under this subsection;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the State has provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that operation of the system will not result in any change in hospital admission practices which result in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a significant reduction in the proportion of patients (receiving hospital services covered under the system) who have no third-party coverage and who are unable to pay for hospital services,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a significant reduction in the proportion of individuals admitted to hospitals for inpatient hospital services for which payment is (or is likely to be) less than the anticipated charges for or costs of such services,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2107 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the refusal to admit patients who would be expected to require unusually costly or prolonged treatment for reasons other than those related to the appropriateness of the care available at the hospital, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) the refusal to provide emergency services to any person who is in need of emergency services if the hospital provides such services;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any change by the State in the system which has the effect of materially reducing payments to hospitals can only take effect upon 60 days notice to the Secretary and to the hospitals the payment to which is likely to be materially affected by the change; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the State has provided the Secretary with satisfactory assurances that in the development of the system the State has consulted with local governmental officials concerning the impact of the system on public hospitals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall respond to requests of States under this paragraph within 60 days of the date the request is submitted to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) If the Secretary determines that the assurances described in paragraph (1)(C) have not been met with respect to any 36-month period, the Secretary may reduce payments under this subchapter to hospitals under the system in an amount equal to the amount by which the payment under this subchapter under such system for such period exceeded the amount of payments which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter not using such system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) In the case of a State which made a request under paragraph (5) before December 31, 1984, for the approval of a State hospital reimbursement control system and which request was approved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in applying paragraphs (1)(C) and (6), a reference to a &ldquo;36-month period&rdquo; is deemed a reference to a &ldquo;48-month period&rdquo;, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in order to allow the State the opportunity to provide the assurances described in paragraph (1)(C) for a 48-month period, the Secretary may not discontinue payments under the system, under the authority of paragraph (3)(A) because the Secretary has reason to believe that such assurances are not being (or will not be) met, before July 1, 1986.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall determine a national adjusted DRG prospective payment rate, for each inpatient hospital discharge in a fiscal year after fiscal year 1984 involving inpatient hospital services of a subsection (d) hospital in the United States, and shall determine a regional adjusted DRG prospective payment rate for such discharges in each region for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter. Each such rate shall be determined for hospitals located in large urban, other urban, or rural areas within the United States and within each such region, respectively, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning before October 1, 1987, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in an urban area and for hospitals located in a rural area within the United States and for hospitals located in an urban area and for hospitals located in a rural area within each region, equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under paragraph (2)(D) or under this subparagraph, increased for the fiscal year involved by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section. With respect to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1987, the Secretary shall compute urban and rural averages on the basis of discharge weighting rather than hospital weighting, making appropriate adjustments to ensure that computation on such basis does not result in total payments under this section that are greater or less than the total payments that would have been made under this section but for this sentence, and making appropriate changes in the manner of determining the reductions under subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1987, and ending on or before September 30, 1994, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in a large urban area, for hospitals located in a rural area, and for hospitals located in other urban areas, within the United States and within each re<!-- PDFPage:2110 -->gion, equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under this subparagraph increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section with respect to hospitals located in the respective areas for the fiscal year involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) For discharges occurring in the fiscal year beginning on October 1, 1994, the average standardized amount for hospitals located in a rural area shall be equal to the average standardized amount for hospitals located in an other&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395ww_4_target" name="1395ww_4">4</a></sup> urban area. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1994, the Secretary shall adjust the ratio of the labor portion to non-labor portion of each average standardized amount to equal such ratio for the national average of all standardized amounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) For discharges occurring in a fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1995, the Secretary shall compute an average standardized amount for hospitals located in a large urban area and for hospitals located in other areas within the United States and within each region equal to the respective average standardized amount computed for the previous fiscal year under this subparagraph increased by the applicable percentage increase under subsection (b)(3)(B)(i) of this section with respect to hospitals located in the respective areas for the fiscal year involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) Average standardized amounts computed under this paragraph shall be adjusted to reflect the most recent case-mix data available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) For discharges occurring in fiscal year 1985, the Secretary shall adjust each of such average standardized amounts as may be required under subsection (e)(1)(B) of this section for that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For discharges occurring after September 30, 1986, the Secretary shall further reduce each of the average standardized amounts (in a proportion which takes into account the differing effects of the standardization effected under paragraph (2)(C)(i)) so as to provide for a reduction in the total of the payments (attributable to this paragraph) made for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1986, of an amount equal to the estimated reduction in the payment amounts under paragraph (5)(B) that would have resulted from the enactment of the amendments made by section 9104 of the Medicare and Medicaid Budget Reconciliation Amendments of 1985 and by section 4003(a)(1) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987 if the factor described in clause (ii)(II) of paragraph (5)(B) (determined without regard to amendments made by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990) were applied for discharges occurring on or after such date instead of the factor described in clause (ii) of that paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) For each discharge classified within a diagnosis-related group, the Secretary shall establish for the fiscal year a national DRG prospective payment rate and shall establish a regional DRG prospective payment rate for each region, each of which is equal&mdash;</p>

Not later than October 1, 1990, and October 1, 1993 (and at least every 12 months thereafter), the Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of a survey conducted by the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs of subsection (d) hospitals in the United States. To the extent determined feasible by the Secretary, such survey shall measure the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category and shall exclude data with respect to the wages and wage-related costs incurred in furnishing skilled nursing facility services. Any adjustments or updates made under this subparagraph for a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1991) shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate payments under this subsection in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made in the year without such adjustment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary shall establish a classification of inpatient hospital discharges by diagnosis-related groups and a methodology for classifying specific hospital discharges within these groups.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For each such diagnosis-related group the Secretary shall assign an appropriate weighting <!-- PDFPage:2111 -->factor which reflects the relative hospital resources used with respect to discharges classified within that group compared to discharges classified within other groups.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The Secretary shall adjust the classifications and weighting factors established under subparagraphs (A) and (B), for discharges in fiscal year 1988 and at least annually thereafter, to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, and other factors which may change the relative use of hospital resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For discharges in fiscal year 1990, the Secretary shall reduce the weighting factor for each diagnosis-related group by 1.22 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Any such adjustment under clause (i) for discharges in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1991) shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate payments under this subsection for discharges in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made for discharges in the year without such adjustment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Secretary shall include recommendations with respect to adjustments to weighting factors under clause (i) in the annual report to Congress required under subsection (e)(3)(B) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A)(i) For discharges occurring during fiscal years ending on or before September 30, 1997, the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for a subsection (d) hospital for any discharge in a diagnosis-related group, the length of stay of which exceeds the mean length of stay for discharges within that group by a fixed number of days, or exceeds such mean length of stay by some fixed number of standard deviations, whichever is the fewer number of days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For cases which are not included in clause (i), a subsection (d) hospital may request additional payments in any case where charges, adjusted to cost, exceed a fixed multiple of the applicable DRG prospective payment rate, or exceed such other fixed dollar amount, whichever is greater, or, for discharges in fiscal years beginning on or after October 1, 1994, exceed the sum of the applicable DRG prospective payment rate plus any amounts payable under subparagraphs (B) and (F) plus a fixed dollar amount determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The amount of such additional payment under clauses (i) and (ii) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall (except as payments under clause (i) are required to be reduced to take into account the requirements of clause (v)) approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the cutoff point applicable under clause (i) or (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The total amount of the additional payments made under this subparagraph for discharges in a fiscal year may not be less than 5 percent nor more than 6 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on DRG prospective payment rates for discharges in that year.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;day outlier percentage&rdquo; means, for a fiscal year, the percentage of the total additional payments made by the Secretary under this subparagraph for discharges in that fiscal year which are additional payments under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall provide for an additional payment amount for subsection (d) hospitals with indirect costs of medical education, in an amount computed in the same manner as the adjustment for such costs under regulations (in effect as of January 1, 1983) under subsection (a)(2) of this section, except as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The amount of such additional payment shall be determined by multiplying (I) the sum of the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii)(II) (or, if applicable, the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii)) and, for cases qualifying for additional payment under subparagraph (A)(i), the amount paid to the hospital under subparagraph (A), by (II) the indirect teaching adjustment factor described in clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(II), the indirect teaching adjustment factor is equal to c �0A (((1+r) to the nth power) ^1), where &ldquo;r&rdquo; is the ratio of the hospital's full-time equivalent interns and residents to beds and &ldquo;n&rdquo; equals .405. For discharges occurring&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) In determining such adjustment the Secretary shall not distinguish between those interns and residents who are employees of a hospital and those interns and residents who furnish services to a hospital but are not employees of such hospital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Effective for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, all the time spent by an intern or resident in patient care activities under an approved medical residency training program at an entity in a nonhospital setting shall be counted towards the determination of full-time equivalency if the hospital incurs all, or substantially all, of the costs for the training program in that setting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) In determining the adjustment with respect to a hospital for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, the total number of full-time equivalent interns and residents in the fields of allopathic and osteopathic medicine in either a hospital or nonhospital setting may not exceed the number of such full-time equivalent interns and residents in the hospital with respect to the hospital's most recent cost reporting period ending on or before December 31, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) For purposes of clause (ii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) &ldquo;r&rdquo; may not exceed the ratio of the number of interns and residents, subject to <!-- PDFPage:2112 -->the limit under clause (v), with respect to the hospital for its most recent cost reporting period to the hospital's available beds (as defined by the Secretary) during that cost reporting period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) for the hospital's cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, subject to the limits described in clauses (iv) and (v), the total number of full-time equivalent residents for payment purposes shall equal the average of the actual full-time equivalent resident count for the cost reporting period and the preceding two cost reporting periods.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In the case of the first cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, subclause (II) shall be applied by using the average for such period and the preceding cost reporting period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vii) If any cost reporting period beginning on or after October 1, 1997, is not equal to twelve months, the Secretary shall make appropriate modifications to ensure that the average full-time equivalent residency count pursuant to subclause (II) of clause (vi) is based on the equivalent of full twelve-month cost reporting periods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(viii) Rules similar to the rules of subsection (h)(4)(H) shall apply for purposes of clauses (v) and (vi).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The Secretary shall provide for such exceptions and adjustments to the payment amounts established under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the special needs of regional and national referral centers (including those hospitals of 275 or more beds located in rural areas). A hospital which is classified as a rural hospital may appeal to the Secretary to be classified as a rural referral center under this clause on the basis of criteria (established by the Secretary) which shall allow the hospital to demonstrate that it should be so reclassified by reason of certain of its operating characteristics being similar to those of a typical urban hospital located in the same census region and which shall not require a rural osteopathic hospital to have more than 3,000 discharges in a year in order to be classified as a rural referral center. Such characteristics may include wages, scope of services, service area, and the mix of medical specialties. The Secretary shall publish the criteria not later than August 17, 1984, for implementation by October 1, 1984. An appeal allowed under this clause must be submitted to the Secretary (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe) during the quarter before the first quarter of the hospital's cost reporting period (or, in the case of a cost reporting period beginning during October 1984, during the first quarter of that period), and the Secretary must make a final determination with respect to such appeal within 60 days after the date the appeal was submitted. Any payment adjustments necessitated by a reclassification based upon the appeal shall be effective at the beginning of such cost reporting period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall provide, under clause (i), for the classification of a rural hospital as a regional referral center if the hospital has a case mix index equal to or greater than the median case mix index for hospitals (other than hospitals with approved teaching programs) located in an urban area in the same region (as defined in paragraph (2)(D)), has at least 5,000 discharges a year or, if less, the median number of discharges in urban hospitals in the region in which the hospital is located (or, in the case of a rural osteopathic hospital, meets the criterion established by the Secretary under clause (i) with respect to the annual number of discharges for such hospitals), and meets any other criteria established by the Secretary under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) For any cost reporting period beginning on or after April 1, 1990, with respect to a subsection (d) hospital which is a sole community hospital, payment under paragraph (1)(A) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) an amount based on 100 percent of the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period, as defined in subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever results in greater payment to the hospital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of a sole community hospital that experiences, in a cost reporting period compared to the previous cost reporting period, a decrease of more than 5 percent in its total number of inpatient cases due to circumstances beyond its control, the Secretary shall provide for such adjustment to the payment amounts under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as may be necessary to fully compensate the hospital for the fixed costs it incurs in the period in providing inpatient hospital services, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;sole community hospital&rdquo; means any hospital&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) that the Secretary determines is located more than 35 road miles from another hospital,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Secretary shall promulgate a standard for determining whether a hospital meets the criteria for classification as a sole community hospital under clause (iii)(II) because of the time required for an individual to travel to the nearest alternative source of appropriate inpatient care.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) If the Secretary determines that, in the case of a hospital located in a rural area and <!-- PDFPage:2113 -->designated by the Secretary as an essential access community hospital under section 1395i&ndash;4(i)(1) of this title as in effect on September 30, 1997, the hospital has incurred increases in reasonable costs during a cost reporting period as a result of becoming a member of a rural health network (as defined in section 1395i&ndash;4(d) of this title) in the State in which it is located, and in incurring such increases, the hospital will increase its costs for subsequent cost reporting periods, the Secretary shall increase the hospital's target amount under subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section to account for such incurred increases.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The Secretary shall estimate the amount of reimbursement made for services described in section 1395y(a)(14) of this title with respect to which payment was made under part B of this subchapter in the base reporting periods referred to in paragraph (2)(A) and with respect to which payment is no longer being made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall provide for an adjustment to the payment for subsection (d) hospitals in each fiscal year so as appropriately to reflect the net amount described in clause (i).</p>

Aggregate payments made under subsection (d) of this section and this subsection during fiscal years 1992 through 1995 shall be reduced in a manner that results in a reduction (as estimated by the Secretary) in the amount of such payments equal to a 10 percent reduction in the amount of payments attributable to capital-related costs that would otherwise have been made during such fiscal year had the amount of such payments been based on reasonable costs (as defined in section 1395x(v) of this title). For discharges occurring after September 30, 1993, the Secretary shall reduce by 7.4 percent the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate (as described in 42 CFR 412.308(c), as in effect on August 10, 1993) and shall (for hospital cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1993) redetermine which payment methodology is applied to the hospital under such system to take into account such reduction. In addition to the reduction described in the preceding sentence, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, the Secretary shall apply the budget neutrality adjustment factor used to determine the Federal capital payment rate in effect on September 30, 1995 (as described in section 412.352 of title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations), to (i) the unadjusted standard Federal capital payment rate (as described in section 412.308(c) of that title, as in effect on September 30, 1997), and (ii) the unadjusted hospital-specific rate (as described in section 412.328(e)(1) of that title, as in effect on September 30, 1997), and, for discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1997, and before September 30, 2002, reduce the rates described in clauses (i) and (ii) by 2.1 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such system&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In this paragraph, the &ldquo;applicable percentage&rdquo; is&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Insofar as the Secretary determines that such adjustments for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under the classification system during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of patients that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary shall adjust the per payment unit payment rate for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Data collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary is authorized to require rehabilitation facilities that provide inpatient hospital services to submit such data as the Secretary deems necessary to establish and administer the prospective payment system under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by updating such per-payment-unit amount to the fiscal year involved by the weighted average of the applicable percentage increases provided under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii) of this section (for cost reporting periods beginning during the fiscal year) covering the period from the midpoint of the period for such data through the midpoint of fiscal year 2000 and by an increase factor (described in subparagraph (C)) specified by the Secretary for subsequent fiscal years up to the fiscal year involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by reducing such rates by a factor equal to the proportion of payments under this subsection (as estimated by the Secretary) based on prospective payment amounts which are additional payments described in paragraph (4) (relating to outlier and related payments);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for variations among rehabilitation facilities by area under paragraph (6);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) by the weighting factors established under paragraph (2)(B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) by such other factors as the Secretary determines are necessary to properly reflect variations in necessary costs of treatment among rehabilitation facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Budget neutral rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish the prospective payment amounts under this subsection for payment units during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 at levels such that, in the Secretary's estimation, the amount of total payments under this subsection for such fiscal years (including any payment adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (6)) shall be equal to 98 percent of the amount of payments that would have been made under this subchapter during the fiscal years for operating and capital costs of rehabilitation facilities had this subsection not been enacted. In establishing such payment amounts, the Secretary shall consider the effects of the prospective payment system established under this subsection on the total number of payment units from rehabilitation facilities and other factors described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Increase factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection for payment units in each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001), the Secretary shall establish an increase factor.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Outlier and special payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Outliers</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may provide for an additional payment to a rehabilitation facility for patients in a case mix group, based upon the patient being classified as an outlier based on an unusual length of stay, costs, or other factors specified by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payment based on marginal cost of care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount of such additional payment under clause (i) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the cutoff point applicable under clause (i).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, on or before August 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001), of the classification and weighting factors for case mix groups under paragraph (2) for such fiscal year and a description of the methodology and data used in computing the prospective payment rates under this subsection for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Area wage adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall adjust the proportion (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of rehabilitation facilities&rsquo; costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the prospective payment rates computed under paragraph (3) for area differences in wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the rehabilitation facility compared to the national average wage level for such facilities. Not later than October 1, 2001 (and at least every 36 months thereafter), the Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of information available to the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs incurred in furnishing rehabilitation services. Any adjustments or updates made under this paragraph for a fiscal year shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregated payments under this subsection in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made in the year without such adjustment.</p>
