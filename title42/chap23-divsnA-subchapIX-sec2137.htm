<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 96&ndash;395, title III, &sect;307, June 30, 1980, 94 Stat. 791, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Commission is authorized and directed to prepare a plan for improving the technical capability of licensee personnel to safely operate utilization facilities licensed under section 103 or 104b. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [sections 2133 and 2134(b) of this title]. In proposing such plan, the Commission shall consider the feasibility of requiring standard mandatory training programs for nuclear facility operators, including classroom study, apprenticeships at the facility, and emergency simulator training. Such plan shall include specific criteria for more intensive training and retraining of operator personnel licensed under section 107 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [this section], and for the licensing of such personnel, to assure&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) conformity with all conditions and requirements of the operating license;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) early identification of accidents, events, or event sequences which may significantly increase the likelihood of an accident; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) effective response to any such event or sequence.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Such plan shall include provision for Commission review and approval of the qualifications of personnel conducting any required training and retraining program. The plan shall also include requirements for the renewal of operator licenses including, to the extent practicable, requirements that the operator&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(A) has been actively and extensively engaged in the duties listed in such license,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) has discharged such duties safely to the satisfaction of the Commission,</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) is capable of continuing such duties, and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) has participated in a requalification training program.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Such plan shall include criteria for suspending or revoking operator licenses. In addition, the Commission shall also consider the feasibility of requiring such licensed operator to pass a requalification test every six months including&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(ii) emergency simulator exams.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">The Commission shall transmit to the Congress the plan required by this subsection within six months after the date of the enactment of this Act [June 30, 1980], and shall implement as expeditiously as practicable each element thereof not requiring legislative enactment.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is authorized and directed to undertake a study of the feasibility and value of licensing, under section 107 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [this section], plant managers of utilization facilities and senior licensee officers responsible for operation of such facilities. The Commission shall report to the Congress within six months of the date of enactment of this Act [June 30, 1980] on the findings and recommendations of the study required by this subsection, and shall expeditiously implement each such recommendation not requiring legislative enactment.&rdquo;</p>
