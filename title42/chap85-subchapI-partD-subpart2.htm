<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Classification and attainment dates for 1989 nonattainment areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each area designated nonattainment for ozone pursuant to section 7407(d) of this title shall be classified at the time of such designation, under table 1, by operation of law, as a Marginal Area, a Moderate Area, a Serious Area, a Severe Area, or an Extreme Area based on the design value for the area. The design value shall be calculated according to the interpretation methodology issued by the Administrator most recently before November 15, 1990. For each area classified under this subsection, the primary standard attainment date for ozone shall be as expeditiously as practicable but not later than the date provided in table 1.</p>

</table>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding table 1, in the case of a severe area with a 1988 ozone design value between 0.190 and 0.280 ppm, the attainment date shall be 17 years (in lieu of 15 years) after November 15, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the time of publication of the notice under section 7407(d)(4) of this title (relating to area designations) for each ozone nonattainment area, the Administrator shall publish a notice announcing the classification of such ozone nonattainment area. The provisions of section 7502(a)(1)(B) of this title (relating to lack of notice and comment and judicial review) shall apply to such classification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an area classified under paragraph (1) (Table 1) would have been classified in another category if the design value in the area were 5 percent greater or 5 percent less than the level on which such classification was based, the Administrator may, in the Administrator's discretion, within 90 days after the initial classification, by the procedure required under paragraph (3), adjust the classification to place the area in such other category. In making such adjustment, the Administrator may consider the number of exceedances of the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone in the area, the level of pollution transport between the area and other affected areas, including both intrastate and interstate transport, and the mix of sources and air pollutants in the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Upon application by any State, the Administrator may extend for 1 additional year (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Extension Year&rdquo;) the date specified in table 1 of paragraph (1) of this subsection if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State has complied with all requirements and commitments pertaining to the area in the applicable implementation plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) no more than 1 exceedance of the national ambient air quality standard level for ozone has occurred in the area in the year preceding the Extension Year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No more than 2 one-year extensions may be issued under this paragraph for a single nonattainment area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) New designations and reclassifications</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) New designations to nonattainment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any area that is designated attainment or unclassifiable for ozone under section 7407(d)(4) of this title, and that is subsequently <!-- PDFPage:5471 -->redesignated to nonattainment for ozone under section 7407(d)(3) of this title, shall, at the time of the redesignation, be classified by operation of law in accordance with table 1 under subsection (a) of this section. Upon its classification, the area shall be subject to the same requirements under section 7410 of this title, subpart 1 of this part, and this subpart that would have applied had the area been so classified at the time of the notice under subsection (a)(3) of this section, except that any absolute, fixed date applicable in connection with any such requirement is extended by operation of law by a period equal to the length of time between November 15, 1990, and the date the area is classified under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reclassification upon failure to attain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Within 6 months following the applicable attainment date (including any extension thereof) for an ozone nonattainment area, the Administrator shall determine, based on the area's design value (as of the attainment date), whether the area attained the standard by that date. Except for any Severe or Extreme area, any area that the Administrator finds has not attained the standard by that date shall be reclassified by operation of law in accordance with table 1 of subsection (a) of this section to the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the next higher classification for the area, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the classification applicable to the area's design value as determined at the time of the notice required under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No area shall be reclassified as Extreme under clause (ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register, no later than 6 months following the attainment date, identifying each area that the Administrator has determined under subparagraph (A) as having failed to attain and identifying the reclassification, if any, described under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Voluntary reclassification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall grant the request of any State to reclassify a nonattainment area in that State in accordance with table 1 of subsection (a) of this section to a higher classification. The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register of any such request and of action by the Administrator granting the request.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure of Severe Areas to attain standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If any Severe Area fails to achieve the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone by the applicable attainment date (including any extension thereof), the fee provisions under section 7511d of this title shall apply within the area, the percent reduction requirements of section 7511a(c)(2)(B) and (C) of this title (relating to reasonable further progress demonstration and NO<sub>x</sub> control) shall continue to apply to the area, and the State shall demonstrate that such percent reduction has been achieved in each 3-year interval after such failure until the standard is attained. Any failure to make such a demonstration shall be subject to the sanctions provided under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (A), if the ozone design value for a Severe Area referred to in subparagraph (A) is above 0.140 ppm for the year of the applicable attainment date, or if the area has failed to achieve its most recent milestone under section 7511a(g) of this title, the new source review requirements applicable under this subpart in Extreme Areas shall apply in the area and the term&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7511_1_target" name="7511_1">1</a></sup> &ldquo;major source&rdquo; and &ldquo;major stationary source&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as in Extreme Areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In addition to the requirements of subparagraph (A) for those areas referred to in subparagraph (A) and not covered by subparagraph (B), the provisions referred to in subparagraph (B) shall apply after 3 years from the applicable attainment date unless the area has attained the standard by the end of such 3-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If, after November 15, 1990, the Administrator modifies the method of determining compliance with the national primary ambient air quality standard, a design value or other indicator comparable to 0.140 in terms of its relationship to the standard shall be used in lieu of 0.140 for purposes of applying the provisions of subparagraphs (B) and (C).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) References to terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any reference in this subpart to a &ldquo;Marginal Area&rdquo;, a &ldquo;Moderate Area&rdquo;, a &ldquo;Serious Area&rdquo;, a &ldquo;Severe Area&rdquo;, or an &ldquo;Extreme Area&rdquo; shall be considered a reference to a Marginal Area, a Moderate Area, a Serious Area, a Severe Area, or an Extreme Area as respectively classified under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any reference in this subpart to &ldquo;next higher classification&rdquo; or comparable terms shall be considered a reference to the classification related to the next higher set of design values in table 1.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Provisions to correct requirements in (or add requirements to) the plan concerning permit programs as were required under section 7502(b)(6) of this title (as in effect immediately before November 15, 1990), as interpreted in regulations of the Administrator promulgated as of November 15, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Periodic inventory</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No later than the end of each 3-year period after submission of the inventory under paragraph (1) until the area is redesignated to attainment, the State shall submit a revised inventory meeting the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5473 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Emissions statements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Within 2 years after November 15, 1990, the State shall submit a revision to the State implementation plan to require that the owner or operator of each stationary source of oxides of nitrogen or volatile organic compounds provide the State with a statement, in such form as the Administrator may prescribe (or accept an equivalent alternative developed by the State), for classes or categories of sources, showing the actual emissions of oxides of nitrogen and volatile organic compounds from that source. The first such statement shall be submitted within 3 years after November 15, 1990. Subsequent statements shall be submitted at least every year thereafter. The statement shall contain a certification that the information contained in the statement is accurate to the best knowledge of the individual certifying the statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The State may waive the application of clause (i) to any class or category of stationary sources which emit less than 25 tons per year of volatile organic compounds or oxides of nitrogen if the State, in its submissions under subparagraphs&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7511a_1_target" name="7511a_1">1</a></sup> (1) or (3)(A), provides an inventory of emissions from such class or category of sources, based on the use of the emission factors established by the Administrator or other methods acceptable to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) General offset requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of satisfying the emission offset requirements of this part, the ratio of total emission reductions of volatile organic compounds to total increased emissions of such air pollutant shall be at least 1.1 to 1.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Administrator may, in the Administrator's discretion, require States to submit a schedule for submitting any of the revisions or other items required under this subsection. The requirements of this subsection shall apply in lieu of any requirement that the State submit a demonstration that the applicable implementation plan provides for attainment of the ozone standard by the applicable attainment date in any Marginal Area. Section 7502(c)(9) of this title (relating to contingency measures) shall not apply to Marginal Areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Moderate Areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State in which all or part of a Moderate Area is located shall, with respect to the Moderate Area, make the submissions described under subsection (a) of this section (relating to Marginal Areas), and shall also submit the revisions to the applicable implementation plan described under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Plan provisions for reasonable further progress</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) By no later than 3 years after November 15, 1990, the State shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan to provide for volatile organic compound emission reductions, within 6 years after November 15, 1990, of at least 15 percent from baseline emissions, accounting for any growth in emissions after 1990. Such plan shall provide for such specific annual reductions in emissions of volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen as necessary to attain the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone by the attainment date applicable under this chapter. This subparagraph shall not apply in the case of oxides of nitrogen for those areas for which the Administrator determines (when the Administrator approves the plan or plan revision) that additional reductions of oxides of nitrogen would not contribute to attainment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A percentage less than 15 percent may be used for purposes of clause (i) in the case of any State which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Administrator that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) new source review provisions are applicable in the nonattainment areas in the same manner and to the same extent as required under subsection (e) of this section in the case of Extreme Areas (with the exception that, in applying such provisions, the terms &ldquo;major source&rdquo; and &ldquo;major stationary source&rdquo; shall include (in addition to the sources described in section 7602 of this title) any stationary source or group of sources located within a contiguous area and under common control that emits, or has the potential to emit, at least 5 tons per year of volatile organic compounds);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) reasonably available control technology is required for all existing major sources (as defined in subclause (I)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) the plan reflecting a lesser percentage than 15 percent includes all measures that can feasibly be implemented in the area, in light of technological achievability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">To qualify for a lesser percentage under this clause, a State must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the plan for the area includes the measures that are achieved in practice by sources in the same source category in nonattainment areas of the next higher category.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Baseline emissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the term &ldquo;baseline emissions&rdquo; means the total amount of actual VOC or NO<sub>x</sub> emissions from all anthropogenic sources in the area during the calendar year 1990, excluding emissions that would be eliminated under the regulations described in clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) General rule for creditability of reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided under subparagraph (D), emissions reductions are creditable toward the 15 percent required under subparagraph (A) to the extent they have actually occurred, as of 6 years after November 15, 1990, from the implementation of measures required under the applicable implementation plan, rules promulgated by the Administrator, or a permit under subchapter V of this chapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5474 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limits on creditability of reductions</h4>

The Administrator shall grant or deny such petition within 6 months after its filing with the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Milestones</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Reductions in emissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">6 years after November 15, 1990, and at intervals of every 3 years thereafter, the State shall determine whether each nonattainment area (other than an area classified as Marginal or Moderate) has achieved a reduction in emissions during the preceding intervals equivalent to the total emission reductions required to be achieved by the end of such interval pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section and the corresponding requirements of subsections (c)(2)(B) and (C), (d), and (e) of this section. Such reduction shall be referred to in this section as an applicable milestone.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance demonstration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each nonattainment area referred to in paragraph (1), not later than 90 days after the date on which an applicable milestone occurs (not including an attainment date on which a milestone occurs in cases where the standard has been attained), each State in which all or part of such area is located shall submit to the Administrator a demonstration that the milestone has been met. A demonstration under this paragraph shall be submitted in such form and manner, and shall contain such information and analysis, as the Administrator shall require, by rule. The Administrator shall determine whether or not a State's demonstration is adequate within 90 days after the Administrator's receipt of a demonstration which contains the information and analysis required by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Serious and Severe Areas; State election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State fails to submit a demonstration under paragraph (2) for any Serious or Severe Area within the required period or if the Administrator determines that the area has not met any applicable milestone, the State shall elect, within 90 days after such failure or determination&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to have the area reclassified to the next higher classification,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to implement specific additional measures adequate, as determined by the Administrator, to meet the next milestone as provided in the applicable contingency plan, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to adopt an economic incentive program as described in paragraph (4).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If the State makes an election under subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall, within 90 days after the election, review such plan and shall, if the Administrator finds the contingency plan inadequate, require further measures necessary to meet such milestone. Once the State makes an election, it shall be deemed accepted by the Administrator as meeting the election requirement. If the State fails to make an election required under this paragraph within the required 90-day period or within 6 months thereafter, the area shall be reclassified to the next higher classification by operation of law at the expiration of such 6-month period. Within 12 months after the date required for the State to make an election, the State shall submit a revision of the applicable implementation plan for the area that meets the requirements of this paragraph. The Administrator shall review such plan revision and approve or disapprove the revision within 9 months after the date of its submission.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Economic incentive program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An economic incentive program under this paragraph shall be consistent with rules published by the Administrator and sufficient, in combination with other elements of the State plan, to achieve the next milestone. The State program may include a nondiscriminatory system, consistent with applicable law regarding interstate commerce, of State established emissions fees or a system of marketable permits, or a system of State fees on sale or manufacture of products the use of which contributes to ozone formation, or any combination of the foregoing or other similar measures. The program may also include incentives and requirements to reduce vehicle emissions and vehicle miles traveled in the area, including any of the transportation control measures identified in section 7408(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Within 2 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall publish rules for the programs to be adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A). Such rules shall include model plan provisions which may be adopted for reducing emissions from permitted stationary sources, area sources, and mobile sources. The guidelines shall require that any revenues generated by the plan provisions adopted pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be used by the State for any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Providing incentives for achieving emission reductions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) Providing assistance for the development of innovative technologies for the control of ozone air pollution and for the development of lower-polluting solvents and surface coatings. Such assistance shall not provide for the payment of more than 75 percent of either the costs of any project to develop such a technology or the costs of development of a lower-polluting solvent or surface coating.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) Funding the administrative costs of State programs under this chapter. Not more than 50 percent of such revenues may be used for purposes of this clause.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Extreme Areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State fails to submit a demonstration under paragraph (2) for any Extreme Area <!-- PDFPage:5481 -->within the required period, or if the Administrator determines that the area has not met any applicable milestone, the State shall, within 9 months after such failure or determination, submit a plan revision to implement an economic incentive program which meets the requirements of paragraph (4). The Administrator shall review such plan revision and approve or disapprove the revision within 9 months after the date of its submission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Rural transport areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of section 7511 of this title or this section, a State containing an ozone nonattainment area that does not include, and is not adjacent to, any part of a Metropolitan Statistical Area or, where one exists, a Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area (as defined by the United States Bureau of the Census), which area is treated by the Administrator, in the Administrator's discretion, as a rural transport area within the meaning of paragraph (2), shall be treated by operation of law as satisfying the requirements of this section if it makes the submissions required under subsection (a) of this section (relating to marginal areas).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may treat an ozone nonattainment area as a rural transport area if the Administrator finds that sources of VOC (and, where the Administrator determines relevant, NO<sub>x</sub>) emissions within the area do not make a significant contribution to the ozone concentrations measured in the area or in other areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Reclassified areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State containing an ozone nonattainment area reclassified under section 7511(b)(2) of this title shall meet such requirements of subsections (b) through (d) of this section as may be applicable to the area as reclassified, according to the schedules prescribed in connection with such requirements, except that the Administrator may adjust any applicable deadlines (other than attainment dates) to the extent such adjustment is necessary or appropriate to assure consistency among the required submissions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Multi-State ozone nonattainment areas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Coordination among States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State in which there is located a portion of a single ozone nonattainment area which covers more than one State (hereinafter in this section referred to as a &ldquo;multi-State ozone nonattainment area&rdquo;) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take all reasonable steps to coordinate, substantively and procedurally, the revisions and implementation of State implementation plans applicable to the nonattainment area concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) use photochemical grid modeling or any other analytical method determined by the Administrator, in his discretion, to be at least as effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Administrator may not approve any revision of a State implementation plan submitted under this part for a State in which part of a multi-State ozone nonattainment area is located if the plan revision for that State fails to comply with the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Failure to demonstrate attainment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any State in which there is located a portion of a multi-State ozone nonattainment area fails to provide a demonstration of attainment of the national ambient air quality standard for ozone in that portion within the required period, the State may petition the Administrator to make a finding that the State would have been able to make such demonstration but for the failure of one or more other States in which other portions of the area are located to commit to the implementation of all measures required under this section (relating to plan submissions and requirements for ozone nonattainment areas). If the Administrator makes such finding, the provisions of section 7509 of this title (relating to sanctions) shall not apply, by reason of the failure to make such demonstration, in the portion of the multi-State ozone nonattainment area within the State submitting such petition.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Control techniques guidelines for VOC sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall issue control techniques guidelines, in accordance with section 7408 of this title, for 11 categories of stationary sources of VOC emissions for which such guidelines have not been issued as of November 15, 1990, not including the categories referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (b) of this section. The Administrator may issue such additional control techniques guidelines as the Administrator deems necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Existing and new CTGS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 36 months after November 15, 1990, and periodically thereafter, the Administrator shall review and, if necessary, update control technique guidance issued under section 7408 of this title before November 15, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In issuing the guidelines the Administrator shall give priority to those categories which the Administrator considers to make the most significant contribution to the formation of ozone air pollution in ozone nonattainment areas, including hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities which are permitted under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.]. Thereafter the Administrator shall periodically review and, if necessary, revise such guidelines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall issue control techniques guidelines in accordance with section 7408 of this title to reduce the aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from aerospace coatings and solvents. Such control techniques guidelines shall, at a minimum, be adequate to reduce aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from the application of such coatings and solvents to such level as the Administrator determines may be achieved through the adoption of best available control measures. Such control technology guidance shall provide for such reductions in such increments and on such schedules as the Administrator determines to be reasonable, but in no event later than 10 years after the final issuance of such control technology guidance. In developing control technology guidance under this subsection, the Administrator shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with regard to the establishment of specifications for such coatings. In evaluating VOC reduction strategies, the guidance shall take into account the applicable requirements of section 7412 of this title and the need to protect stratospheric ozone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall issue control techniques guidelines in accordance with section 7408 of this title to reduce the aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds and PM&ndash;10 into the ambient air from paints, coatings, and solvents used in shipbuilding operations and ship repair. Such control techniques guidelines shall, at a minimum, be adequate to reduce aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds and PM&ndash;10 into the ambient air from the removal or application of such paints, coatings, and solvents to such level as the Administrator determines may be achieved through the adoption of the best available control measures. Such control techniques guidelines shall provide for such reductions in such increments and on such schedules as the Administrator determines to be reasonable, but in no event later than 10 years after the final issuance of such control technology guidance. In developing control techniques guidelines under this subsection, the Administrator shall consult with the appropriate Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Alternative control techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall issue technical documents which identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources of volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen which emit, or have the potential to emit 25 tons per year or more of such air pollutant. The Administrator shall revise and update such documents as the Administrator determines necessary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5483 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guidance for evaluating cost-effectiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall provide guidance to the States to be used in evaluating the relative cost-effectiveness of various options for the control of emissions from existing stationary sources of air pollutants which contribute to nonattainment of the national ambient air quality standards for ozone.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Control of emissions from certain sources</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Best available controls</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;best available controls&rdquo; means the degree of emissions reduction that the Administrator determines, on the basis of technological and economic feasibility, health, environmental, and energy impacts, is achievable through the application of the most effective equipment, measures, processes, methods, systems or techniques, including chemical reformulation, product or feedstock substitution, repackaging, and directions for use, consumption, storage, or disposal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consumer or commercial product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;consumer or commercial product&rdquo; means any substance, product (including paints, coatings, and solvents), or article (including any container or packaging) held by any person, the use, consumption, storage, disposal, destruction, or decomposition of which may result in the release of volatile organic compounds. The term does not include fuels or fuel additives regulated under section 7545 of this title, or motor vehicles, non-road vehicles, and non-road engines as defined under section 7550 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Regulated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;regulated entities&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, or importers of consumer or commercial products for sale or distribution in interstate commerce in the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, or importers that supply the entities listed under clause (i) with such products for sale or distribution in interstate commerce in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Study and report</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall conduct a study of the emissions of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from consumer and commercial products (or any combination thereof) in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determine their potential to contribute to ozone levels which violate the national ambient air quality standard for ozone; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) establish criteria for regulating consumer and commercial products or classes or categories thereof which shall be subject to control under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The study shall be completed and a report submitted to Congress not later than 3 years after November 15, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consideration of certain factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the criteria under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Administrator shall take into consideration each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The uses, benefits, and commercial demand of consumer and commercial products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The health or safety functions (if any) served by such consumer and commercial products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Those consumer and commercial products which emit highly reactive volatile organic compounds into the ambient air.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Those consumer and commercial products which are subject to the most cost-effective controls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) The availability of alternatives (if any) to such consumer and commercial products which are of comparable costs, considering health, safety, and environmental impacts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations to require emission reductions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon submission of the final report under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall list those categories of consumer or commercial products that the Administrator determines, based on the study, account for at least 80 percent of the VOC emissions, on a reactivity-adjusted basis, from consumer or commercial products in areas that violate the NAAQS for ozone. Credit toward the 80 percent emissions calculation shall be given for emission reductions from consumer or commercial products made after November 15, 1990. At such time, the Administrator shall divide the list into 4 groups establishing priorities for regulation based on the criteria established in paragraph (2). Every 2 years after promulgating such list, the Administrator shall regulate one group of categories until all 4 groups are regulated. The regulations shall require best available controls as defined in this section. Such regulations may exempt health use products for which the Administrator determines there is no suitable substitute. In order to carry out this section, the Administrator may, by regulation, control or prohibit any activity, including the manufacture or introduction into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any consumer or commercial product which results in emission of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Regulated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Regulations under this subsection may be imposed only with respect to regulated entities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Use of CTGS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For any consumer or commercial product the Administrator may issue control techniques guidelines under this chapter in lieu of regulations required under subparagraph (A) if the Administrator determines that such guidance will be substantially as effective as regulations in reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds which contrib<!-- PDFPage:5484 -->ute to ozone levels in areas which violate the national ambient air quality standard for ozone.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Systems of regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations under this subsection may include any system or systems of regulation as the Administrator may deem appropriate, including requirements for registration and labeling, self-monitoring and reporting, prohibitions, limitations, or economic incentives (including marketable permits and auctions of emissions rights) concerning the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, consumption, or disposal of the product.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amounts collected by the Administrator under such regulations shall be deposited in a special fund in the United States Treasury for licensing and other services, which thereafter shall be available until expended, subject to annual appropriation Acts, solely to carry out the activities of the Administrator for which such fees, charges, or collections are established or made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any regulation established under this subsection shall be treated, for purposes of enforcement of this chapter, as a standard under section 7411 of this title and any violation of such regulation shall be treated as a violation of a requirement of section 7411(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) State administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State may develop and submit to the Administrator a procedure under State law for implementing and enforcing regulations promulgated under this subsection. If the Administrator finds the State procedure is adequate, the Administrator shall approve such procedure. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit the Administrator from enforcing any applicable regulations under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Size, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No regulations regarding the size, shape, or labeling of a product may be promulgated, unless the Administrator determines such regulations to be useful in meeting any national ambient air quality standard.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) State consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any State which proposes regulations other than those adopted under this subsection shall consult with the Administrator regarding whether any other State or local subdivision has promulgated or is promulgating regulations on any products covered under this part. The Administrator shall establish a clearinghouse of information, studies, and regulations proposed and promulgated regarding products covered under this subsection and disseminate such information collected as requested by State or local subdivisions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Tank vessel standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Schedule for standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Within 2 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall promulgate standards applicable to the emission of VOCs and any other air pollutant from loading and unloading of tank vessels (as that term is defined in section 2101 of title 46) which the Administrator finds causes, or contributes to, air pollution that may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Such standards shall require the application of reasonably available control technology, considering costs, any nonair-quality benefits, environmental impacts, energy requirements and safety factors associated with alternative control techniques. To the extent practicable such standards shall apply to loading and unloading facilities and not to tank vessels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any regulation prescribed under this subsection (and any revision thereof) shall take effect after such period as the Administrator finds (after consultation with the Secretary of the department&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7511b_1_target" name="7511b_1">1</a></sup> in which the Coast Guard is operating) necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period, except that the effective date shall not be more than 2 years after promulgation of such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations on equipment safety</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after November 15, 1990, the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall issue regulations to ensure the safety of the equipment and operations which are to control emissions from the loading and unloading of tank vessels, under section 3703 of title 46 and section 1225 of title 33. The standards promulgated by the Administrator under paragraph (1) and the regulations issued by a State or political subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and unloading of tank vessels shall be consistent with the regulations regarding safety of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Agency authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Administrator shall ensure compliance with the tank vessel emission standards prescribed under paragraph (1)(A). The Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall also ensure compliance with the tank vessel standards prescribed under paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall ensure compliance with the regulations issued under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) State or local standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the Administrator promulgates standards under this section, no State or political subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any standard respecting emissions from tank vessels subject to regulation under paragraph (1) unless such standard is no less stringent than the standards promulgated under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any standard established under paragraph (1)(A) shall be treated, for purposes of enforce<!-- PDFPage:5485 -->ment of this chapter, as a standard under section 7411 of this title and any violation of such standard shall be treated as a violation of a requirement of section 7411(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Ozone design value study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall conduct a study of whether the methodology in use by the Environmental Protection Agency as of November 15, 1990, for establishing a design value for ozone provides a reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality of ozone nonattainment areas. The Administrator shall obtain input from States, local subdivisions thereof, and others. The study shall be completed and a report submitted to Congress not later than 3 years after November 15, 1990. The results of the study shall be subject to peer and public review before submitting it to Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Vehicles entering ozone nonattainment areas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority regarding ozone inspection and maintenance testing</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No noncommercial motor vehicle registered in a foreign country and operated by a United States citizen or by an alien who is a permanent resident of the United States, or who holds a visa for the purposes of employment or educational study in the United States, may enter a covered ozone nonattainment area from a foreign country bordering the United States and contiguous to the nonattainment area more than twice in a single calendar-month period, if State law has requirements for the inspection and maintenance of such vehicles under the applicable implementation plan in the nonattainment area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) shall not apply if the operator presents documentation at the United States border entry point establishing that the vehicle has complied with such inspection and maintenance requirements as are in effect and are applicable to motor vehicles of the same type and model year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sanctions for violations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Ozone transport regions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A single transport region for ozone (within the meaning of section 7506a(a) of this title), com<!-- PDFPage:5486 -->prised of the States of Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the Consolidated Metropolitan Statistical Area that includes the District of Columbia, is hereby established by operation of law. The provisions of section 7506a(a)(1) and (2) of this title shall apply with respect to the transport region established under this section and any other transport region established for ozone, except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this section. The Administrator shall convene the commission required (under section 7506a(b) of this title) as a result of the establishment of such region within 6 months of November 15, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Plan provisions for States in ozone transport regions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In accordance with section 7410 of this title, not later than 2 years after November 15, 1990 (or 9 months after the subsequent inclusion of a State in a transport region established for ozone), each State included within a transport region established for ozone shall submit a State implementation plan or revision thereof to the Administrator which requires the following&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that each area in such State that is in an ozone transport region, and that is a metropolitan statistical area or part thereof with a population of 100,000 or more comply with the provisions of section 7511a(c)(2)(A) of this title (pertaining to enhanced vehicle inspection and maintenance programs); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) implementation of reasonably available control technology with respect to all sources of volatile organic compounds in the State covered by a control techniques guideline issued before or after November 15, 1990.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall complete a study identifying control measures capable of achieving emission reductions comparable to those achievable through vehicle refueling controls contained in section 7511a(b)(3) of this title, and such measures or such vehicle refueling controls shall be implemented in accordance with the provisions of this section. Notwithstanding other deadlines in this section, the applicable implementation plan shall be revised to reflect such measures within 1 year of completion of the study. For purposes of this section any stationary source that emits or has the potential to emit at least 50 tons per year of volatile organic compounds shall be considered a major stationary source and subject to the requirements which would be applicable to major stationary sources if the area were classified as a Moderate nonattainment area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Additional control measures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon petition of any State within a transport region established for ozone, and based on a majority vote of the Governors on the Commission&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7511c_1_target" name="7511c_1">1</a></sup> (or their designees), the Commission&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7511c_1_target" name="7511c_1">1</a></sup> may, after notice and opportunity for public comment, develop recommendations for additional control measures to be applied within all or a part of such transport region if the commission determines such measures are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart. The commission shall transmit such recommendations to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice and review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Administrator receives recommendations prepared by a commission pursuant to paragraph (1) (the date of receipt of which shall hereinafter in this section be referred to as the &ldquo;receipt date&rdquo;), the Administrator shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) immediately publish in the Federal Register a notice stating that the recommendations are available and provide an opportunity for public hearing within 90 days beginning on the receipt date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) commence a review of the recommendations to determine whether the control measures in the recommendations are necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart and are otherwise consistent with this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In undertaking the review required under paragraph (2)(B), the Administrator shall consult with members of the commission of the affected States and shall take into account the data, views, and comments received pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Approval and disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 9 months after the receipt date, the Administrator shall (A) determine whether to approve, disapprove, or partially disapprove and partially approve the recommendations; (B) notify the commission in writing of such approval, disapproval, or partial disapproval; and (C) publish such determination in the Federal Register. If the Administrator disapproves or partially disapproves the recommendations, the Administrator shall specify&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) why any disapproved additional control measures are not necessary to bring any area in such region into attainment by the dates provided by this subpart or are otherwise not consistent with the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7511c_2_target" name="7511c_2">2</a></sup> chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) recommendations concerning equal or more effective actions that could be taken by the commission to conform the disapproved portion of the recommendations to the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Finding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon approval or partial approval of recommendations submitted by a commission, the Administrator shall issue to each State which is included in the transport region and to which a requirement of the approved plan applies, a finding under section 7410(k)(5) of this title that the implementation plan for such State is inadequate to meet the requirements of section 7410(a)(2)(D) of this title. Such finding shall require each such State to revise its implementation plan to include the approved additional control measures within one year after the finding is issued.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5487 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Best available air quality monitoring and modeling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, not later than 6 months after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall promulgate criteria for purposes of determining the contribution of sources in one area to concentrations of ozone in another area which is a nonattainment area for ozone. Such criteria shall require that the best available air quality monitoring and modeling techniques be used for purposes of making such determinations.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each implementation plan revision required under section 7511a(d) and (e) of this title (relating to the attainment plan for Severe and Extreme ozone nonattainment areas) shall provide that, if the area to which such plan revision applies has failed to attain the national primary ambient air quality standard for ozone by the applicable attainment date, each major stationary source of VOCs located in the area shall, except as otherwise provided under subsection (c) of this section, pay a fee to the State as a penalty for such failure, computed in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, for each calendar year beginning after the attainment date, until the area is redesignated as an attainment area for ozone. Each such plan revision should include procedures for assessment and collection of such fees.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of fee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Fee amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The fee shall equal $5,000, adjusted in accordance with paragraph (3), per ton of VOC emitted by the source during the calendar year in excess of 80 percent of the baseline amount, computed under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Baseline amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the baseline amount shall be computed, in accordance with such guidance as the Administrator may provide, as the lower of the amount of actual VOC emissions (&ldquo;actuals&rdquo;) or VOC emissions allowed under the permit applicable to the source (or, if no such permit has been issued for the attainment year, the amount of VOC emissions allowed under the applicable implementation plan (&ldquo;allowables&rdquo;)) during the attainment year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Administrator may issue guidance authorizing the baseline amount to be determined in accordance with the lower of average actuals or average allowables, determined over a period of more than one calendar year. Such guidance may provide that such average calculation for a specific source may be used if that source's emissions are irregular, cyclical, or otherwise vary significantly from year to year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The fee amount under paragraph (1) shall be adjusted annually, beginning in the year beginning after 1990, in accordance with section 7661a(b)(3)(B)(v) of this title (relating to inflation adjustment).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of this section, no source shall be required to pay any fee under subsection (a) of this section with respect to emissions during any year that is treated as an Extension Year under section 7511(a)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fee collection by Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator has found that the fee provisions of the implementation plan do not meet the requirements of this section, or if the Administrator makes a finding that the State is not administering and enforcing the fee required under this section, the Administrator shall, in addition to any other action authorized under this subchapter, collect, in accordance with procedures promulgated by the Administrator, the unpaid fees required under subsection (a) of this section. If the Administrator makes such a finding under section 7509(a)(4) of this title, the Administrator may collect fees for periods before the determination, plus interest computed in accordance with section 6621(a)(2) of title 26 (relating to computation of interest on underpayment of Federal taxes), to the extent the Administrator finds such fees have not been paid to the State. The provisions of clauses (ii) through (iii) of section 7661a(b)(3)(C) of this title (relating to penalties and use of the funds, respectively) shall apply with respect to fees collected under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exemptions for certain small areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For areas with a total population under 200,000 which fail to attain the standard by the applicable attainment date, no sanction under this section or under any other provision of this chapter shall apply if the area can demonstrate, consistent with guidance issued by the Administrator, that attainment in the area is prevented because of ozone or ozone precursors transported from other areas. The prohibition applies only in cases in which the area has met all requirements and implemented all measures applicable to the area under this chapter.</p>
