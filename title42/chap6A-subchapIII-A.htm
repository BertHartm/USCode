<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;310, div. B, title XXXVI, &sect;3662, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1241, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The illegal importation of 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine, commonly referred to as &lsquo;MDMA&rsquo; or &lsquo;Ecstasy&rsquo; (referred to in this subtitle [subtitle C (&sect;&sect;3661&ndash;3665) of title XXXVI of div. B of Pub. L. 106&ndash;310, see section 3661 of Pub. L. 106&ndash;310, set out as a Short Title of 2000 Amendment note under section 201 of this title] as &lsquo;Ecstasy&rsquo;), has increased in recent years, as evidenced by the fact that Ecstasy seizures by the United States Customs Service have increased from less than 500,000 tablets during fiscal year 1997 to more than 9,000,000 tablets during the first 9 months of fiscal year 2000.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Use of Ecstasy can cause long-lasting, and perhaps permanent, damage to the serotonin system of the brain, which is fundamental to the integration of information and emotion, and this damage can cause long-term problems with learning and memory.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Due to the popularity and marketability of Ecstasy, there are numerous Internet websites with information on the effects of Ecstasy, the production of Ecstasy, and the locations of Ecstasy use (often referred to as &lsquo;raves&rsquo;). The availability of this information targets the primary users of Ecstasy, who are most often college students, young professionals, and other young people from middle- to high-income families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Greater emphasis needs to be placed on&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) penalties associated with the manufacture, distribution, and use of Ecstasy;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the education of young people on the negative health effects of Ecstasy, since the reputation of Ecstasy as a &lsquo;safe&rsquo; drug is the most dangerous component of Ecstasy;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the education of State and local law enforcement agencies regarding the growing problem of Ecstasy trafficking across the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) reducing the number of deaths caused by Ecstasy use and the combined use of Ecstasy with other &lsquo;club&rsquo; drugs and alcohol; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) adequate funding for research by the National Institute on Drug Abuse to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) identify those most vulnerable to using Ecstasy and develop science-based prevention approaches tailored to the specific needs of individuals at high risk;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) understand how Ecstasy produces its toxic effects and how to reverse neurotoxic damage;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) develop treatments, including new medications and behavioral treatment approaches;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iv) better understand the effects that Ecstasy has on the developing children and adolescents; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(v) translate research findings into useful tools and ensure their effective dissemination.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants to certain public entities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Center for Mental Health Services, shall make grants to public entities for the purpose of providing comprehensive community mental health services to children with a serious emotional disturbance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) &ldquo;Public entity&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;public entity&rdquo; means any State, any political subdivision of a State, and any Indian tribe or tribal organization (as defined in section 450b(b) and section 450b(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#290ff_1_target" name="290ff_1">1</a></sup> of title 25).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Considerations in making grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement of status as grantee under part B of subchapter XVII</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) of this section to a public entity only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a public entity that is a State, the State is a grantee under section 300x of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a public entity that is a political subdivision of a State, the State in which the political subdivision is located is such a grantee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of a public entity that is an Indian tribe or tribal organization, the State in which the tribe or tribal organization is located is such a grantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirement of status as medicaid provider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), the Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) of this section only if, in the case of any service under such subsection that is covered in the State plan approved under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] for the State involved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the public entity involved will provide the service directly, and the entity has entered into a participation agreement under the State plan and is qualified to receive payments under such plan; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the public entity will enter into an agreement with an organization under which the organization will provide the service, and the organization has entered into such a participation agreement and is qualified to receive such payments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) In the case of an organization making an agreement under subparagraph (A)(ii) regarding the provision of services under subsection (a) of this section, the requirement established in such subparagraph regarding a participation agreement shall be waived by the Secretary if the organization does not, in providing health or mental health services, impose a charge or accept reimbursement available from any third-party payor, including reimbursement under any insurance policy or under any Federal or State health benefits program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) A determination by the Secretary of whether an organization referred to in clause (i) meets the criteria for a waiver under such clause shall be made without regard to whether the organization accepts voluntary donations regarding the provision of services to the public.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making grants under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) equitably allocate such assistance among the principal geographic regions of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consider the extent to which the public entity involved has a need for the grant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of any public entity that is a political subdivision of a State or that is an Indian tribe or tribal organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall consider any comments regarding the application of the entity for such a grant that are received by the Secretary from the State in which the entity is located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall give special consideration to the entity if the State agrees to provide a portion of the non-Federal contributions <!-- PDFPage:535 -->required in subsection (c) of this section regarding such a grant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Matching funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A funding agreement for a grant under subsection (a) of this section is that the public entity involved will, with respect to the costs to be incurred by the entity in carrying out the purpose described in such subsection, make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for the first fiscal year for which the entity receives payments from a grant under such subsection, is not less than $1 for each $3 of Federal funds provided in the grant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for any second or third such fiscal year, is not less than $1 for each $3 of Federal funds provided in the grant;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a drug or medication that is used as a restraint to control behavior or restrict the resident's freedom of movement that is not a standard treatment for the resident's medical or psychiatric condition.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;290kk&ndash;1. Religious organizations as program participants</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a religious organization, on the same basis as any other nonprofit private provider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may receive financial assistance under a designated program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may be a provider of services under a designated program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Religious organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to allow religious organizations to be program participants on the same basis as any other nonprofit private provider without impairing the religious character of such organizations, and without diminishing the religious freedom of program beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nondiscrimination against religious organizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligibility as program participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Religious organizations are eligible to be program participants on the same basis as any other nonprofit private organization as long as the programs are implemented consistent with the Establishment Clause and Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment to the United States Constitution. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict the ability of the Federal Government, or a State or local government receiving funds under such programs, to apply to religious organizations the same eligibility conditions in designated programs as are applied to any other nonprofit private organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nondiscrimination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither the Federal Government nor a State or local government receiving funds under designated programs shall discriminate against an organization that is or applies to be a program participant on the basis that the organization has a religious character.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Religious character and freedom</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Religious organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in this section, any religious organization that is a program participant shall retain its independence from Federal, State, and local government, including such organization's control over the definition, development, practice, and expression of its religious beliefs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:546 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional safeguards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither the Federal Government nor a State shall require a religious organization to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">in order to be a program participant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Employment practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify or affect the provisions of any other Federal or State law or regulation that relates to discrimination in employment. A religious organization's exemption provided under section 2000e&ndash;1 of this title regarding employment practices shall not be affected by its participation in, or receipt of funds from, a designated program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Rights of program beneficiaries</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual who is a program beneficiary or a prospective program beneficiary objects to the religious character of a program participant, within a reasonable period of time after the date of such objection such program participant shall refer such individual to, and the appropriate Federal, State, or local government that administers a designated program or is a program participant shall provide to such individual (if otherwise eligible for such services), program services that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are from an alternative provider that is accessible to, and has the capacity to provide such services to, such individual; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have a value that is not less than the value of the services that the individual would have received from the program participant to which the individual had such objection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Upon referring a program beneficiary to an alternative provider, the program participant shall notify the appropriate Federal, State, or local government agency that administers the program of such referral.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Program participants, public agencies that refer individuals to designated programs, and the appropriate Federal, State, or local governments that administer designated programs or are program participants shall ensure that notice is provided to program beneficiaries or prospective program beneficiaries of their rights under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Additional requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A program participant making a referral pursuant to paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prior to making such referral, consider any list that the State or local government makes available of entities in the geographic area that provide program services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ensure that the individual makes contact with the alternative provider to which the individual is referred.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Nondiscrimination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A religious organization that is a program participant shall not in providing program services or engaging in outreach activities under designated programs discriminate against a program beneficiary or prospective program beneficiary on the basis of religion or religious belief.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Fiscal accountability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limited audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to the award involved, a religious organization that is a program participant shall segregate Federal amounts provided under award into a separate account from non-Federal funds. Only the award funds shall be subject to audit by the government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to compliance with this section by an agency, a religious organization may obtain judicial review of agency action in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5.</p>
