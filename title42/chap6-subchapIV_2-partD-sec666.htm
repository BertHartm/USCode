<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of procedures required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to satisfy section 654(20)(A) of this title, each State must have in effect laws requiring the use of the following procedures, consistent with this section and with regulations of the Secretary, to increase the effectiveness of the program which the State administers under this part:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Procedures described in subsection (b) of this section for the withholding from income of amounts payable as support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Procedures under which expedited processes (determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary) are in effect under the State judicial system or under State administrative processes (A) for obtaining and enforcing support orders, and (B) for establishing paternity. The Secretary may waive the provisions of this paragraph with respect to one or more political subdivisions within the State on the basis of the effectiveness and timeliness of support order issuance and enforcement or paternity establishment within the political subdivision (in accordance with the general rule for exemptions under subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Procedures under which the State child support enforcement agency shall request, and the State shall provide, that for the purpose of enforcing a support order under any State plan approved under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any refund of State income tax which would otherwise be payable to an absent parent will be reduced, after notice has been sent to that absent parent of the proposed reduction and the procedures to be followed to contest it (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State), by the amount of any overdue support owed by such absent parent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount by which such refund is reduced shall be distributed in accordance with section 657(b)(4) or (d)(3) of this title in the case of overdue support assigned to a State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) or 671(a)(17) of this title, or, in the case of overdue support which a State has agreed to collect under section 654(6) of this title, shall be distributed, after deduction of any fees imposed by the State to cover the costs of collection, to the child or parent to whom such support is owed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notice of the absent parent's social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) and home address shall be furnished to the State agency requesting the refund offset, and to the State agency enforcing the order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Procedures under which liens are imposed against real and personal property for amounts of overdue support owed by an absent parent who resides or owns property in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A)(i) Procedures which permit the establishment of the paternity of any child at any time prior to such child's eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) As of August 16, 1984, the requirement of clause (i) shall also apply to any child for whom paternity has not yet been established and any child for whom a paternity action was brought but dismissed because a statute of limitations of less than 18 years was then in effect in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures under which the State is required (except in cases where the individual involved has been found under section 602(a)(26)(B) of this title to have good cause for refusing to cooperate) to require the child and all other parties, in a contested paternity case, to submit to genetic tests upon the request of any such party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Procedures for a simple civil process for voluntarily acknowledging paternity under which the State must provide that the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging paternity are explained and ensure that due process safeguards are afforded. Such procedures must include a hospital-based program for the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity during the period immediately before or after the birth of a child.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1269 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity creates a rebuttable, or at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity, and under which such voluntary acknowledgment is admissible as evidence of paternity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity must be recognized as a basis for seeking a support order without requiring any further proceedings to establish paternity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Procedures which provide that (i) any objection to genetic testing results must be made in writing within a specified number of days before any hearing at which such results may be introduced into evidence, and (ii) if no objection is made, the test results are admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Procedures which create a rebuttable or, at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity upon genetic testing results indicating a threshold probability that the alleged father is the father of the child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Procedures requiring a default order to be entered in a paternity case upon a showing of service of process on the defendent&nbsp;<sup><a href="#666_1_target" name="666_1">1</a></sup> and any additional showing required by State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Procedures which require that an absent parent give security, post a bond, or give some other guarantee to secure payment of overdue support, after notice has been sent to such absent parent of the proposed action and of the procedures to be followed to contest it (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Procedures which require the State to periodically report to consumer reporting agencies (as defined in section 1681a(f) of title 15) the name of any parent who owes overdue support and is at least 2 months delinquent in the payment of such support and the amount of such delinquency; except that (A) if the amount of the overdue support involved in any case is less than $1,000, information regarding such amount shall be made available only at the option of the State, (B) any information with respect to an absent parent shall be made available under such procedures only after notice has been sent to such absent parent of the proposed action, and such absent parent has been given a reasonable opportunity to contest the accuracy of such information (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State), and (C) such information shall not be made available to (i) a consumer reporting agency which the State determines does not have sufficient capability to systematically and timely make accurate use of such information, or (ii) an entity which has not furnished evidence satisfactory to the State that the entity is a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8)(A) Procedures under which all child support orders not described in subparagraph (B) will include provision for withholding from wages, in order to assure that withholding as a means of collecting child support is available if arrearages occur without the necessity of filing application for services under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures under which all child support orders which are initially issued in the State on or after January 1, 1994, and are not being enforced under this part will include the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The wages of an absent parent shall be subject to withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, on the effective date of the order; except that such wages shall not be subject to withholding under this clause in any case where (I) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court (or administrative process) finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or (II) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section (which shall apply in the case of each absent parent against whom a support order is or has been issued or modified in the State, without regard to whether the order is being enforced under the State plan).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (2), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), and (10) of subsection (b) of this section, where applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Withholding from income of amounts payable as support must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Procedures which require that any payment or installment of support under any child support order, whether ordered through the State judicial system or through the expedited processes required by paragraph (2), is (on and after the date it is due)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of the State, including the ability to be enforced,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in such State and in any other State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not subject to retroactive modification by such State or by any other State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that such procedures may permit modification with respect to any period during which there is pending a petition for modification, but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee or (where the obligee is the petitioner) to the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10)(A) Procedures to ensure that, beginning 2 years after October 13, 1988, if the State determines (pursuant to a plan indicating how and when child support orders in effect in the State are to be periodically reviewed and adjusted) that a child support order being enforced under this part should be reviewed, the State must, at the request of either parent subject to the order, or of a State child support enforcement agency, initiate a review of such order, and adjust such order, as appropriate, in accordance with the guidelines es<!-- PDFPage:1270 -->tablished pursuant to section 667(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures to ensure that, beginning 5 years after October 13, 1988, or such earlier date as the State may select, the State must implement a process for the periodic review and adjustment of child support orders being enforced under this part under which the order is to be reviewed not later than 36 months after the establishment of the order or the most recent review, and adjusted, as appropriate, in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to section 667(a) of this title, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of an order with respect to an individual with respect to whom an assignment under section 602(a)(26) of this title is in effect, the State has determined, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, that such a review would not be in the best interests of the child and neither parent has requested review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of any other order being enforced under this part, neither parent has requested review.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Procedures to ensure that the State notifies each parent subject to a child support order in effect in the State that is being enforced under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) of any review of such order, at least 30 days before the commencement of such review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) of the right of such parent under subparagraph (B) to request the State to review such order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) of a proposed adjustment (or determination that there should be no change) in the child support award amount, and such parent is afforded not less than 30 days after such notification to initiate proceedings to challenge such adjustment (or determination).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Procedures under which a State must give full faith and credit to a determination of paternity made by any other State, whether established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative or judicial processes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding section 654(20)(B) of this title, the procedures which are required under paragraphs (3), (4), (6), and (7) need not be used or applied in cases where the State determines (using guidelines which are generally available within the State and which take into account the payment record of the absent parent, the availability of other remedies, and other relevant considerations) that such use or application would not carry out the purposes of this part or would be otherwise inappropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Withholding from income of amounts payable as support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procedures referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section (relating to the withholding from income of amounts payable as support) must provide for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of each absent parent against whom a support order is or has been issued or modified in the State, and is being enforced under the State plan, so much of such parent's wages (as defined by the State for purposes of this section) must be withheld, in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this subsection, as is necessary to comply with the order and provide for the payment of any fee to the employer which may be required under paragraph (6)(A), up to the maximum amount permitted under section 1673(b) of title 15. If there are arrearages to be collected, amounts withheld to satisfy such arrearages, when added to the amounts withheld to pay current support and provide for the fee, may not exceed the limit permitted under such section 1673(b), but the State need not withhold up to the maximum amount permitted under such section in order to satisfy arrearages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such withholding must be provided without the necessity of any application therefor in the case of a child (whether or not eligible for aid under part A of this subchapter) with respect to whom services are already being provided under the State plan under this part, and must be provided in accordance with this subsection on the basis of an application for services under the State plan in the case of any other child in whose behalf a support order has been issued or modified in the State. In either case such withholding must occur without the need for any amendment to the support order involved or for any further action (other than those actions required under this part) by the court or other entity which issued such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The wages of an absent parent shall be subject to such withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, in the case of a support order being enforced under this part that is issued or modified on or after the first day of the 25th month beginning after October 13, 1988, on the effective date of the order; except that such wages shall not be subject to such withholding under this subparagraph in any case where (i) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court (or administrative process) finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or (ii) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The wages of an absent parent shall become subject to such withholding, in the case of wages not subject to withholding under subparagraph (A), on the date on which the payments which the absent parent has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the date as of which the absent parent requests that such withholding begin,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the date as of which the custodial parent requests that such withholding begin, if the State determines, in accordance with such procedures and standards as it may establish, that the request should be approved, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) such earlier date as the State may select.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Such withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State, and (sub<!-- PDFPage:1271 -->ject to subparagraph (B)) the State must send advance notice to each absent parent to whom paragraph (1) applies regarding the proposed withholding and the procedures such absent parent should follow if he or she desires to contest such withholding on the grounds that withholding (including the amount to be withheld) is not proper in the case involved because of mistakes of fact. If the absent parent contests such withholding on those grounds, the State shall determine whether such withholding will actually occur, shall (within no more than 45 days after the provision of such advance notice) inform such parent of whether or not withholding will occur and (if so) of the date on which it is to begin, and shall furnish such parent with the information contained in any notice given to the employer under paragraph (6)(A) with respect to such withholding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The requirement of advance notice set forth in the first sentence of subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of any State which has a system of income withholding for child support purposes in effect on August 16, 1984, if such system provides on that date, and continues to provide, such procedures as may be necessary to meet the procedural due process requirements of State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Such withholding must be administered by a public agency designated by the State, and the amounts withheld must be expeditiously distributed by the State or such agency in accordance with section 657 of this title under procedures (specified by the State) adequate to document payments of support and to track and monitor such payments, except that the State may establish or permit the establishment of alternative procedures for the collection and distribution of such amounts (under the supervision of such public agency) otherwise than through such public agency so long as the entity making such collection and distribution is publicly accountable for its actions taken in carrying out such procedures, and so long as such procedures will assure prompt distribution, provide for the keeping of adequate records to document payments of support, and permit the tracking and monitoring of such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A)(i) The employer of any absent parent to whom paragraph (1) applies, upon being given notice as described in clause (ii), must be required to withhold from such absent parent's wages the amount specified by such notice (which may include a fee, established by the State, to be paid to the employer unless waived by such employer) and pay such amount (after deducting and retaining any portion thereof which represents the fee so established) to the appropriate agency (or other entity authorized to collect the amounts withheld under the alternative procedures described in paragraph (5)) for distribution in accordance with section 657 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The notice given to the employer shall contain only such information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Methods must be established by the State to simplify the withholding process for employers to the greatest extent possible, including permitting any employer to combine all withheld amounts into a single payment to each appropriate agency or entity (with the portion thereof which is attributable to each individual employee being separately designated).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The employer must be held liable to the State for any amount which such employer fails to withhold from wages due an employee following receipt by such employer of proper notice under subparagraph (A), but such employer shall not be required to vary the normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Provision must be made for the imposition of a fine against any employer who discharges from employment, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against any absent parent subject to wage withholding required by this subsection because of the existence of such withholding and the obligations or additional obligations which it imposes upon the employer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Support collection under this subsection must be given priority over any other legal process under State law against the same wages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The State may take such actions as may be necessary to extend its system of withholding under this subsection so that such system will include withholding from forms of income other than wages, in order to assure that child support owed by absent parents in the State will be collected without regard to the types of such absent parents&rsquo; income or the nature of their income-producing activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The State must extend its withholding system under this subsection so that such system will include withholding from income derived within such State in cases where the applicable support orders were issued in other States, in order to assure that child support owed by absent parents in such State or any other State will be collected without regard to the residence of the child for whom the support is payable or of such child's custodial parent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Provision must be made for terminating withholding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administration of support payments through State agency or other entity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State may at its option, under its plan approved under section 654 of this title, establish procedures under which support payments under this part will be made through the State agency or other entity which administers the State's income withholding system in any case where either the absent parent or the custodial parent requests it, even though no arrearages in child support payments are involved and no income withholding procedures have been instituted; but in any such case an annual fee for handling and processing such payments, in an amount not exceeding the actual costs incurred by the State in connection therewith or $25, whichever is less, shall be imposed on the requesting parent by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exemption of States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary, through the presentation to the <!-- PDFPage:1272 -->Secretary of such data pertaining to caseloads, processing times, administrative costs, and average support collections, and such other data or estimates as the Secretary may specify, that the enactment of any law or the use of any procedure or procedures required by or pursuant to this section will not increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the State child support enforcement program, the Secretary may exempt the State, subject to the Secretary's continuing review and to termination of the exemption should circumstances change, from the requirement to enact the law or use the procedure or procedures involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Overdue support&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;overdue support&rdquo; means the amount of a delinquency pursuant to an obligation determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative process established under State law, for support and maintenance of a minor child which is owed to or on behalf of such child, or for support and maintenance of the absent parent's spouse (or former spouse) with whom the child is living if and to the extent that spousal support (with respect to such spouse or former spouse) would be included for purposes of paragraph (4) or (6) of section 654 of this title. At the option of the State, overdue support may include amounts which otherwise meet the definition in the first sentence of this subsection but which are owed to or on behalf of a child who is not a minor child. The option to include support owed to children who are not minors shall apply independently to each procedure specified under this section.</p>
