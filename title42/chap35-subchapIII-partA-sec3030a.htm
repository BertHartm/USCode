<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), in the case of a grantee that has an application approved under subchapter X of this chapter for a fiscal year but that did not receive assistance under this section for the preceding fiscal year, the number of meals served by the title VI [subchapter X] grantee for the preceding fiscal year shall be deemed to equal the number of meals that the Assistant Secretary estimates will be served by the title VI [subchapter X] grantee in the fiscal year for which the application was approved.</p>
