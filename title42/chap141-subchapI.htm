<h3 class="section-head">&sect;14711. Commercialization of Space Station</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a priority goal of constructing the International Space Station is the economic development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further declares that free and competitive markets create the most efficient conditions for promoting economic development, and should therefore govern the economic development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further declares that the use of free market principles in operating, servicing, allocating the use of, and adding capabilities to the Space Station, and the resulting fullest possible engagement of commercial providers and participation of commercial users, will reduce Space Station operational costs for all partners and the Federal Government's share of the United States burden to fund operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within 90 days after October 28, 1998, a study that identifies and examines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the opportunities for commercial providers to play a role in International Space Station activities, including operation, use, servicing, and augmentation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the potential cost savings to be derived from commercial providers playing a role in each of these activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) which of the opportunities described in subparagraph (A) the Administrator plans to make available to commercial providers in fiscal years 1999 and 2000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the specific policies and initiatives the Administrator is advancing to encourage and facilitate these commercial opportunities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the revenues and cost reimbursements to the Federal Government from commercial users of the Space Station.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within 180 days after October 28, 1998, an independently conducted market study that examines and evaluates potential industry interest in providing commercial goods and services for the operation, servicing, and augmentation of the International Space Station, and in the commercial use of the International Space Station. This study shall also include updates to the cost savings and revenue estimates made in the study described in paragraph (1) based on the external market assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall deliver to the Congress, no later than the submission of the President's annual budget request for fiscal year 2000, a report detailing how many proposals (whether solicited or not) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration received during calendar years 1997 and 1998 regarding commercial operation, servicing, utilization, or augmentation of the International Space Station, broken down by each of these four categories, and specifying how many agreements the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has entered into in response to these proposals, also broken down by these four categories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each of the studies and reports required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall include consideration of the potential role of State governments as brokers in promoting commercial participation in the International Space Station program.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;14712. Promotion of United States Global Positioning System standards</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Finding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the Global Positioning System, including satellites, signal equipment, ground stations, data links, and associated command and control facilities, has become an essential element in civil, scientific, and military space development because of the emergence of a United States commercial industry which provides Global Positioning System equipment and related services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) International cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to support and sustain the Global Positioning System in a manner that will most effectively contribute to the national security, public safety, scientific, and economic interests of the United States, the Congress encourages the President to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensure the operation of the Global Positioning System on a continuous worldwide basis free of direct user fees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) enter into international agreements that promote cooperation with foreign governments and international organizations to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish the Global Positioning System and its augmentations as an acceptable international standard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) eliminate any foreign barriers to applications of the Global Positioning System worldwide; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide clear direction and adequate resources to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information so that on an international basis the Assistant Secretary can&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) achieve and sustain efficient management of the electromagnetic spectrum used by the Global Positioning System; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) protect that spectrum from disruption and interference.</p>
