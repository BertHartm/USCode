<h3 class="section-head">&sect;14711. Commercialization of Space Station</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a priority goal of constructing the International Space Station is the economic development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further declares that free and competitive markets create the most efficient conditions for promoting economic development, and should therefore govern the economic development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further declares that the use of free market principles in operating, servicing, allocating the use of, and adding capabilities to the Space Station, and the resulting fullest possible engagement of commercial providers and participation of commercial users, will reduce Space Station operational costs for all partners and the Federal Government's share of the United States burden to fund operations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within 90 days after October 28, 1998, a study that identifies and examines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the opportunities for commercial providers to play a role in International Space Station activities, including operation, use, servicing, and augmentation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the potential cost savings to be derived from commercial providers playing a role in each of these activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) which of the opportunities described in subparagraph (A) the Administrator plans to make available to commercial providers in fiscal years 1999 and 2000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the specific policies and initiatives the Administrator is advancing to encourage and facilitate these commercial opportunities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the revenues and cost reimbursements to the Federal Government from commercial users of the Space Station.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within 180 days after October 28, 1998, an independently conducted market study that examines and evaluates potential industry interest in providing commercial goods and services for the operation, servicing, and augmentation of the International Space Station, and in the commercial use of the International Space Station. This study shall also include updates to the cost savings and revenue estimates made in the study described in paragraph (1) based on the external market assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall deliver to the Congress, no later than the submission of the President's annual budget request for fiscal year 2000, a report detailing how many proposals (whether solicited or not) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration received during calendar years 1997 and 1998 regarding commercial operation, servicing, utilization, or augmentation of the International Space Station, broken down by each of these four categories, and specifying how many agreements the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has entered into in response to these proposals, also broken down by these four categories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each of the studies and reports required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall include consideration of the potential role of State governments as brokers in promoting commercial participation in the International Space Station program.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of this section is to establish a demonstration regarding the commercial feasibility and economic viability of private sector business operations involving the International Space Station and its related infrastructure. The goal will be furthered by the early use of the International Space Station by United States commercial entities committing private capital to commercial enterprises on the International Space Station. In conjunction with this demonstration program, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) shall establish and publish a price policy designed to eliminate price uncertainty for those planning to utilize the International Space Station and its related facilities for United States commercial use.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Receipts for Commercial Use</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any receipts collected by NASA from the commercial use of the International Space Station shall first be used to offset any costs incurred by NASA in support of the United States commercial use of the International Space Station. Any receipts collected in excess of the costs identified pursuant to the prior sentence may be retained by NASA for use without fiscal year limitation in promoting the commercial use of the International Space Station.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6996 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;NASA shall submit an annual report to the Congress that identifies all receipts that are collected under this section, the use of the receipts and the status of the demonstration. NASA shall submit a final report on the status of the demonstration, including any recommendation for expansion, within 120 days of the completion of the assembly of the International Space Station or the end of fiscal year 2002, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Definitions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As used in this section, the term &lsquo;United States commercial use&rsquo; means private commercial projects that are designed to benefit the United States through the sales of goods or services or the creation of jobs, or both.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Termination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The demonstration program established under this section shall apply to United States commercial use agreements that are entered into prior to the date of the completion of the International Space Station or the end of fiscal year 2002, whichever is earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the Global Positioning System, including satellites, signal equipment, ground stations, data links, and associated command and control facilities, has become an essential element in civil, scientific, and military space development because of the emergence of a United States commercial industry which provides Global Positioning System equipment and related services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) International cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to support and sustain the Global Positioning System in a manner that will most effectively contribute to the national security, public safety, scientific, and economic interests of the United States, the Congress encourages the President to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensure the operation of the Global Positioning System on a continuous worldwide basis free of direct user fees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) enter into international agreements that promote cooperation with foreign governments and international organizations to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish the Global Positioning System and its augmentations as an acceptable international standard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) eliminate any foreign barriers to applications of the Global Positioning System worldwide; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide clear direction and adequate resources to the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications and Information so that on an international basis the Assistant Secretary can&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) achieve and sustain efficient management of the electromagnetic spectrum used by the Global Positioning System; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) protect that spectrum from disruption and interference.</p>
