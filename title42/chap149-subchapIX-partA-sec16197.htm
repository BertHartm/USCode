<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 18 months after May 8, 2008, the Secretary shall make grants to nonprofit institutions, State and local governments, cooperative extension services, or institutions of higher education (or consortia thereof), to establish a geographically dispersed network of Advanced Energy Technology Transfer Centers, to be located in areas the Secretary determines have the greatest need of the services of such Centers. In making awards under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) give priority to applicants already operating or partnered with an outreach program capable of transferring knowledge and information about advanced energy efficiency methods and technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) ensure that, to the extent practicable, the program enables the transfer of knowledge and information&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) about a variety of technologies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in a variety of geographic areas;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) give preference to applicants that would significantly expand on or fill a gap in existing programs in a geographical region; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the special needs and opportunities for increased energy efficiency for manufactured and site-built housing, including construction, renovation, and retrofit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Center shall operate a program to encourage demonstration and commercial application of advanced energy methods and technologies through education and outreach to building and industrial professionals, and to other individuals and organizations with an interest in efficient energy use. Funds awarded under this section may be used for the following activities:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Developing and distributing informational materials on technologies that could use energy more efficiently.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Carrying out demonstrations of advanced energy methods and technologies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Developing and conducting seminars, workshops, long-distance learning sessions, and other activities to aid in the dissemination of knowledge and information on technologies that could use energy more efficiently.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Providing or coordinating onsite energy evaluations, including instruction on the commissioning of building heating and cooling systems, for a wide range of energy end-users.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Examining the energy efficiency needs of energy end-users to develop recommended research projects for the Department.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Hiring experts in energy efficient technologies to carry out activities described in paragraphs (1) through (5).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a description of the applicant's outreach program, and the geographic region it would serve, and of why the program would be capable of transferring knowledge and information about advanced energy technologies that increase efficiency of energy use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of the activities the applicant would carry out, of the technologies that would be transferred, and of any other organizations that will help facilitate a regional approach to carrying out those activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a description of how the proposed activities would be appropriate to the specific energy needs of the geographic region to be served;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an estimate of the number and types of energy end-users expected to be reached through such activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a description of how the applicant will assess the success of the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Selection criteria</h4>
