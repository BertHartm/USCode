<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a refusal to permit, at the expense of the handicapped person, reasonable modifications of existing premises occupied or to be occupied by such person if such modifications may be necessary to afford such person full enjoyment of the premises except that, in the case of a rental, the landlord may where it is reasonable to do so condition permission for a modification on the renter agreeing to restore the interior of the premises to the condition that existed before the modification, reasonable wear and tear excepted.<sup><a href="#3604_2_target" name="3604_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(D) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to require the Secretary to review or approve the plans, designs or construction of all covered multifamily dwellings, to determine whether the design and construction of such dwellings are consistent with the requirements of paragraph 3(C).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) ground floor units in other buildings consisting of 4 or more units.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to invalidate or limit any law of a State <!-- PDFPage:4224 -->or political subdivision of a State, or other jurisdiction in which this subchapter shall be effective, that requires dwellings to be designed and constructed in a manner that affords handicapped persons greater access than is required by this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) Nothing in this subsection requires that a dwelling be made available to an individual whose tenancy would constitute a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or whose tenancy would result in substantial physical damage to the property of others.</p>
