Within 18 months after October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall produce and make available an information package for consumers to assist them in choosing among alternative fuels and alternative fueled vehicles. Such information package shall provide relevant and objective information on motor vehicle characteristics and fuel characteristics as compared to gasoline, on a life cycle basis, including environmental performance, energy efficiency, domestic content, cost, maintenance requirements, reliability, and safety. Such information package shall also include information with respect to the conversion of conventional motor vehicles to alternative fueled vehicles. The Secretary shall include such other information as the Secretary determines is reasonable and necessary to help promote the use of alternative fuels in motor vehicles. Such information package shall be updated annually to reflect the most recent available information.</p>

Required labeling under the rule shall be simple and, where appropriate, consolidated with other labels providing information to the consumer. In formulating the rule, the Federal Trade Commission shall give consideration to the problems associated with developing and publishing useful and timely cost and benefit information, taking into account lead time, costs, the frequency of changes in costs and benefits that may occur, and other relevant factors. The Commission shall obtain the views of affected industries, consumer organizations, Federal and State agencies, and others in formulating the rule.
