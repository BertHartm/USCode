<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Average monthly rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the participation rate for all families of a State for a fiscal year is the average of the participation rates for all families of the State for each month in the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Monthly participation rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The participation rate of a State for all families of the State for a month, expressed as a percentage, is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the number of families receiving assistance under the State program funded under this part that include an adult or a minor child head of household who is engaged in work for the month; divided by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the number of families receiving such assistance during the month that include an adult or a minor child head of household receiving such assistance; exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the number of families receiving such assistance that are subject in such month to a penalty described in subsection (e)(1) of this section but have not been subject to such penalty for more than 3 months within the preceding 12-month period (whether or not consecutive).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 2-parent families</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Average monthly rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, the participation rate for 2-parent families of a State for a fiscal year is the average of the participation rates for 2-parent families of the State for each month in the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Monthly participation rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The participation rate of a State for 2-parent families of the State for a month shall be calculated by use of the formula set forth in paragraph (1)(B), except that in the formula the term &ldquo;number of 2-parent families&rdquo; shall be substituted for the term &ldquo;number of families&rdquo; each place such latter term appears.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Family with a disabled parent not treated as a 2-parent family</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A family that includes a disabled parent shall not be considered a 2-parent family for purposes of subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Pro rata reduction of participation rate due to caseload reductions not required by Federal law and not resulting from changes in State eligibility criteria</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations for reducing the minimum participation rate <!-- PDFPage:1413 -->otherwise required by this section for a fiscal year by the number of percentage points equal to the number of percentage points (if any) by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the average monthly number of families receiving assistance during the immediately preceding fiscal year under the State program funded under this part is less than</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the average monthly number of families that received aid under the State plan approved under part A of this subchapter (as in effect on September 30, 1995) during fiscal year 1995.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The minimum participation rate shall not be reduced to the extent that the Secretary determines that the reduction in the number of families receiving such assistance is required by Federal law.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Eligibility changes not counted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The regulations required by subparagraph (A) shall not take into account families that are diverted from a State program funded under this part as a result of differences in eligibility criteria under a State program funded under this part and eligibility criteria under the State program operated under the State plan approved under part A of this subchapter (as such plan and such part were in effect on September 30, 1995). Such regulations shall place the burden on the Secretary to prove that such families were diverted as a direct result of differences in such eligibility criteria.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) State option to include individuals receiving assistance under a tribal family assistance plan or tribal work program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B), a State may, at its option, include families in the State that are receiving assistance under a tribal family assistance plan approved under section 612 of this title or under a tribal work program to which funds are provided under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) State option for participation requirement exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For any fiscal year, a State may, at its option, not require an individual who is a single custodial parent caring for a child who has not attained 12 months of age to engage in work, and may disregard such an individual in determining the participation rates under subsection (a) of this section for not more than 12 months.</p>
