<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the Bureau of Justice Assistance (hereinafter in this subchapter referred to as the &ldquo;Bureau&rdquo;) determines, under regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, that a public safety officer has died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay a benefit of $100,000, adjusted in accordance with subsection (h) of this section, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if there is no surviving child of such officer, to the surviving spouse of such officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if there is a surviving child or children and a surviving spouse, one-half to the surviving child or children of such officer in equal shares and one-half to the surviving spouse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if there is no surviving spouse, to the child or children of such officer in equal shares; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Benefits for permanent and total disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In accordance with regulations issued pursuant to this subchapter, in any case in which the Bureau determines that a public safety officer has become permanently and totally disabled as the direct result of a catastrophic injury sustained in the line of duty, the Bureau shall pay, to the extent that appropriations are provided, the same benefit in any year that is payable under subsection (a) of this section in such year, adjusted in accordance with subsection (h) of this section, to such officer: <em>Provided</em>, That the total annual benefits paid under this subsection may not exceed $5,000,000. For the purposes of making these benefit payments, there are authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year such sums as may be necessary: <em>Provided further</em>, That these benefit payments are subject to the availability of appropriations and that each beneficiary's payment shall be reduced by a proportionate share to the extent that sufficient funds are not appropriated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interim benefit payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Bureau determines upon showing of need and prior to final action that the death of a public safety officer is one with respect to which a benefit will probably be paid, the Bureau may make an interim benefit payment not exceeding $3,000 to the individual entitled to receive a benefit under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deduction of interim payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of an interim payment under subsection (c) of this section shall be deducted from the amount of any final benefit paid to such individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Repayment of interim payment; waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where there is no final benefit paid, the recipient of any interim payment under subsection (c) of this section shall be liable for repayment of such amount. The Bureau may waive all or part of such repayment, considering for this purpose the hardship which would result from such repayment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reductions from final benefit payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The benefit payable under this subchapter shall be in addition to any other benefit that may be due from any other source, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) payments authorized by section 12(k) of the Act of September 1, 1916, as amended (D.C. Code, sec. 4&ndash;622); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) benefits authorized by section 8191 of title 5. Such beneficiaries shall only receive benefits under such section 8191 that are in excess of the benefits received under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Execution or attachment prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No benefit paid under this subchapter shall be subject to execution or attachment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Consumer Price Index adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On October 1 of each fiscal year beginning after June 1, 1988, the Bureau shall adjust the level of the benefit payable immediately before such October 1 under subsection (a) of this section, to reflect the annual percentage change in the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers, published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, occurring in the 1-year period ending on June 1 immediately preceding such October 1.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Amount payable determined as of date of death</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount payable under subsection (a) of this section with respect to the death of a public safety officer shall be the amount payable under subsection (a) of this section as of the date of death of such officer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Limitations on benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the death of a public safety officer if a benefit is paid under this subchapter with respect to the disability of such officer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the disability of a public safety officer if a benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the death of such public safety officer.</p>
