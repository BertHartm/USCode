<p class="statutory-body">Any cash payments which are made by a State (or political subdivision thereof) on a regular basis to individuals who are receiving benefits under this subchapter or who would but for their income be eligible to receive benefits under this subchapter, as assistance based on need in supplementation of such benefits (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security), shall be excluded under section 1382a(b)(6) of this title in determining the income of such individuals for purposes of this subchapter and the Commissioner of Social Security and such State may enter into an agreement which satisfies subsection (b) of this section under which the Commissioner of Social Security will, on behalf of such State (or subdivision) make such supplementary payments to all such individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Agreement between Commissioner and State; contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any agreement between the Commissioner of Social Security and a State entered into under subsection (a) of this section shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that such payments will be made (subject to subsection (c) of this section) to all individuals residing in such State (or subdivision) who are receiving benefits under this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such other rules with respect to eligibility for or amount of the supplementary payments, and such procedural or other general administrative provisions, as the Commissioner of Social Security finds necessary (subject to subsection (c) of this section) to achieve efficient and effective administration of both the program which the Commissioner conducts under this subchapter and the optional State supplementation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">At the option of the State (but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection), the agreement between the Commissioner of Social Security and such State entered into under subsection (a) of this section shall be modified to provide that the Commissioner of Social Security will make supplementary payments, on and after an effective date to be specified in the agreement as so modified, to individuals receiving benefits determined under section 1382(e)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Residence requirement by State or subdivision for supplementary payments; disregarding amounts of certain income by State or subdivision in determining eligibility for supplementary payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any State (or political subdivision) making supplementary payments described in subsection (a) of this section may at its option impose as a condition of eligibility for such payments, and include in the State's agreement with the Commissioner of Social Security under such subsection, a residence requirement which excludes individuals who have resided in the State (or political subdivision) for less than a minimum period prior to application for such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any State (or political subdivision), in determining the eligibility of any individual for supplementary payments described in subsection (a) of this section, may disregard amounts of earned and unearned income in addition to other amounts which it is required or permitted to disregard under this section in determining such eligibility, and shall include a provision specifying the amount of any such income that will be disregarded, if any.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any State (or political subdivision) making supplementary payments described in sub<!-- PDFPage:2303 -->section (a) of this section shall have the option of making such payments to individuals who receive benefits under this subchapter under the provisions of section 1382h of this title, or who would be eligible to receive such benefits but for their income.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment to Commissioner by State of amount equal to expenditures by Commissioner as supplementary payments; time and manner of payment by State; fees for Federal administration of State supplementary payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any State which has entered into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Security under this section which provides that the Commissioner of Social Security will, on behalf of the State (or political subdivision), make the supplementary payments to individuals who are receiving benefits under this subchapter (or who would but for their income be eligible to receive such benefits), shall, in accordance with paragraph (5), pay to the Commissioner of Social Security an amount equal to the expenditures made by the Commissioner of Social Security as such supplementary payments, plus an administration fee assessed in accordance with paragraph (2) and any additional services fee charged in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Commissioner of Social Security shall assess each State an administration fee in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the number of supplementary payments made by the Commissioner of Social Security on behalf of the State under this section for any month in a fiscal year; multiplied by</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(x) for fiscal year 2003 and each succeeding fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the applicable rate in the preceding fiscal year, increased by the percentage, if any, by which the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year of the increase exceeds the Consumer Price Index for the month of June of the calendar year preceding the calendar year of the increase, and rounded to the nearest whole cent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) such different rate as the Commissioner determines is appropriate for the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Upon making a determination under subparagraph (B)(x)(II), the Commissioner of Social Security shall promulgate the determination in regulations, which may take into account the complexity of administering the State's supplementary payment program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) All fees assessed pursuant to this paragraph shall be transferred to the Commissioner of Social Security at the same time that amounts for such supplementary payments are required to be so transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Commissioner of Social Security may charge a State an additional services fee if, at the request of the State, the Commissioner of Social Security provides additional services beyond the level customarily provided, in the administration of State supplementary payments pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The additional services fee shall be in an amount that the Commissioner of Social Security determines is necessary to cover all costs (including indirect costs) incurred by the Federal Government in furnishing the additional services referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The first $5 of each administration fee assessed pursuant to paragraph (2), upon collection, shall be deposited in the general fund of the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) That portion of each administration fee in excess of $5, and 100 percent of each additional services fee charged pursuant to paragraph (3), upon collection for fiscal year 1998 and each subsequent fiscal year, shall be credited to a special fund established in the Treasury of the United States for State supplementary payment fees. The amounts so credited, to the extent and in the amounts provided in advance in appropriations Acts, shall be available to defray expenses incurred in carrying out this subchapter and related laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A)(i) Any State which has entered into an agreement with the Commissioner of Social Security under this section shall remit the payments and fees required under this subsection with respect to monthly benefits paid to individuals under this subchapter no later than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the business day preceding the date that the Commissioner pays such monthly benefits; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) with respect to such monthly benefits paid for the month that is the last month of the State's fiscal year, the fifth business day following such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Commissioner may charge States a penalty in an amount equal to 5 percent of the payment and the fees due if the remittance is received after the date required by clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Cash Management Improvement Act of 1990 shall not apply to any payments or fees required under this subsection that are paid by a State before the date required by subparagraph (A)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A)(i), the Commissioner may make supplementary payments on behalf of a State with funds appropriated for payment of benefits under this subchapter, and subsequently to be reimbursed for such payments by the State at such times as the Commissioner and State may agree. Such authority may be exercised only if extraordinary circumstances affecting a State's ability to make payment when required by subparagraph (A)(i) are determined by the Commissioner to exist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State standards; establishment; annual public review; annual certification; payments to individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each State shall establish or designate one or more State or local authorities which shall establish, maintain, and insure the enforcement <!-- PDFPage:2304 -->of standards for any category of institutions, foster homes, or group living arrangements in which (as determined by the State) a significant number of recipients of supplemental security income benefits is residing or is likely to reside. Such standards shall be appropriate to the needs of such recipients and the character of the facilities involved, and shall govern such matters as admission policies, safety, sanitation, and protection of civil rights.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each State shall annually make available for public review a summary of the standards established pursuant to paragraph (1), and shall make available to any interested individual a copy of such standards, along with the procedures available in the State to insure the enforcement of such standards and a list of any waivers of such standards and any violations of such standards which have come to the attention of the authority responsible for their enforcement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each State shall certify annually to the Commissioner of Social Security that it is in compliance with the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Payments made under this subchapter with respect to an individual shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount of any supplementary payment (as described in subsection (a) of this section) or other payment made by a State (or political subdivision thereof) which is made for or on account of any medical or any other type of remedial care provided by an institution of the type described in paragraph (1) to such individual as a resident or an inpatient of such institution if such institution is not approved as meeting the standards described in such paragraph by the appropriate State or local authorities.</p>
