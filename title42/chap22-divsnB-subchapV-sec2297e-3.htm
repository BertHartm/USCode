Such incorporators shall take whatever actions are necessary or appropriate to establish the private corporation, including the filing of articles of incorporation in such jurisdiction as the incorporators determine to be appropriate. The incorporators shall also develop a plan for the issuance by the private corporation of voting common stock to the public, which plan shall be subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.</p>
