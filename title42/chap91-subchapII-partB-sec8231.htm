The Secretary shall make assistance available under this section on a priority basis to those projects which are in financial difficulty as a result of high energy costs. In carrying out the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall issue regulations requiring that any grant made under this section shall be made only on the condition that the recipient of such grant shall take steps (prescribed by the Secretary) to assure that the benefits derived from such grants in terms of lower energy costs shall accure&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8231_2_target" name="8231_2">2</a></sup> to tenants in the form of lower rentals or to the Federal Government in the form of a lower operating subsidy if such a subsidy is being paid to such recipient.</p>
