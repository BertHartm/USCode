<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Financing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The application shall identify and describe the proposed financing for (A) any rehabilitation, and (B) acquisition (i) of the project, where applicable, by an entity for transfer to eligible families, and (ii) by eligible families of ownership interests in, or shares representing, units in the project.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Opportunity to cure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any lender that provides financing in connection with a homeownership program under this part shall give the public housing agency, resident management corporation, individual owner, or other appropriate entity a reasonable opportunity to cure a financial default before foreclosing on the property, or taking other action as a result of the default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Housing quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The application shall include a plan ensuring that the unit&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rental assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a tenant decides not to purchase a unit, or is not qualified to do so, the Secretary shall, subject to the availability of appropriations, ensure that rental assistance under section 1437f of this title is available for use by each otherwise qualified tenant in that or another property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relocation assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The recipient shall also inform each such tenant that if the tenant chooses to move, the recipient will pay relocation assistance in accordance with the approved homeownership program.</p>
