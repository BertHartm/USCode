<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a Medicare+Choice organization from providing supplemental benefits (described in section 1395w&ndash;22(a)(3) of this title) that are in addition to the health care benefits otherwise required to be provided under this paragraph and from imposing a premium for such supplemental benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stabilization fund</h4>

Any of such value of the amount reserved which is not provided as additional benefits described in paragraph (1)(A) to individuals electing the Medicare+Choice plan of the organization in accordance with such paragraph prior to the end of such periods, shall revert for the use of such trust funds.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such portion of the weighted aggregate premium, which the Secretary annually estimates would apply to such an individual, as the Secretary annually estimates is attributable to that service or services,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but adjusted for differences between the utilization characteristics of the individuals electing coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the other enrollees with the plan (or, if the Secretary finds that adequate data are not available to adjust for those differences, the differences between the utilization characteristics of individuals selecting other Medicare+Choice coverage, or Medicare+Choice eligible individuals in the area, in the State, or in the United States, eligible to elect Medicare+Choice coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the rest of the population in the area, in the State, or in the United States, respectively).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination based on insufficient data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if the Secretary finds that there is insufficient enrollment experience to determine an average of the capitation payments to be made under this part at the beginning of a contract period or to determine (in the case of a newly operated <!-- PDFPage:2018 -->provider-sponsored organization or other new organization) the adjusted community rate for the organization, the Secretary may determine such an average based on the enrollment experience of other contracts entered into under this part and may determine such a rate using data in the general commercial marketplace.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prohibition of State imposition of premium taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State may impose a premium tax or similar tax with respect to payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under section 1395w&ndash;23 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Permitting use of segments of service areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall permit a Medicare+Choice organization to elect to apply the provisions of this section uniformly to separate segments of a service area (rather than uniformly to an entire service area) as long as such segments are composed of one or more Medicare+Choice payment areas.</p>
