<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each Medicare+Choice organization (in relation to a Medicare+Choice plan, other than an MSA plan, it offers) shall provide that if there is an excess amount (as defined in subparagraph (B)) for the plan for a contract year, subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the organization shall provide to individuals such additional benefits (as the organization may specify) in a value which the Secretary determines is at least equal to the adjusted excess amount (as defined in subparagraph (C)).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Uniform application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall be applied uniformly for all enrollees for a plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a Medicare+Choice organization from providing supplemental benefits (described in section 1395w&ndash;22(a)(3) of this title) that are in addition to the health care benefits otherwise required to be provided under this paragraph and from imposing a premium for such supplemental benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stabilization fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Medicare+Choice organization may provide that a part of the value of an excess amount described in paragraph (1) be withheld and reserved in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and in the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (in such proportions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate) by the Secretary for subsequent annual contract periods, to the extent required to stabilize and prevent undue fluctuations in the additional benefits offered in those subsequent periods by the organization in accordance with such paragraph. Any of such value of the amount reserved which is not provided as additional benefits described in paragraph (1)(A) to individuals electing the Medicare+Choice plan of the organization in accordance with such paragraph prior to the end of such periods, shall revert for the use of such trust funds.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such portion of the weighted aggregate premium, which the Secretary annually estimates would apply to such an individual, as the Secretary annually estimates is attributable to that service or services,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1922 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but adjusted for differences between the utilization characteristics of the individuals electing coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the other enrollees with the plan (or, if the Secretary finds that adequate data are not available to adjust for those differences, the differences between the utilization characteristics of individuals selecting other Medicare+Choice coverage, or Medicare+Choice eligible individuals in the area, in the State, or in the United States, eligible to elect Medicare+Choice coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the rest of the population in the area, in the State, or in the United States, respectively).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination based on insufficient data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if the Secretary finds that there is insufficient enrollment experience to determine an average of the capitation payments to be made under this part at the beginning of a contract period or to determine (in the case of a newly operated provider-sponsored organization or other new organization) the adjusted community rate for the organization, the Secretary may determine such an average based on the enrollment experience of other contracts entered into under this part and may determine such a rate using data in the general commercial marketplace.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prohibition of State imposition of premium taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State may impose a premium tax or similar tax with respect to payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under section 1395w&ndash;23 of this title.</p>
