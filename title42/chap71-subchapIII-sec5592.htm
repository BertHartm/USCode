<p class="statutory-body">(2) The projected costs of commercial production and maintenance of the photovoltaic systems utilized in the testing and demonstration programs established under this subchapter should be taken into account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Encouragement should be given in the conduct of programs under this subchapter to those projects in which funds are appropriated by any State or political subdivision thereof for the purpose of sharing costs with the Federal Government for the purchase and installation of photovoltaic components and systems.</p>
