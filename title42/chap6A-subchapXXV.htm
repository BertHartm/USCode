<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such exclusion relates to a condition (whether physical or mental), regardless of the cause of the condition, for which medical advice, diagnosis, care, or treatment was recommended or received within the 6-month period ending on the enrollment date;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such exclusion extends for a period of not more than 12 months (or 18 months in the case of a late enrollee) after the enrollment date; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the period of any such preexisting condition exclusion is reduced by the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage (if any, as defined in subsection (c)(1) of this section) applicable to the participant or beneficiary as of the enrollment date.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exceptions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Exclusion not applicable to certain newborns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (4), a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion in the case of an individual who, as of the last day of the 30-day period beginning with the date of birth, is covered under creditable coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exclusion not applicable to certain adopted children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (4), a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion in the case of a child who is adopted or placed for adoption before attaining 18 years of age and who, as of the last day of the 30-day period beginning on the date of the adoption or placement for adoption, is covered under creditable coverage.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The employee's or dependent's coverage described in subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was under a COBRA continuation provision and the coverage under such provision was exhausted; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was not under such a provision and either the coverage was terminated as a result of loss of eligibility for the coverage (including as a result of legal separation, divorce, death, termination of employment, or reduction in the number of hours of employment) or employer contributions toward such coverage were terminated.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Under the terms of the plan, the employee requests such enrollment not later than 30 days after the date of exhaustion of coverage described in subparagraph (C)(i) or termination of coverage or employer contribution described in subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a person becomes such a dependent of the individual through marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for adoption,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the group health plan shall provide for a dependent special enrollment period described in subparagraph (B) during which the person (or, if not otherwise enrolled, the individual) may be enrolled under the plan as a dependent of the individual, and in the case of the birth or adoption of a child, the spouse of the individual may be enrolled as a dependent of the individual if such spouse is otherwise eligible for coverage.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Dependent special enrollment period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A dependent special enrollment period under this subparagraph shall be a period of not less than 30 days and shall begin on the later of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the date of the marriage, birth, or adoption or placement for adoption (as the case may be) described in subparagraph (A)(iii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) No waiting period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If an individual seeks to enroll a dependent during the first 30 days of such a dependent special enrollment period, the coverage of the dependent shall become effective&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use of affiliation period by HMOs as alternative to preexisting condition exclusion</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A health maintenance organization which offers health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan and which does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion allowed under subsection (a) of this section with respect to any particular coverage option may impose an affiliation period for such coverage option, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such period is applied uniformly without regard to any health status-related factors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such period does not exceed 2 months (or 3 months in the case of a late enrollee).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Affiliation period</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;affiliation period&rdquo; means a period which, under the terms of the health insurance coverage offered by the health maintenance organization, must expire before the health insurance coverage becomes effective. The organization is not required to provide health care services or benefits during such period and no premium shall be charged to the participant or beneficiary for any coverage during the period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Beginning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such period shall begin on the enrollment date.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in this section, if a health insurance issuer offers health insurance coverage in the small or large group market in connection with a group health plan, the issuer must renew or continue in force such coverage at the option of the plan sponsor of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A health insurance issuer may nonrenew or discontinue health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan in the small or large group market based only on one or more of the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonpayment of premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The plan sponsor has failed to pay premiums or contributions in accordance with the terms of the health insurance coverage or the issuer has not received timely premium payments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The plan sponsor has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of the coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Violation of participation or contribution rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The plan sponsor has failed to comply with a material plan provision relating to employer contribution or group participation rules, as permitted under section 300gg&ndash;11(e) of this title in the case of the small group market or pursuant to applicable State law in the case of the large group market.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The issuer is ceasing to offer coverage in such market in accordance with subsection (c) of this section and applicable State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Movement outside service area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the market through a network plan, there is no longer any enrollee in connection with such plan who lives, resides, or works in the service area of the issuer (or in the area for which the issuer is authorized to do business) and, in the case of the small group market, the issuer would deny enrollment with respect to such plan under section 300gg&ndash;11(c)(1)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Association membership ceases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of health insurance coverage that is made available in the small or large group market (as the case may be) only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of an employer in the association (on the basis of which the coverage is provided) ceases but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor relating to any covered individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for uniform termination of coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Particular type of coverage not offered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which an issuer decides to discontinue offering a particular type of group health insurance coverage offered in the small or large group market, coverage of such type may be discontinued by the issuer in accordance with applicable State law in such market only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the issuer provides notice to each plan sponsor provided coverage of this type in such market (and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of such discontinuation at least 90 days prior to the date of the discontinuation of such coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuer offers to each plan sponsor provided coverage of this type in such market, the option to purchase all (or, in the case of the large group market, any) other <!-- PDFPage:1068 -->health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer to a group health plan in such market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in exercising the option to discontinue coverage of this type and in offering the option of coverage under subparagraph (B), the issuer acts uniformly without regard to the claims experience of those sponsors or any health status-related factor relating to any participants or beneficiaries covered or new participants or beneficiaries who may become eligible for such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Discontinuance of all coverage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which a health insurance issuer elects to discontinue offering all health insurance coverage in the small group market or the large group market, or both markets, in a State, health insurance coverage may be discontinued by the issuer only in accordance with applicable State law and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the issuer provides notice to the applicable State authority and to each plan sponsor (and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of such discontinuation at least 180 days prior to the date of the discontinuation of such coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) all health insurance issued or delivered for issuance in the State in such market (or markets) are discontinued and coverage under such health insurance coverage in such market (or markets) is not renewed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Prohibition on market reentry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a discontinuation under subparagraph (A) in a market, the issuer may not provide for the issuance of any health insurance coverage in the market and State involved during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the discontinuation of the last health insurance coverage not so renewed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for uniform modification of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the time of coverage renewal, a health insurance issuer may modify the health insurance coverage for a product offered to a group health plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the large group market; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the small group market if, for coverage that is available in such market other than only through one or more bona fide associations, such modification is consistent with State law and effective on a uniform basis among group health plans with that product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application to coverage offered only through associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In applying this section in the case of health insurance coverage that is made available by a health insurance issuer in the small or large group market to employers only through one or more associations, a reference to &ldquo;plan sponsor&rdquo; is deemed, with respect to coverage provided to an employer member of the association, to include a reference to such employer.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Guaranteed availability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the succeeding subsections of this section and section 300gg&ndash;44 of this title, each health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage (as defined in section 300gg&ndash;91(b)(1) of this title) in the individual market in a State may not, with respect to an eligible individual (as defined in subsection (b) of this section) desiring to enroll in individual health insurance coverage&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) decline to offer such coverage to, or deny enrollment of, such individual; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) impose any preexisting condition exclusion (as defined in section 300gg(b)(1)(A) of this title) with respect to such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substitution by State of acceptable alternative mechanism</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirement of paragraph (1) shall not apply to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in a State in which the State is implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism under section 300gg&ndash;44 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Eligible individual&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this part, the term &ldquo;eligible individual&rdquo; means an individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) for whom, as of the date on which the individual seeks coverage under this section, the aggregate of the periods of creditable coverage (as defined in section 300gg(c) of this title) is 18 or more months and (B) whose most recent prior creditable coverage was under a <!-- PDFPage:1073 -->group health plan, governmental plan, or church plan (or health insurance coverage offered in connection with any such plan);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) who is not eligible for coverage under (A) a group health plan, (B) part A or part B of title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395c et seq., 1395j et seq.], or (C) a State plan under title XIX of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.] (or any successor program), and does not have other health insurance coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) with respect to whom the most recent coverage within the coverage period described in paragraph (1)(A) was not terminated based on a factor described in paragraph (1) or (2) of section 300gg&ndash;12(b) of this title (relating to nonpayment of premiums or fraud);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the individual had been offered the option of continuation coverage under a COBRA continuation provision or under a similar State program, who elected such coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) who, if the individual elected such continuation coverage, has exhausted such continuation coverage under such provision or program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Alternative coverage permitted where no State mechanism</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in a State in which the State is not implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism under section 300gg&ndash;44 of this title, the health insurance issuer may elect to limit the coverage offered under subsection (a) of this section so long as it offers at least two different policy forms of health insurance coverage both of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are designed for, made generally available to, and actively marketed to, and enroll both eligible and other individuals by the issuer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) meet the requirement of paragraph (2) or (3), as elected by the issuer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this subsection, policy forms which have different cost-sharing arrangements or different riders shall be considered to be different policy forms.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Choice of most popular policy forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirement of this paragraph is met, for health insurance coverage policy forms offered by an issuer in the individual market, if the issuer offers the policy forms for individual health insurance coverage with the largest, and next to largest, premium volume of all such policy forms offered by the issuer in the State or applicable marketing or service area (as may be prescribed in regulation) by the issuer in the individual market in the period involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Choice of 2 policy forms with representative coverage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The requirement of this paragraph is met, for health insurance coverage policy forms offered by an issuer in the individual market, if the issuer offers a lower-level coverage policy form (as defined in subparagraph (B)) and a higher-level coverage policy form (as defined in subparagraph (C)) each of which includes benefits substantially similar to other individual health insurance coverage offered by the issuer in that State and each of which is covered under a method described in section 300gg&ndash;44(c)(3)(A) of this title (relating to risk adjustment, risk spreading, or financial subsidization).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Lower-level of coverage described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A policy form is described in this subparagraph if the actuarial value of the benefits under the coverage is at least 85 percent but not greater than 100 percent of a weighted average (described in subparagraph (D)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Higher-level of coverage described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A policy form is described in this subparagraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the actuarial value of the benefits under the coverage is at least 15 percent greater than the actuarial value of the coverage described in subparagraph (B) offered by the issuer in the area involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the actuarial value of the benefits under the coverage is at least 100 percent but not greater than 120 percent of a weighted average (described in subparagraph (D)).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Weighted average</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the weighted average described in this subparagraph is the average actuarial value of the benefits provided by all the health insurance coverage issued (as elected by the issuer) either by that issuer or by all issuers in the State in the individual market during the previous year (not including coverage issued under this section), weighted by enrollment for the different coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The issuer elections under this subsection shall apply uniformly to all eligible individuals in the State for that issuer. Such an election shall be effective for policies offered during a period of not shorter than 2 years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (3), the actuarial value of benefits provided under individual health insurance coverage shall be calculated based on a standardized population and a set of standardized utilization and cost factors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Special rules for network plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the individual market through a network plan, the issuer may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) limit the individuals who may be enrolled under such coverage to those who live, reside, or work within the service area for such network plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) within the service area of such plan, deny such coverage to such individuals if the issuer has demonstrated, if required, to the applicable State authority that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it will not have the capacity to deliver services adequately to additional in<!-- PDFPage:1074 -->dividual enrollees because of its obligations to existing group contract holders and enrollees and individual enrollees, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) it is applying this paragraph uniformly to individuals without regard to any health status-related factor of such individuals and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 180-day suspension upon denial of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer, upon denying health insurance coverage in any service area in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), may not offer coverage in the individual market within such service area for a period of 180 days after such coverage is denied.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-41_1_target" name="300gg-41_1">1</a></sup> Application of financial capacity limits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A health insurance issuer may deny health insurance coverage in the individual market to an eligible individual if the issuer has demonstrated, if required, to the applicable State authority that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it does not have the financial reserves necessary to underwrite additional coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) it is applying this paragraph uniformly to all individuals in the individual market in the State consistent with applicable State law and without regard to any health status-related factor of such individuals and without regard to whether the individuals are eligible individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) 180-day suspension upon denial of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer upon denying individual health insurance coverage in any service area in accordance with paragraph (1) may not offer such coverage in the individual market within such service area for a period of 180 days after the date such coverage is denied or until the issuer has demonstrated, if required under applicable State law, to the applicable State authority that the issuer has sufficient financial reserves to underwrite additional coverage, whichever is later. A State may provide for the application of this paragraph on a service-area-specific basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-41_1_target" name="300gg-41_1">1</a></sup> Market requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not be construed to require that a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage only in connection with group health plans or through one or more bona fide associations, or both, offer such health insurance coverage in the individual market.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Conversion policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with group health plans under this subchapter shall not be deemed to be a health insurance issuer offering individual health insurance coverage solely because such issuer offers a conversion policy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to restrict the amount of the premium rates that an issuer may charge an individual for health insurance coverage provided in the individual market under applicable State law; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to prevent a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in the individual market from establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and disease prevention.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Association membership ceases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of health insurance coverage that is made available in the individual market only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of the individual in the association (on the basis of which the coverage is provided) ceases but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of covered individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for uniform termination of coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Particular type of coverage not offered</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuer offers to each individual in the individual market provided coverage of this type, the option to purchase any other individual health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer for individuals in such market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in exercising the option to discontinue coverage of this type and in offering the option of coverage under subparagraph (B), the issuer acts uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of enrolled individuals or individuals who may become eligible for such coverage.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Waiver of requirements where implementation of acceptable alternative mechanism</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of section 300gg&ndash;41 of this title shall not apply with respect to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in the State so long as a State is found to be implementing, in accordance with this section and consistent with section 300gg&ndash;62(b) of this title, an alternative mechanism (in this section referred to as an &ldquo;acceptable alternative mechanism&rdquo;)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under which all eligible individuals are provided a choice of health insurance coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under which such coverage does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) under which such choice of coverage includes at least one policy form of coverage that is comparable to comprehensive health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in such State or that is comparable to a standard option of coverage available under the group or individual health insurance laws of such State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in a State which is implementing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a model act described in subsection (c)(1) of this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a qualified high risk pool described in subsection (c)(2) of this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a mechanism described in subsection (c)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Permissible forms of mechanisms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A private or public individual health insurance mechanism (such as a health insurance coverage pool or programs, mandatory group conversion policies, guaranteed issue of one or more plans of individual health insurance coverage, or open enrollment by one or more health insurance issuers), or combination of such mechanisms, that is designed to provide access to health benefits for individuals in the individual market in the State in accordance with this section may constitute an acceptable alternative mechanism.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application of acceptable alternative mechanisms</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Presumption</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, a State is presumed to be implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism in accordance with this section as of July 1, 1997, if, by not later than April 1, 1997, the chief executive officer of a State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) notifies the Secretary that the State has enacted or intends to enact (by not later than January 1, 1998, or July 1, 1998, in the case of a State described in subparagraph (B)(ii)) any necessary legislation to provide for the implementation of a mechanism reasonably designed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism as of January 1, 1998,<sup><a href="#300gg-44_1_target" name="300gg-44_1">1</a></sup> (or, in the case of a State described in subparagraph (B)(ii), July 1, 1998); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides the Secretary with such information as the Secretary may require to review the mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation) under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Delay permitted for certain States</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Effect of delay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a State described in clause (ii) that provides notice under subparagraph (A)(i), for the presumption to continue on and after July 1, 1998, the chief executive officer of the State by April 1, 1998&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) must notify the Secretary that the State has enacted any necessary legislation to provide for the implementation of a mechanism reasonably designed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism as of July 1, 1998; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) must provide the Secretary with such information as the Secretary may require to review the mechanism and its implementation (or proposed implementation) under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) States described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A State described in this clause is a State that has a legislature that does not meet within the 12-month period beginning on August 21, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Continued application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In order for a mechanism to continue to be presumed to be an acceptable alternative mechanism, the State shall provide the Secretary every 3 years with information described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (B)(i)(II) (as the case may be).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds, after review of information provided under paragraph (1) and in consultation with the chief executive officer of the State and the insurance commissioner or chief insurance regulatory official of the State, that such a mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or is not (or no longer) being implemented, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall notify the State of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such preliminary determination, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the consequences under paragraph (3) of a failure to implement such a mechanism; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall permit the State a reasonable opportunity in which to modify the mechanism (or to adopt another mechanism) in a manner so that may be an acceptable alternative mechanism or to provide for implementation of such a mechanism.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Final determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, after providing notice and opportunity under paragraph (2), the Secretary finds that the mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or the State is not implementing such a mechanism, the Secretary shall notify the State that the State is no <!-- PDFPage:1077 -->longer considered to be implementing an acceptable alternative mechanism and that the requirements of section 300gg&ndash;41 of this title shall apply to health insurance coverage offered in the individual market in the State, effective as of a date specified in the notice.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation on secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall not make a determination under paragraph (2) or (3) on any basis other than the basis that a mechanism is not an acceptable alternative mechanism or is not being implemented.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Future adoption of mechanisms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State, after January 1, 1997, submits the notice and information described in paragraph (1), unless the Secretary makes a finding described in paragraph (3) within the 90-day period beginning on the date of submission of the notice and information, the mechanism shall be considered to be an acceptable alternative mechanism for purposes of this section, effective 90 days after the end of such period, subject to the second sentence of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision related to risk</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Adoption of NAIC models</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The model act referred to in subsection (a)(1)(D)(i) of this section is the Small Employer and Individual Health Insurance Availability Model Act (adopted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners on June 3, 1996) insofar as it applies to individual health insurance coverage or the Individual Health Insurance Portability Model Act (also adopted by such Association on such date).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified high risk pool</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(D)(ii) of this section, a &ldquo;qualified high risk pool&rdquo; described in this paragraph is a high risk pool that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides to all eligible individuals health insurance coverage (or comparable coverage) that does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such coverage for all eligible individuals, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides for premium rates and covered benefits for such coverage consistent with standards included in the NAIC Model Health Plan for Uninsurable Individuals Act (as in effect as of August 21, 1996).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Other mechanisms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (a)(1)(D)(iii) of this section, a mechanism described in this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides for risk adjustment, risk spreading, or a risk spreading mechanism (among issuers or policies of an issuer) or otherwise provides for some financial subsidization for eligible individuals, including through assistance to participating issuers; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is a mechanism under which each eligible individual is provided a choice of all individual health insurance coverage otherwise available.</p>
