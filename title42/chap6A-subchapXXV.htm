<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A health insurance issuer may nonrenew or discontinue health insurance coverage offered in connection with a health insurance coverage offered in the group or individual market based only on one or more of the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonpayment of premiums</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan, the plan sponsor has failed to comply with a material plan provision relating to employer contribution or group participation rules, pursuant to applicable State law.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The issuer is ceasing to offer coverage in such market in accordance with subsection (c) of this section and applicable State law.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Movement outside service area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the market through a network plan, there is no longer any enrollee in connection with such plan who lives, resides, or works in the service area of the issuer (or in the area for which the issuer is authorized to do business) and, in the case of the small group market, the issuer would deny enrollment with respect to such plan under section 2711(c)(1)(A).<sup><a href="#300gg-2_1_target" name="300gg-2_1">1</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Association membership ceases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of health insurance coverage that is made available in the small or large group market (as the case may be) only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of an employer in the association (on the basis of which the coverage is provided) ceases but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor relating to any covered individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for uniform termination of coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Particular type of coverage not offered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which an issuer decides to discontinue offering a particular type of group or <!-- PDFPage:1290 -->individual health insurance coverage, coverage of such type may be discontinued by the issuer in accordance with applicable State law in such market only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the issuer provides notice to each plan sponsor or individual, as applicable, provided coverage of this type in such market (and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of such discontinuation at least 90 days prior to the date of the discontinuation of such coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuer offers to each plan sponsor or individual, as applicable, provided coverage of this type in such market, the option to purchase all (or, in the case of the large group market, any) other health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer to a group health plan or individual health insurance coverage in such market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in exercising the option to discontinue coverage of this type and in offering the option of coverage under subparagraph (B), the issuer acts uniformly without regard to the claims experience of those sponsors or individuals, as applicable, or any health status-related factor relating to any participants or beneficiaries covered or new participants or beneficiaries who may become eligible for such coverage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Discontinuance of all coverage</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which a health insurance issuer elects to discontinue offering all health insurance coverage in the individual or group market, or all markets, in a State, health insurance coverage may be discontinued by the issuer only in accordance with applicable State law and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the issuer provides notice to the applicable State authority and to each plan sponsor or individual, as applicable,<sup><a href="#300gg-2_2_target" name="300gg-2_2">2</a></sup> (and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of such discontinuation at least 180 days prior to the date of the discontinuation of such coverage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) all health insurance issued or delivered for issuance in the State in such market (or markets) are discontinued and coverage under such health insurance coverage in such market (or markets) is not renewed.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Prohibition on market reentry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a discontinuation under subparagraph (A) in a market, the issuer may not provide for the issuance of any health insurance coverage in the market and State involved during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the discontinuation of the last health insurance coverage not so renewed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for uniform modification of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the time of coverage renewal, a health insurance issuer may modify the health insurance coverage for a product offered to a group health plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the large group market; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the small group market if, for coverage that is available in such market other than only through one or more bona fide associations, such modification is consistent with State law and effective on a uniform basis among group health plans with that product.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application to coverage offered only through associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In applying this section in the case of health insurance coverage that is made available by a health insurance issuer in the small or large group market to employers only through one or more associations, a reference to &ldquo;plan sponsor&rdquo; is deemed, with respect to coverage provided to an employer member of the association, to include a reference to such employer.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage, may not require any individual (as a condition of enrollment or continued enrollment under the plan) to pay a premium or contribution which is greater than such premium or contribution for a similarly situated individual enrolled in the plan on the basis of any health status-related factor in relation to the individual or to an individual enrolled under the plan as a dependent of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in paragraph (1) shall be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to restrict the amount that an employer or individual may be charged for coverage under a group health plan except as provided in paragraph (3) or individual health coverage, as the case may be; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to prevent a group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering group health insurance coverage, from establishing premium discounts or rebates or modifying otherwise applicable copayments or deductibles in return for adherence to programs of health promotion and disease prevention.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No group-based discrimination on basis of genetic information</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in subparagraph (A) or in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (d) shall be construed to limit the ability of a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage to increase the premium for an employer based on the manifestation of a disease or disorder of an individual who is enrolled in the plan. In such case, the manifestation of a disease or disorder in one individual cannot also be used as genetic information about other group members and to further increase the premium for the employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Genetic testing</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, shall not request or require an individual or a family member of such individual to undergo a genetic test.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, may request, but not require, that a participant or beneficiary undergo a genetic test if each of the following conditions is met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The request is made pursuant to research that complies with part 46 of title 45, Code of Federal Regulations, or equivalent Federal regulations, and any applicable State or local law or regulations for the protection of human subjects in research.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The plan or issuer clearly indicates to each participant or beneficiary, or in the case of a minor child, to the legal guardian of such beneficiary, to whom the request is made that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Prohibition on collection of genetic information prior to enrollment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A group health plan, and a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, shall not request, require, or purchase genetic information with respect to any individual prior to such individual's enrollment under the plan or coverage in connection with such enrollment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Incidental collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a group health plan, or a health insurance issuer offering health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan, obtains genetic information incidental to the requesting, requiring, or purchasing of other information concerning any individual, such request, requirement, or purchase shall not be considered a violation of paragraph (2) if such request, requirement, or purchase is not in violation of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application to all plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsections (a)(6), (b)(3), (c), and (d) and subsection (b)(1) and section 300gg&ndash;3 of this title with respect to genetic information, shall apply to group health plans and health insurance issuers without regard to section 300gg&ndash;21(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-4_2_target" name="300gg-4_2">2</a></sup> of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General provisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B), a program of health promotion or disease prevention (referred to in this subsection as a &ldquo;wellness program&rdquo;) shall be a program offered by an employer that is designed to promote health or prevent disease that meets the applicable requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No conditions based on health status factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If none of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount or rebate or other reward for participation in a wellness program is based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor, such wellness program shall not violate this section if participation in the program is made available to all similarly situated individuals and the requirements of paragraph (2) are complied with.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Conditions based on health status factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If any of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount or rebate or other reward for participation in a wellness program is based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor, <!-- PDFPage:1298 -->such wellness program shall not violate this section if the requirements of paragraph (3) are complied with.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Wellness programs not subject to requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If none of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount or rebate or other reward under a wellness program as described in paragraph (1)(B) are based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor (or if such a wellness program does not provide such a reward), the wellness program shall not violate this section if participation in the program is made available to all similarly situated individuals. The following programs shall not have to comply with the requirements of paragraph (3) if participation in the program is made available to all similarly situated individuals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A program that reimburses all or part of the cost for memberships in a fitness center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A diagnostic testing program that provides a reward for participation and does not base any part of the reward on outcomes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A program that encourages preventive care related to a health condition through the waiver of the copayment or deductible requirement under group&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-4_1_target" name="300gg-4_1">1</a></sup> health plan for the costs of certain items or services related to a health condition (such as prenatal care or well-baby visits).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A program that reimburses individuals for the costs of smoking cessation programs without regard to whether the individual quits smoking.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) A program that provides a reward to individuals for attending a periodic health education seminar.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Wellness programs subject to requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any of the conditions for obtaining a premium discount, rebate, or reward under a wellness program as described in paragraph (1)(C) is based on an individual satisfying a standard that is related to a health status factor, the wellness program shall not violate this section if the following requirements are complied with:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The reward for the wellness program, together with the reward for other wellness programs with respect to the plan that requires satisfaction of a standard related to a health status factor, shall not exceed 30 percent of the cost of employee-only coverage under the plan. If, in addition to employees or individuals, any class of dependents (such as spouses or spouses and dependent children) may participate fully in the wellness program, such reward shall not exceed 30 percent of the cost of the coverage in which an employee or individual and any dependents are enrolled. For purposes of this paragraph, the cost of coverage shall be determined based on the total amount of employer and employee contributions for the benefit package under which the employee is (or the employee and any dependents are) receiving coverage. A reward may be in the form of a discount or rebate of a premium or contribution, a waiver of all or part of a cost-sharing mechanism (such as deductibles, copayments, or coinsurance), the absence of a surcharge, or the value of a benefit that would otherwise not be provided under the plan. The Secretaries of Labor, Health and Human Services, and the Treasury may increase the reward available under this subparagraph to up to 50 percent of the cost of coverage if the Secretaries determine that such an increase is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The wellness program shall be reasonably designed to promote health or prevent disease. A program complies with the preceding sentence if the program has a reasonable chance of improving the health of, or preventing disease in, participating individuals and it is not overly burdensome, is not a subterfuge for discriminating based on a health status factor, and is not highly suspect in the method chosen to promote health or prevent disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The plan shall give individuals eligible for the program the opportunity to qualify for the reward under the program at least once each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The full reward under the wellness program shall be made available to all similarly situated individuals. For such purpose, among other things:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The reward is not available to all similarly situated individuals for a period unless the wellness program allows&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for a reasonable alternative standard (or waiver of the otherwise applicable standard) for obtaining the reward for any individual for whom, for that period, it is unreasonably difficult due to a medical condition to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for a reasonable alternative standard (or waiver of the otherwise applicable standard) for obtaining the reward for any individual for whom, for that period, it is medically inadvisable to attempt to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) If reasonable under the circumstances, the plan or issuer may seek verification, such as a statement from an individual's physician, that a health status factor makes it unreasonably difficult or medically inadvisable for the individual to satisfy or attempt to satisfy the otherwise applicable standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The plan or issuer involved shall disclose in all plan materials describing the terms of the wellness program the availability of a reasonable alternative standard (or the possibility of waiver of the otherwise applicable standard) required under subparagraph (D). If plan materials disclose that such a program is available, without describing its terms, the disclosure under this subparagraph shall not be required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Existing programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall prohibit a program of health promotion or disease prevention that was established prior to March 23, 2010, and applied with all applicable regulations, and that <!-- PDFPage:1299 -->is operating on such date, from continuing to be carried out for as long as such regulations remain in effect.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) will not increase the cost to the Federal Government in providing credits under section 36B of title 26 or cost-sharing assistance under section 18071 of this title.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 300gg&ndash;2(b) of this title, referred to in text, was in the original a reference to section &ldquo;2702(c)&rdquo; of act July 1, 1944, which was translated as meaning section 2703(b) of act July 1, 1944, to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Section 2702(c), which is classified to section 300gg&ndash;1 of this title, relates to special rules for network plans, while section 2703(b) specifies the reasons for which a health insurance issuer may nonrenew or discontinue health insurance coverage offered in connection with a health insurance coverage offering in the group or individual market. Section 300gg&ndash;2(b) also parallels section 300gg&ndash;42(b) which appears in the same context in this section as the reference to section 300gg&ndash;2(b).</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>General Exceptions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A health insurance issuer may nonrenew or discontinue health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan in the small or large group market based only on one or more of the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Nonpayment of premiums</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The plan sponsor has failed to pay premiums or contributions in accordance with the terms of the health insurance coverage or the issuer has not received timely premium payments.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Fraud</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The plan sponsor has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud or made an intentional misrepresentation of material fact under the terms of the coverage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Violation of participation or contribution rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The plan sponsor has failed to comply with a material plan provision relating to employer contribution or group participation rules, as permitted under section 300gg&ndash;11(e) of this title in the case of the small group market or pursuant to applicable State law in the case of the large group market.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Termination of coverage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The issuer is ceasing to offer coverage in such market in accordance with subsection (c) and applicable State law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) <cap-smallcap>Movement outside service area</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the market through a network plan, there is no longer any enrollee in connection with such plan who lives, resides, or works in the service area of the issuer (or in the area for which the issuer is authorized to do business) and, in the case of the small group market, the issuer would deny enrollment with respect to such plan under section 300gg&ndash;11(c)(1)(A) of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) <cap-smallcap>Association membership ceases</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of health insurance coverage that is made available in the small or large group market (as the case may be) only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of an employer in the association (on the basis of which the coverage is provided) ceases but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor relating to any covered individual.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Requirements for Uniform Termination of Coverage.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) in exercising the option to discontinue coverage of this type and in offering the option of coverage under subparagraph (B), the issuer acts uniformly without regard to the claims experience of those sponsors or any health status-related factor relating to any participants or beneficiaries covered or new participants or beneficiaries who may become eligible for such coverage.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Discontinuance of all coverage.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In any case in which a health insurance issuer elects to discontinue offering all health insurance coverage in the small group market or the large group market, or both markets, in a State, health insurance coverage may be discontinued by the issuer only in accordance with applicable State law and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) the issuer provides notice to the applicable State authority and to each plan sponsor (and participants and beneficiaries covered under such coverage) of such discontinuation at least 180 days prior to the date of the discontinuation of such coverage; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) all health insurance issued or delivered for issuance in the State in such market (or markets) are discontinued and coverage under such health insurance coverage in such market (or markets) is not renewed.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) <cap-smallcap>Prohibition on market reentry</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of a discontinuation under subparagraph (A) in a market, the issuer may not provide for the issuance of any health insurance coverage in the market and State involved during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the discontinuation of the last health insurance coverage not so renewed.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Exception for Uniform Modification of Coverage</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the time of coverage renewal, a health insurance issuer may modify the health insurance coverage for a product offered to a group health plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in the large group market; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in the small group market if, for coverage that is available in such market other than only through one or more bona fide associations, such modification is consistent with State law and effective on a uniform basis among group health plans with that product.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Application to Coverage Offered Only Through Associations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In applying this section in the case of health insurance coverage that is made available by a health insurance issuer in the small or large group market to employers only through one or more associations, a reference to &lsquo;plan sponsor&rsquo; is deemed, with respect to coverage provided to an employer member of the association, to include a reference to such employer.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Clear accounting for costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage (including a grandfathered health plan) shall, with respect to each plan year, submit to the Secretary a report concerning the ratio of the incurred loss (or incurred claims) plus the loss adjustment expense (or change in contract reserves) to earned premiums. Such report shall include the percentage of total premium revenue, after accounting for collections or receipts for risk adjustment and risk corridors and payments of reinsurance, that such coverage expends&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on reimbursement for clinical services provided to enrollees under such coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for activities that improve health care quality; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) on all other non-claims costs, including an explanation of the nature of such costs, and excluding Federal and State taxes and licensing or regulatory fees.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall make reports received under this section available to the public on the Internet website of the Department of Health and Human Services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ensuring that consumers receive value for their premium payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement to provide value for premium payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Beginning not later than January 1, 2011, a health insurance issuer offering group or individual health insurance coverage (including a grandfathered health plan) shall, with respect to each plan year, provide an annual rebate to each enrollee under such coverage, on a pro rata basis, if the ratio of the amount of premium revenue expended by the issuer on costs described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) to the total amount of premium revenue (excluding Federal and State taxes and licensing or regulatory fees and after accounting for payments or receipts for risk adjustment, risk corridors, and reinsurance under sections 18061, 18062, and 18063 of this title) for the plan year (except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii)), is less than&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1311 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) with respect to a health insurance issuer offering coverage in the large group market, 85 percent, or such higher percentage as a State may by regulation determine; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to a health insurance issuer offering coverage in the small group market or in the individual market, 80 percent, or such higher percentage as a State may by regulation determine, except that the Secretary may adjust such percentage with respect to a State if the Secretary determines that the application of such 80 percent may destabilize the individual market in such State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rebate amount</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Calculation of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The total amount of an annual rebate required under this paragraph shall be in an amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the amount by which the percentage described in clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (A) exceeds the ratio described in such subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the total amount of premium revenue (excluding Federal and State taxes and licensing or regulatory fees and after accounting for payments or receipts for risk adjustment, risk corridors, and reinsurance under sections 18061, 18062, and 18063 of this title) for such plan year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Calculation based on average ratio</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Beginning on January 1, 2014, the determination made under subparagraph (A) for the year involved shall be based on the averages of the premiums expended on the costs described in such subparagraph and total premium revenue for each of the previous 3 years for the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consideration in setting percentages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the percentages under paragraph (1), a State shall seek to ensure adequate participation by health insurance issuers, competition in the health insurance market in the State, and value for consumers so that premiums are used for clinical services and quality improvements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall promulgate regulations for enforcing the provisions of this section and may provide for appropriate penalties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than December 31, 2010, and subject to the certification of the Secretary, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners shall establish uniform definitions of the activities reported under subsection (a) and standardized methodologies for calculating measures of such activities, including definitions of which activities, and in what regard such activities, constitute activities described in subsection (a)(2). Such methodologies shall be designed to take into account the special circumstances of smaller plans, different types of plans, and newer plans.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may adjust the rates described in subsection (b) if the Secretary determines appropriate on account of the volatility of the individual market due to the establishment of State Exchanges.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Standard hospital charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each hospital operating within the United States shall for each year establish (and update) and make public (in accordance with guidelines developed by the Secretary) a list of the hospital's standard charges for items and services provided by the hospital, including for diagnosis-related groups established under section 1395ww(d)(4) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) An amount equal to 40 percent of such appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be allotted in equal amounts to each qualifying State that is one of the 50 States or the District of Columbia and that applies for a grant under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) An amount equal to 30 percent of such appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be allotted among qualifying States that apply for such a grant so that the amount allotted to such a State bears the same ratio to such appropriated amount as the number of uninsured individuals in the State bears to the total number of uninsured individuals (as determined by the Secretary) in all qualifying States that so apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) An amount equal to 30 percent of such appropriated amount for the fiscal year shall be allotted among qualifying States that apply for such a grant so that the amount allotted to a State bears the same ratio to such appropriated amount as the number of individuals enrolled in health care coverage through the qualified high risk pool of the State bears to the total number of individuals so enrolled through qualified high risk pools (as determined by the Secretary) in all qualifying States that so apply.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for pools charging higher premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a qualified high risk pool of a State which charges premiums that exceed 150 percent of the premium for applicable standard risks, the State shall use at least 50 percent of the amount of the grant provided to <!-- PDFPage:1333 -->the State to carry out this subsection to reduce premiums for enrollees.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation for territories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In no case shall the aggregate amount allotted and made available under paragraph (2) for a fiscal year to States that are not the 50 States or the District of Columbia exceed $1,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Bonus grants for supplemental consumer benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funding</h4>
