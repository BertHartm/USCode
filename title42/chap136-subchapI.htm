<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grant authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General may make grants to individual States and to States organized as multi-State compacts to construct, develop, expand, modify, operate, or improve correctional facilities, including boot camp facilities and other alternative correctional facilities that can free conventional prison space for the confinement of violent offenders, to ensure that prison cell space is available for the confinement of violent offenders and to implement truth in sentencing laws for sentencing violent offenders.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to receive a grant under this part, a State or States organized as multi-State compacts shall submit an application to the Attorney General which includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assurances that the State or States have implemented, or will implement, correctional policies and programs, including truth in sentencing laws that ensure that violent offenders serve a substantial portion of the sentences imposed, that are designed to provide sufficiently severe punishment for violent offenders, including violent juvenile offenders, and that the prison time served is appropriately related to the determination that the inmate is a violent offender and for a period of time deemed necessary to protect the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) assurances that the State or States have implemented policies that provide for the recognition of the rights and needs of crime victims;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assurances that funds received under this section will be used to construct, develop, expand, modify, operate, or improve correctional facilities to ensure that prison cell space is available for the confinement of violent offenders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) assurances that the State or States have a comprehensive correctional plan which represents an integrated approach to the management and operation of correctional facilities and programs and which includes diversion programs, particularly drug diversion programs, community corrections programs, a prisoner screening and security classification system, appropriate professional training for corrections officers in dealing with violent offenders, prisoner rehabilitation and treatment programs, prisoner work activities (including, to the extent practicable, activities relating to the development, expansion, modification, or improvement of correctional facilities) and job skills programs, educational programs, a pre-release prisoner assessment to provide risk reduction management, post-release assistance, and an assessment of recidivism rates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) assurances that the State or States have involved counties and other units of local government, when appropriate, in the construction, development, expansion, modification, operation or improvement of correctional facilities designed to ensure the incarceration of violent offenders, and that the State or States will share funds received under this section with counties and other units of local government, taking into account the burden placed on these units of government when they are required to confine sentenced prisoners because of overcrowding in State prison facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) assurances that funds received under this section will be used to supplement, not supplant, other Federal, State, and local funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) assurances that the State or States have implemented, or will implement within 18 months after September 13, 1994, policies to determine the veteran status of inmates and to ensure that incarcerated veterans receive the veterans benefits to which they are entitled;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) if applicable, documentation of the multi-State compact agreement that specifies the construction, development, expansion, modification, operation, or improvement of correctional facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) if applicable, a description of the eligibility criteria for prisoner participation in any boot camp that is to be funded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General, in making such grants, shall give consideration to the special burden placed on States which incarcerate a substantial number of inmates who are in the United States illegally.</p>
