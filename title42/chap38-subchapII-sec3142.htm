<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Permissible guarantees; guarantee maximums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is authorized to aid in financing, within a redevelopment area, the purchase or development of land and facilities (including machinery and equipment) for industrial or commercial usage, including the construction of new buildings, the rehabilitation of abandoned or unoccupied buildings, and the alteration, conversion, or enlargement of existing buildings by (A) purchasing evidences of indebtedness, (B) making loans (which for purposes of this section shall include participation in loans), (C) guaranteeing loans made to private borrowers by private lending institutions, for any of the purposes referred to in this paragraph upon application of such institution and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, except that no such guarantee shall at any time exceed 90 per centum of the amount of the outstanding unpaid balance of such loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to any other financial assistance under this subchapter, the Secretary is authorized, in the case of any loan guarantee under authority of paragraph (1) of this section, to pay to or on behalf of the private borrower an amount sufficient to reduce up to 4 percentage points the interest paid by such borrower on such guaranteed loans. No payment under this paragraph shall result in the interest rate being paid by a borrower on such a guaranteed loan being less than the rate of interest for such a loan if it were made under section 3141 of this title. Payments made to or on behalf of such borrower shall be made no less often than annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary is authorized to aid in financing any industrial or commercial activity within a redevelopment area by (A) making working capital loans, (B) guaranteeing working capital loans made to private borrowers by private lending institutions upon application of such institution and upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe, except that no such guarantee shall at any time exceed 90 per centum of the amount of the outstanding unpaid balance of such loan, (C) guaranteeing rental payments of leases for buildings and equipment, except that no such guarantee shall exceed 90 per centum of the remaining rental payments required by the lease. (D) paying those debts with respect to which a lien against property has been legally obtained (including the refinancing of any such debt) in any case where the Secretary determines that it is essential to do so in order to save employment in a designated area, to avoid a significant rise in unemployment, or to create new or increased employment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Financial assistance under this section shall be on such terms and conditions as the Secretary determines, subject, however, to the following restrictions and limitations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Such financial assistance shall not be extended to assist establishments relocating from one area to another or to assist subcontractors whose purpose is to divest, or whose economic success is dependent upon divesting, other contractors or subcontractors of contracts theretofore customarily performed by them: <em>Provided, however</em>, That such limitation shall not be construed to prohibit assistance for the expansion of an existing business entity through the establishment of a new branch, affiliate, or subsidiary of such entity if the Secretary finds that the establishment of such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary will not result in an increase in unemployment of the area of original location or in any other area where such entity conducts business operations, unless the Secretary has reason to believe that such branch, affiliate, or subsidiary is being established with the intention of closing down the operations of the existing business entity in the area of its original location or in any other area where it conducts such operations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such assistance shall be extended only to applicants, both private and public (including Indian tribes), which have been approved for such assistance by an agency or instrumentality of the State or political subdivision thereof in which the project to be financed is located, and which agency or instrumentality is directly concerned with problems of economic development in such State or subdivision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The project for which financial assistance is sought must be reasonably calculated to <!-- PDFPage:3286 -->provide more than a temporary alleviation of unemployment or underemployment within the redevelopment area wherein it is or will be located.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) No loan or guarantee shall be extended hereunder unless the financial assistance applied for is not otherwise available from private lenders or from other Federal agencies on terms which in the opinion of the Secretary will permit the accomplishment of the project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The Secretary shall not make any loan without a participation unless he determines that the loan cannot be made on a participation basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) No evidences of indebtedness shall be purchased and no loans shall be made or guaranteed unless it is determined that there is reasonable assurance of repayment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Subject to section 3211(5) of this title, no loan or guarantee, including renewals or extension thereof, may be made hereunder for a period exceeding twenty-five years and no evidences of indebtedness maturing more than twenty-five years from date of purchase may be purchased hereunder: <em>Provided</em>, That the foregoing restrictions on maturities shall not apply to securities or obligations received by the Secretary as a claimant in bankruptcy or equitable reorganization or as a creditor in other proceedings attendant upon insolvency of the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Loans made and evidences of indebtedness purchased under this section shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, plus additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Secretary may determine to be consistent with its purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Loan assistance (other than for a working capital loan) shall not exceed 65 per centum of the aggregate cost to the applicant (excluding all other Federal aid in connection with the undertaking) of acquiring or developing land and facilities (including machinery and equipment), and of constructing, altering, converting, rehabilitating, or enlarging the building or buildings of the particular project, and shall, among others, be on the condition that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) other funds are available in an amount which, together with the assistance provided hereunder, shall be sufficient to pay such aggregate cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not less than 15 per centum of such aggregate cost be supplied as equity capital or as a loan repayable in no shorter period of time and at no faster an amortization rate than the Federal financial assistance extended under this section is being repaid, and if such a loan is secured, its security shall be subordinate and inferior to the lien or liens securing such Federal financial assistance: <em>Provided, however</em>, That, except in projects involving financial participation by Indian tribes, not less than 5 per centum of such aggregate cost shall be supplied by the State or any agency, instrumentality, or political subdivision thereof, or by a community or area organization which is nongovernmental in character, unless the Secretary shall determine in accordance with objective standards promulgated by regulation that all or part of such funds are not reasonably available to the project because of the economic distress of the area or for other good cause, in which case he may waive the requirement of this provision to the extent of such unavailability, and allow the funds required by this subsection to be supplied by the applicant or by such other non-Federal source as may reasonably be available to the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to the extent the Secretary finds such action necessary to encourage financial participation in a particular project by other lenders and investors, and except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (B), any Federal financial assistance extended under this section may be repayable only after other loans made in connection with such project have been repaid in full, and the security, if any, for such Federal financial assistance may be subordinate and inferior to the lien or liens securing other loans made in connection with the same project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) No such assistance shall be extended unless there shall be submitted to and approved by the Secretary an overall program for the economic development of the area and a finding by the State, or any agency, instrumentality, or local political subdivision thereof, that the project for which financial assistance is sought is consistent with such program: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this chapter shall authorize financial assistance for any project prohibited by laws of the State or local political subdivision in which the project would be located, nor prevent the Secretary from requiring such periodic revisions of previously approved overall economic development programs as he may deem appropriate.</p>
