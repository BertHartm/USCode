The 15 per centum deduction specified by section 2325(a) of this title, the deduction provided by section 2326(d) of this title, the financing provisions of section 2362 of this title, and the indemnity provided by sections 2363 to 2366 of this title shall be applicable to such priority sales of apartment houses. Priority interests granted by the Commission under this section shall be transferable as the Commission may by rule or regulation prescribe, but no priority right to purchase shall be transferred except as provided by section 2333 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Leasing arrangements by non-participants in apartment house sales; assumption of lessor's obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any occupant who does not participate in the purchase of an apartment house with respect to which a priority right to purchase has been granted shall be entitled, at the time of sale by the Commission, to a lease for occupancy of his housing unit for a period not to exceed fifteen months from the date the property was first offered for sale: <em>Provided</em>, That the occupant makes application for such a lease within 30 days of the grant of such priority to purchase. In selling any apartment house with respect to which lease executed under this section is in effect, the Commission is authorized to provide for the purchaser to assume any or all obligations of the lessor. The Commission in such event shall guarantee the lessee's performance of the lease.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Persons who have purchased, either individually or jointly with other persons, a single-family house or duplex house (or a single-family unit in a duplex house) at Los Alamos pursuant to a priority right under this chapter shall not be eligible to participate in the priority purchase of an apartment house.</p>
