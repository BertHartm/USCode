<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">insofar as the Indian is otherwise eligible to receive services from such Indian health care provider and the Indian health care provider has the capacity to provide primary care services to such Indian, the contract with the entity under section 1396b(m) of this title or under section 1396d(t)(3) of this title shall require, as a condition of receiving payment under such contract, that the Indian shall be allowed to choose such Indian health care provider as the Indian's primary care provider under the entity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Assurance of payment to Indian health care providers for provision of covered services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each contract with a managed care entity under section 1396b(m) of this title or under section 1396d(t)(3) of this title shall require any such entity, as a condition of receiving payment under such contract, to satisfy the following requirements:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Demonstration of access to Indian health care providers and application of alternative payment arrangements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) agree to pay Indian health care providers, whether such providers are participating or nonparticipating providers with respect to the entity, for covered Medicaid managed care services provided to those Indian enrollees who are eligible to receive services from such providers at a rate equal to the rate negotiated between such entity and the provider involved or, if such a rate has not been negotiated, at a rate that is not less than the level and amount of payment which the entity would make for the services if the services were furnished by a participating provider which is not an Indian health care provider.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary shall establish procedures for applying the requirements of clause (i) in States where there are no or few Indian health providers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">To agree to make prompt payment (consistent with rule for prompt payment of providers under section 1396u&ndash;2(f) of this title) to Indian health care providers that are participating providers with respect to such entity or, in the case of an entity to which subparagraph (A)(ii) or (C) applies, that the entity is required to pay in accordance with that subparagraph.</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Continued application of State requirement to make supplemental payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Nothing in subclause (I) or subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be construed as waiving the application of section 1396a(bb)(5) of this title regarding the State plan requirement to make any supplemental payment due under such section to a federally-qualified health center for services furnished by such center to an enrollee of a managed care entity (regardless of whether the federally-qualified health center is or is not a participating provider with the entity).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payment rate for services provided by certain Indian health care providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the amount paid by a managed care entity to an Indian health care provider that is not a federally-qualified health center for services provided by the provider to an Indian enrollee with the managed care entity is less than the rate that applies to the provision of such services by the provider under the State plan, the plan shall provide for payment to the Indian health care provider, whether the provider is a participating or nonparticipating provider with respect to the entity, of the difference between such applicable rate and the amount paid by the managed care entity to the provider for such services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as waiving the application of section 1396a(a)(30)(A) of this title (relating to application of standards to assure that payments are consistent with efficiency, economy, and quality of care).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Special rule for enrollment for Indian managed care entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Regarding the application of a Medicaid managed care program to Indian Medicaid managed care entities, an Indian Medicaid managed care entity may restrict enrollment under such program to Indians in the same manner as Indian Health Programs may restrict the delivery of services to Indians.</p>
