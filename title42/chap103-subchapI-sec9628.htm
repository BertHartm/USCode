<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B) and subject to subparagraph (C), in the case of an eligible response site at which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) there is a release or threatened release of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a person is conducting or has completed a response action regarding the specific release that is addressed by the response action that is in compliance with the State program that specifically governs response actions for the protection of public health and the environment,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the President may not use authority under this chapter to take an administrative or judicial enforcement action under section 9606(a) of this title or to take a judicial enforcement action to recover response costs under section 9607(a) of this title against the person regarding the specific release that is addressed by the response action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The President may bring an administrative or judicial enforcement action under this chapter during or after completion of a response action described in subparagraph (A) with respect to a release or threatened release at an eligible response site described in that subparagraph if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the State requests that the President provide assistance in the performance of a response action;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Administrator determines that contamination has migrated or will migrate across a State line, resulting in the need for further response action to protect human health or the environment, or the President determines that contamination has migrated or is likely to migrate onto property subject to the jurisdiction, custody, or control of a department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States and may impact the authorized purposes of the Federal property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) after taking into consideration the response activities already taken, the Administrator determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a release or threatened release may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to public health or welfare or the environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) additional response actions are likely to be necessary to address, prevent, limit, or mitigate the release or threatened release; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the Administrator, after consultation with the State, determines that information, that on the earlier of the date on which cleanup was approved or completed, was not known by the State, as recorded in documents prepared or relied on in selecting or conducting the cleanup, has been discovered regarding the contamination or conditions at a facility such that the contamination or conditions at the facility present a threat requiring further remediation to protect public health or welfare or the environment. Consultation with the State shall not limit the ability of the Administrator to make this determination.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Public record</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limitations on the authority of the President under subparagraph (A) apply only at sites in States that maintain, update not less than annually, and make available to the public a record of sites, by name and location, at which response actions have been completed in the previous year and are planned to be addressed under the State program that specifically governs response actions for the protection of public health and the environment in the upcoming year. The public record shall identify whether or not the site, on completion of the response action, will be suitable for unrestricted use and, if not, shall identify the institutional controls relied on in the remedy. Each State and tribe receiving financial assistance under subsection (a) of this section shall maintain and make available to the public a record of sites as provided in this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) notify the State of the action the Administrator intends to take; and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) State reply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than 48 hours after a State receives notice from the Administrator under clause (i), the State shall notify the Administrator if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the release at the eligible response site is or has been subject to a cleanup conducted under a State program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the State is planning to abate the release or threatened release, any actions that are planned.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Immediate Federal action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Administrator may take action immediately after giving notification under clause (i) without waiting for a State reply under clause (ii) if the Administrator determines that one or more exceptions under subparagraph (B) are met.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 90 days after the date of initiation of any enforcement action by the President under clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (B), the President shall submit to Congress a report describing the basis for the enforcement action, including specific references to the facts demonstrating that enforcement action is permitted under subparagraph (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) modifies or otherwise affects a memorandum of agreement, memorandum of understanding, or any similar agreement relating to this chapter between a State agency or an Indian tribe and the Administrator that is in effect on or before January 11, 2002 (which agreement shall remain in effect, subject to the terms of the agreement); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) limits the discretionary authority of the President to enter into or modify an agreement with a State, an Indian tribe, or any other person relating to the implementation by the President of statutory authorities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective date</h4>
