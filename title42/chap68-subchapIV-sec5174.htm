<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) has utilities provided by the State or local government, by the owner of the site, or by the occupant who was displaced by the major disaster.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other sites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Mobile homes and other readily fabricated dwellings may be located on sites provided by the President if the President determines that such sites would be more economical or accessible than sites described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Federal financial and operational assistance under this section shall continue for not longer than 18 months after the date of the major disaster declaration by the President, unless the President determines that due to extraordinary circumstances it would be in the public interest to extend such 18-month period.</p>

Such assistance shall be provided for the duration of the period of financial hardship but not to exceed 18 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) In lieu expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In lieu of providing other types of temporary housing after a major disaster, the President is authorized to make expenditures for the purpose of repairing or restoring to a habitable condition owner-occupied private residential structures made uninhabitable by a major disaster which are capable of being restored quickly to a habitable condition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of temporary housing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Direct sale to occupants</h4>
