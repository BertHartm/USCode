<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that the storage of substantial quantities of petroleum products will diminish the vulnerability of the United States to the effects of a severe energy supply interruption, and provide limited protection from the short-term consequences of interruptions in supplies of petroleum products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is hereby declared to be the policy of the United States to provide for the creation of a Strategic Petroleum Reserve for the storage of up to 1 billion barrels of petroleum products, but not less than 150 million barrels of petroleum products by the end of the 3&ndash;year period which begins on December 22, 1975, for the purpose of reducing the impact of disruptions in supplies of petroleum products or to carry out obligations of the United States under the international energy program. It is further declared to be the policy of the United States to provide for the creation of an Early Storage Reserve, as part of the Reserve, for the purpose of providing limited protection from the impact of near-term disruptions in supplies of petroleum products or to carry out obligations of the United States under the international energy program.</p>
