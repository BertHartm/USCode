<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Class I administrative penalty</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per violation may be assessed by the President in the case of any of the following&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A violation of the requirements of section 9603(a) or (b) of this title (relating to notice).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A violation of the requirements of section 9603(d)(2) of this title (relating to destruction of records, etc.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) A violation of the requirements of section 9608 of this title (relating to financial responsibility, etc.), the regulations issued under section 9608 of this title, or with any denial or detention order under section 9608 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) A violation of an order under section 9622(d)(3) of this title (relating to settlement agreements for action under section 9604(b) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Any failure or refusal referred to in section 9622(<em>l</em>) of this title (relating to violations of administrative orders, consent decrees, or agreements under section 9620 of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice and hearings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No civil penalty may be assessed under this subsection unless the person accused of the violation is given notice and opportunity for a hearing with respect to the violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determining amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of any penalty assessed pursuant to this subsection, the President shall take into account the nature, circumstances, extent and gravity of the violation or violations and, with respect to the violator, ability to pay, any prior history of such violations, the degree of culpability, economic benefit or savings (if any) resulting from the violation, and such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any person against whom a civil penalty is assessed under this subsection may obtain review thereof in the appropriate district court of the United States by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 30 days from the date of such order and by simultaneously sending a copy of such notice by certified mail to the <!-- PDFPage:5890 -->President. The President shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record upon which such violation was found or such penalty imposed. If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order or after the appropriate court has entered final judgment in favor of the United States, the President may request the Attorney General of the United States to institute a civil action in an appropriate district court of the United States to collect the penalty, and such court shall have jurisdiction to hear and decide any such action. In hearing such action, the court shall have authority to review the violation and the assessment of the civil penalty on the record.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Subpoenas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, or documents in connection with hearings under this subsection. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpoena issued pursuant to this paragraph and served upon any person, the district court of the United States for any district in which such person is found, resides, or transacts business, upon application by the United States and after notice to such person, shall have jurisdiction to issue an order requiring such person to appear and give testimony before the administrative law judge or to appear and produce documents before the administrative law judge, or both, and any failure to obey such order of the court may be punished by such court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Class II administrative penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day for each day during which the violation continues may be assessed by the President in the case of any of the following&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A violation of the notice requirements of section 9603(a) or (b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A violation of section 9603(d)(2) of this title (relating to destruction of records, etc.).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A violation of the requirements of section 9608 of this title (relating to financial responsibility, etc.), the regulations issued under section 9608 of this title, or with any denial or detention order under section 9608 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A violation of an order under section 9622(d)(3) of this title (relating to settlement agreements for action under section 9604(b) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Any failure or refusal referred to in section 9622(<em>l</em>) of this title (relating to violations of administrative orders, consent decrees, or agreements under section 9620 of this title).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of a second or subsequent violation the amount of such penalty may be not more than $75,000 for each day during which the violation continues. Any civil penalty under this subsection shall be assessed and collected in the same manner, and subject to the same provisions, as in the case of civil penalties assessed and collected after notice and opportunity for hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5. In any proceeding for the assessment of a civil penalty under this subsection the President may issue subpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of relevant papers, books, and documents and may promulgate rules for discovery procedures. Any person who requested a hearing with respect to a civil penalty under this subsection and who is aggrieved by an order assessing the civil penalty may file a petition for judicial review of such order with the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit or for any other circuit in which such person resides or transacts business. Such a petition may only be filed within the 30-day period beginning on the date the order making such assessment was issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Judicial assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may bring an action in the United States district court for the appropriate district to assess and collect a penalty of not more than $25,000 per day for each day during which the violation (or failure or refusal) continues in the case of any of the following&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A violation of the requirements of section 9608 of this title (relating to financial responsibility, etc.), the regulations issued under section 9608 of this title, or with any denial or detention order under section 9608 of this title.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
