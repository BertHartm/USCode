Except as provided in paragraph (3), a grant under this section shall be used by such program only for awards of compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the sums available in the Fund for grants under this section are insufficient to provide grants of 40 percent as provided in paragraph (1), the Director shall make, from the sums available, a grant to each eligible crime victim compensation program so that all such programs receive the same percentage of the amounts awarded by such program during the preceding fiscal year, other than amounts awarded for property damage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not more than 5 percent of a grant made under this section may be used for the administration of the State crime victim compensation program receiving the grant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such program, as to compensable crimes occurring within the State, makes compensation awards to victims who are nonresidents of the State on the basis of the same criteria used to make awards to victims who are residents of such State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such program provides compensation to victims of Federal crimes occurring within the State on the same basis that such program provides compensation to victims of State crimes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such program provides compensation to residents of the State who are victims of crimes occurring outside the State if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the crimes would be compensable crimes had they occurred inside that State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the places the crimes occurred in are States not having eligible crime victim compensation programs;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such program does not, except pursuant to rules issued by the program to prevent unjust enrichment of the offender, deny compensation to any victim because of that victim's familial relationship to the offender, or because of the sharing of a residence by the victim and the offender; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) such program provides such other information and assurances related to the purposes of this section as the Director may reasonably require.</p>
