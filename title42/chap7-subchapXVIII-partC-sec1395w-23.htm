<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Payment before 2006</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For years before 2006, the payment amount shall be equal to 1/12 of the annual MA capitation rate (as calculated under subsection (c)(1) of this section) with respect to that individual for that area, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and reduced by the amount of any reduction elected under section 1395w&ndash;24(f)(1)(E) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payment for original fee-for-service benefits beginning with 2006</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For years beginning with 2006, the amount specified in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Payment amount for original fee-for-service benefits beginning with 2006</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Payment of bid for plans with bids below benchmark</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a plan for which there are average per capita monthly savings described in section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(3)(C) or 1395w&ndash;24(b)(4)(C) of this title, as the case may be, the amount specified in this subparagraph is equal to the unadjusted MA statutory non-drug monthly bid amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and (if applicable) under subparagraphs (F) and (G), plus the amount (if any) of any rebate under subparagraph (E).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payment of benchmark for plans with bids at or above benchmark</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a plan for which there are no average per capita monthly savings described in section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(3)(C) or 1395w&ndash;24(b)(4)(C) of this title, as the case may be, the amount specified in this subparagraph is equal to the MA area-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and (if applicable) under subparagraphs (F) and (G).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Payment of benchmark for MSA plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), in the case of an MSA plan, the amount spec<!-- PDFPage:2475 -->ified in this subparagraph is equal to the MA area-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Demographic adjustment, including adjustment for health status</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall adjust the payment amount under subparagraph (A)(i) and the amount specified under subparagraph (B)(i), (B)(ii), and (B)(iii) for such risk factors as age, disability status, gender, institutional status, and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, including adjustment for health status under paragraph (3), so as to ensure actuarial equivalence. The Secretary may add to, modify, or substitute for such adjustment factors if such changes will improve the determination of actuarial equivalence.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Application during phase-out of budget neutrality factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For 2006 through 2010:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) In applying the adjustment under clause (i) for health status to payment amounts, the Secretary shall ensure that such adjustment reflects changes in treatment and coding practices in the fee-for-service sector and reflects differences in coding patterns between Medicare Advantage plans and providers under part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395w-23_1_target" name="1395w-23_1">1</a></sup> A and B to the extent that the Secretary has identified such differences.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) In order to ensure payment accuracy, the Secretary shall conduct an analysis of the differences described in subclause (I). The Secretary shall complete such analysis by a date necessary to ensure that the results of such analysis are incorporated into the risk scores only for 2008, 2009, and 2010. In conducting such analysis, the Secretary shall use data submitted with respect to 2004 and subsequent years, as available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Separate payment for Federal drug subsidies</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reimbursement for premium and cost-sharing reductions for low-income individuals under section 1395w&ndash;114(c)(1)(C) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Payment of rebate for plans with bids below benchmark</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan for which there are average per capita monthly savings described in section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(3)(C) or 1395w&ndash;24(b)(4)(C) of this title, as the case may be, the amount specified in this subparagraph is the amount of the monthly rebate computed under section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(1)(C)(i) of this title for that plan and year (as reduced by the amount of any credit provided under section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(1)(C)(iv) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Adjustment for intra-area variations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Intra-regional variations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of payment with respect to an MA regional plan for an MA region, the Secretary shall also adjust the amounts specified under subparagraphs (B)(i) and (B)(ii) in a manner to take into account variations in MA local payment rates under this part among the different MA local areas included in such region.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Intra-service area variations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of payment with respect to an MA local plan for a service area that covers more than one MA local area, the Secretary shall also adjust the amounts specified under subparagraphs (B)(i) and (B)(ii) in a manner to take into account variations in MA local payment rates under this part among the different MA local areas included in such service area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Adjustment relating to risk adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall adjust payments with respect to MA plans as necessary to ensure that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Special rule for end-stage renal disease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish separate rates of payment to a Medicare+Choice organization with respect to classes of individuals determined to have end-stage renal disease and enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan of the organization. Such rates of payment shall be actuarially equivalent to rates that would have been paid with respect to other enrollees in the MA payment area (or such other area as specified by the Secretary) under the provisions of this section as in effect before December 8, 2003. In accordance with regulations, the Secretary shall provide for the application of the seventh sentence of section 1395rr(b)(7) of this title to payments under this section covering the provision of renal dialysis treatment in the same manner as such sentence applies to composite rate payments described in such sentence. In establishing such rates, the Secretary shall provide for appropriate adjustments to increase each rate to reflect the demonstration rate (including the risk adjustment methodology associated with such rate) of the social health maintenance organization end-stage renal disease capitation demonstrations (established by section 2355 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, as <!-- PDFPage:2476 -->amended by section 13567(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993), and shall compute such rates by taking into account such factors as renal treatment modality, age, and the underlying cause of the end-stage renal disease. The Secretary may apply the competitive bidding methodology provided for in this section, with appropriate adjustments to account for the risk adjustment methodology applied to end stage renal disease payments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to reflect number of enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of payment under this subsection may be retroactively adjusted to take into account any difference between the actual number of individuals enrolled with an organization under this part and the number of such individuals estimated to be so enrolled in determining the amount of the advance payment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for certain enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary may make retroactive adjustments under subparagraph (A) to take into account individuals enrolled during the period beginning on the date on which the individual enrolls with a Medicare+Choice organization under a plan operated, sponsored, or contributed to by the individual's employer or former employer (or the employer or former employer of the individual's spouse) and ending on the date on which the individual is enrolled in the organization under this part, except that for purposes of making such retroactive adjustments under this subparagraph, such period may not exceed 90 days.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No adjustment may be made under clause (i) with respect to any individual who does not certify that the organization provided the individual with the disclosure statement described in section 1395w&ndash;22(c) of this title at the time the individual enrolled with the organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Establishment of risk adjustment factors</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall develop, and submit to Congress by not later than March 1, 1999, a report on the method of risk adjustment of payment rates under this section, to be implemented under subparagraph (C), that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status. Such report shall include an evaluation of such method by an outside, independent actuary of the actuarial soundness of the proposal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Data collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In order to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary shall require Medicare+Choice organizations (and eligible organizations with risk-sharing contracts under section 1395mm of this title) to submit data regarding inpatient hospital services for periods beginning on or after July 1, 1997, and data regarding other services and other information as the Secretary deems necessary for periods beginning on or after July 1, 1998.
