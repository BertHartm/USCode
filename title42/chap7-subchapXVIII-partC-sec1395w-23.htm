<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payments to organizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Monthly payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under a contract under section 1395w&ndash;27 of this title and subject to subsections (e) and (f) of this section and section 1395w&ndash;28(e)(4) of this title, the Secretary shall make monthly payments under this section in advance to each Medicare+Choice organization, with respect to coverage of an individual under this part in a Medicare+Choice payment area for a month, in an amount equal to 1/12 of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate (as calculated under subsection (c) of this section) with respect to that individual for that area, adjusted for such risk factors as age, disability status, gender, institutional status, and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, so as to ensure actuarial equivalence. The Secretary may add to, modify, or substitute for such factors, if such changes will improve the determination of actuarial equivalence.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for end-stage renal disease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish separate rates of payment to a Medicare+Choice organization with respect to classes of individuals determined to have end-stage renal disease and enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan of the organization. Such rates of payment shall be actuarially equivalent to rates paid to other enrollees in the Medicare+Choice payment area (or such other area as specified by the Secretary). In accordance with regulations, the Secretary shall provide for the application of the seventh sentence of section 1395rr(b)(7) of this title to payments under this section covering the provision of renal dialysis treatment in the same manner as such sentence applies to composite rate payments described in such sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to reflect number of enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of payment under this subsection may be retroactively adjusted to take into account any difference between the actual number of individuals enrolled with an organization under this part and the number of such individuals estimated to be so enrolled in determining the amount of the advance payment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for certain enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary may make retroactive adjustments under subparagraph (A) to take into account individuals enrolled during the period beginning on the date on which the individual enrolls with a Medicare+Choice organization under a plan operated, sponsored, or contributed to by the individual's employer or former employer (or the employer or former employer of the individual's spouse) and ending on the date on which the individual is enrolled in the organization under this part, except that for purposes of making such retroactive adjustments under this subparagraph, such period may not exceed 90 days.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No adjustment may be made under clause (i) with respect to any individual who does not certify that the organization provided the individual with the disclosure statement described in section 1395w&ndash;22(c) of this title at the time the individual enrolled with the organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Establishment of risk adjustment factors</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall develop, and submit to Congress by not later than March 1, 1999, a report on the method of risk adjustment of payment rates under this section, to be implemented under subparagraph (C), that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status. Such report shall include an evaluation of such method by an outside, independent actuary of the actuarial soundness of the proposal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Data collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In order to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary shall require Medicare+Choice organizations (and eligible organizations with risk-sharing contracts under section 1395mm of this title) to submit data regarding inpatient hospital services for periods beginning on or after July 1, 1997, and data regarding other services and other information as the Secretary deems necessary for periods beginning on or after July 1, 1998. The Secretary may not require an organization to submit such data before January 1, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Initial implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall first provide for implementation of a risk adjustment methodology <!-- PDFPage:1914 -->that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status and other demographic factors for payments by no later than January 1, 2000.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Uniform application to all types of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to section 1395w&ndash;28(e)(4) of this title, the methodology shall be applied uniformly without regard to the type of plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Annual announcement of payment rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Annual announcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall annually determine, and shall announce (in a manner intended to provide notice to interested parties) not later than March 1 before the calendar year concerned&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate for each Medicare+Choice payment area for the year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the risk and other factors to be used in adjusting such rates under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section for payments for months in that year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Advance notice of methodological changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At least 45 days before making the announcement under paragraph (1) for a year, the Secretary shall provide for notice to Medicare+Choice organizations of proposed changes to be made in the methodology from the methodology and assumptions used in the previous announcement and shall provide such organizations an opportunity to comment on such proposed changes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Explanation of assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In each announcement made under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include an explanation of the assumptions and changes in methodology used in the announcement in sufficient detail so that Medicare+Choice organizations can compute monthly adjusted Medicare+Choice capitation rates for individuals in each Medicare+Choice payment area which is in whole or in part within the service area of such an organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Calculation of annual Medicare+Choice capitation rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, subject to paragraphs (6)(C) and (7), each annual Medicare+�Choice capitation rate, for a Medicare+Choice payment area for a contract year consisting of a calendar year, is equal to the largest of the amounts specified in the following subparagraph (A), (B), or (C):</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Blended capitation rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the area-specific percentage (as specified under paragraph (2) for the year) of the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for the Medicare+Choice payment area, as determined under paragraph (3) for the year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the national percentage (as specified under paragraph (2) for the year) of the input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate, as determined under paragraph (4) for the year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">multiplied by the budget neutrality adjustment factor determined under paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">12 multiplied by the following amount:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) For 1998, $367 (but not to exceed, in the case of an area outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia, 150 percent of the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the area).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) For a succeeding year, the minimum amount specified in this clause (or clause (i)) for the preceding year increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage, described in paragraph (6)(A) for that succeeding year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Minimum percentage increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For 1998, 102 percent of the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the Medicare+Choice payment area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For a subsequent year, 102 percent of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate under this paragraph for the area for the previous year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Area-specific and national percentages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) for a year after 2002, the &ldquo;area-specific percentage&rdquo; is 50 percent and the &ldquo;national percentage&rdquo; is 50 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), subject to subparagraph (B), the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for 1998 is, subject to subparagraph (D), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the area, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for 1998 (described in paragraph (6)(A)); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for a subsequent year is the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for the previous year determined under this paragraph for the area, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for such subsequent year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1915 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Removal of medical education from calculation of adjusted average per capita cost</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate under subparagraph (A) for a year (beginning with 1998), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title shall be adjusted to exclude from the rate the applicable percent (specified in clause (ii)) of the payment adjustments described in subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicable percent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percent for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 1998 is 20 percent,</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Payment adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), the payment adjustments described in this subparagraph are payment adjustments which the Secretary estimates were payable during 1997&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for the indirect costs of medical education under section 1395ww(d)(5)(B) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for direct graduate medical education costs under section 1395ww(h) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Treatment of payments covered under State hospital reimbursement system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">To the extent that the Secretary estimates that an annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 described in clause (i) reflects payments to hospitals reimbursed under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title, the Secretary shall estimate a payment adjustment that is comparable to the payment adjustment that would have been made under clause (i) if the hospitals had not been reimbursed under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of areas with highly variable payment rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a Medicare+Choice payment area for which the annual per capita rate of payment determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for 1997 varies by more than 20 percent from such rate for 1996, for purposes of this subsection the Secretary may substitute for such rate for 1997 a rate that is more representative of the costs of the enrollees in the area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area for a year is equal to the sum, for all the types of medicare services (as classified by the Secretary), of the product (for each such type of service) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate (determined under subparagraph (B)) for the year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the proportion of such rate for the year which is attributable to such type of services, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an index that reflects (for that year and that type of services) the relative input price of such services in the area compared to the national average input price of such services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In applying clause (iii), the Secretary may, subject to subparagraph (C), apply those indices under this subchapter that are used in applying (or updating) national payment rates for specific areas and localities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) National standardized annual Medicare+�Choice capitation rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In subparagraph (A)(i), the &ldquo;national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate&rdquo; for a year is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sum (for all Medicare+Choice payment areas) of the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the annual area-specific Medicare+�Choice capitation rate for that year for the area under paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the average number of medicare beneficiaries residing in that area in the year, multiplied by the average of the risk factor weights used to adjust payments under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section for such beneficiaries in such area; divided by</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sum of the products described in clause (i)(II) for all areas for that year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rules for 1998</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying this paragraph for 1998&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) medicare services shall be divided into 2 types of services: part A services and part B services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the proportions described in subparagraph (A)(ii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for part A services shall be the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the national average annual per capita rate of payment for part A of this subchapter for 1997 to the total national average annual per capita rate of payment for parts A and B of this subchapter for 1997, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for part B services shall be 100 percent minus the ratio described in subclause (I);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for part A services, 70 percent of payments attributable to such services shall be adjusted by the index used under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title to adjust payment rates for relative hospital wage levels for hospitals located in the payment area involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) for part B services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 66 percent of payments attributable to such services shall be adjusted by the index of the geographic area factors under section 1395w&ndash;4(e) of this title used <!-- PDFPage:1916 -->to adjust payment rates for physicians&rsquo; services furnished in the payment area, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) of the remaining 34 percent of the amount of such payments, 40 percent shall be adjusted by the index described in clause (iii); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the index values shall be computed based only on the beneficiary population who are 65 years of age or older and who are not determined to have end stage renal disease.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary may continue to apply the rules described in this subparagraph (or similar rules) for 1999.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Payment adjustment budget neutrality factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), for each year, the Secretary shall determine a budget neutrality adjustment factor so that the aggregate of the payments under this part shall equal the aggregate payments that would have been made under this part if payment were based entirely on area-specific capitation rates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) &ldquo;National per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this part, the &ldquo;national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage&rdquo; for a year is the percentage determined by the Secretary, by March 1st before the beginning of the year involved, to reflect the Secretary's estimate of the projected per capita rate of growth in expenditures under this subchapter for an individual entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter and enrolled under part B of this subchapter, reduced by the number of percentage points specified in subparagraph (B) for the year. Separate determinations may be made for aged enrollees, disabled enrollees, and enrollees with end-stage renal disease.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The number of percentage points specified in this subparagraph is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) for a year after 2002, 0 percentage points.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment for over or under projection of national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Beginning with rates calculated for 1999, before computing rates for a year as described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adjust all area-specific and national Medicare+Choice capitation rates (and beginning in 2000, the minimum amount) for the previous year for the differences between the projections of the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for that year and previous years and the current estimate of such percentage for such years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Adjustment for national coverage determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary makes a determination with respect to coverage under this subchapter that the Secretary projects will result in a significant increase in the costs to Medicare+Choice of providing benefits under contracts under this part (for periods after any period described in section 1395w&ndash;22(a)(5) of this title), the Secretary shall adjust appropriately the payments to such organizations under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Medicare+Choice payment area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this part, except as provided in paragraph (3), the term &ldquo;Medicare+Choice payment area&rdquo; means a county, or equivalent area specified by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule for ESRD beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of individuals who are determined to have end stage renal disease, the Medicare+Choice payment area shall be a State or such other payment area as the Secretary specifies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Geographic adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon written request of the chief executive officer of a State for a contract year (beginning after 1998) made by not later than February 1 of the previous year, the Secretary shall make a geographic adjustment to a Medicare+Choice payment area in the State otherwise determined under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to a single statewide Medicare+Choice payment area,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the metropolitan based system described in subparagraph (C), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to consolidating into a single Medicare+Choice payment area noncontiguous counties (or equivalent areas described in paragraph (1)) within a State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Such adjustment shall be effective for payments for months beginning with January of the year following the year in which the request is received.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Budget neutrality adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a State requesting an adjustment under this paragraph, the Secretary shall initially (and annually thereafter) adjust the payment rates otherwise established under this section for Medicare+Choice payment areas in the State in a manner so that the aggregate of the payments under this section in the State shall not exceed the aggregate payments that would have been made under this section for Medicare+Choice payment areas in the State in the absence of the adjustment under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Metropolitan based system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The metropolitan based system described in this subparagraph is one in which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) all areas in the State that do not fall within a metropolitan statistical area are treated as a single Medicare+Choice payment area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In subparagraph (C), the terms &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo;, &ldquo;consolidated metropolitan statistical area&rdquo;, and &ldquo;primary metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; mean any area designated as such by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rules for individuals electing MSA plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount of the Medicare+Choice monthly MSA premium (as defined in section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(2)(C) of this title) for an MSA plan for a year is less than 1/12 of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate applied under this section for the area and year involved, the Secretary shall deposit an amount equal to 100 percent of such difference in a Medicare+�Choice MSA established (and, if applicable, designated) by the individual under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Establishment and designation of Medicare+Choice medical savings account as requirement for payment of contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an individual who has elected coverage under an MSA plan, no payment shall be made under paragraph (1) on behalf of an individual for a month unless the individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has established before the beginning of the month (or by such other deadline as the Secretary may specify) a Medicare+Choice MSA (as defined in section 138(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the individual has established more than one such Medicare+Choice MSA, has designated one of such accounts as the individual's Medicare+Choice MSA for purposes of this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Under rules under this section, such an individual may change the designation of such account under subparagraph (B) for purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Lump-sum deposit of medical savings account contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an individual electing an MSA plan effective beginning with a month in a year, the amount of the contribution to the Medicare+Choice MSA on behalf of the individual for that month and all successive months in the year shall be deposited during that first month. In the case of a termination of such an election as of a month before the end of a year, the Secretary shall provide for a procedure for the recovery of deposits attributable to the remaining months in the year.</p>
