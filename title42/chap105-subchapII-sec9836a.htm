<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Quality standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment of standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish by regulation standards, including minimum levels of overall accomplishment, applicable to Head Start agencies, programs, and projects under this subchapter, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) education performance standards to ensure the school readiness of children participating in a Head Start program, on completion of the Head Start program and prior to entering school; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) administrative and financial management standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) standards relating to the condition and location of facilities for such agencies, programs, and projects; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such other standards as the Secretary finds to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations in developing standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In developing the regulations required under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consult with experts in the fields of child development, early childhood education, child health care, family services (including linguistically and culturally appropriate services to non-English language background children and their families), administration, and financial management, and with persons with experience in the operation of Head Start programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take into consideration&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) the need for, and state-of-the-art developments relating to, local policies and activities designed to ensure that children participating in Head Start programs make a successful transition to public schools; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) review and revise as necessary the performance standards in effect under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) ensure that any such revisions in the performance standards will not result in the elimination of or any reduction in the scope or types of health, education, parental involvement, nutritional, social, or other services required to be provided under such standards as in effect on October 27, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Standards relating to obligations to delegate agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In developing standards under this subsection, the Secretary shall describe the obligations of a Head Start agency to a delegate agency to which the Head Start agency has delegated responsibility for providing services under this subchapter and determine whether the Head Start agency complies with the standards.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Results-based performance measures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, in consultation with representatives of Head Start agencies and with experts in the fields of early childhood education and development, family services, and program management, shall develop methods and procedures for measuring, annually and over longer periods, the quality and effectiveness of programs operated by Head Start agencies, and the impact of the services provided <!-- PDFPage:5640 -->through the programs to children and their families (referred to in this subchapter as &ldquo;results-based performance measures&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Characteristics of measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The performance measures developed under this subsection shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) be adaptable for use in self-assessment, peer review, and program evaluation of individual Head Start agencies and programs, not later than July 1, 1999; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) be developed for other program purposes as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall use the performance measures developed pursuant to this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to identify strengths and weaknesses in the operation of Head Start programs nationally, regionally, and locally; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to identify problem areas that may require additional training and technical assistance resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Educational performance measures</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Monitoring of local agencies and programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to determine whether Head Start agencies meet standards established under this subchapter and results-based performance measures developed by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section with respect to program, administrative, financial management, and other requirements, the Secretary shall conduct the following reviews of designated Head Start agencies, and of the Head Start programs operated by such agencies:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A full review of each such agency at least once during each 3-year period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) include as part of the reviews of the programs, a review and assessment of program effectiveness, as measured in accordance with the results-based performance measures developed by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (b) of this section and with the performance standards established pursuant to subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) seek information from the communities and the States involved about the performance of the programs and the efforts of the Head Start agencies to collaborate with other entities carrying out early childhood education and child care programs in the community.</p>
