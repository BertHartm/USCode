<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the existence of an adequate supply of water of good quality for the production of materials and energy for the Nation's needs and for the efficient use of the Nation's energy and water resources is essential to national economic stability and growth, and to the well-being of the people;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the management of water resources is closely related to maintaining environmental quality, productivity of natural resources and agricultural systems, and social well-being;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) there is an increasing threat of impairment to the quantity and quality of surface and groundwater resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Nation's capabilities for technological assessment and planning and for policy formulation for water resources must be strengthened at the Federal, State, and local governmental levels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there should be a continuing national investment in water and related research and technology commensurate with growing national needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) it is necessary to provide for the research and development of technology for the conversion of saline and other impaired waters to a quality suitable for municipal, industrial, agricultural, recreational, and other beneficial uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the Nation must provide programs to strengthen research and associated graduate education because the pool of scientists, engineers, and technicians trained in fields related to water resources constitutes an invaluable natural resource which should be increased, fully utilized, and regularly replenished; and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#10301_1_target" name="10301_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Secretary of the Interior is authorized and directed to demonstrate the engineering and economic viability of membrane and phase-change desalting processes. Such demonstrations shall include the study, design, construction, operation, and maintenance of desalting plants at locations in the United States (which may include the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Guam, the Virgin Islands, the Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands): <em>Provided</em>, That at least two such plants shall demonstrate desalting of brackish ground water: <em>And provided further</em>, That the plants constructed pursuant to this section shall be for the purpose of showing that the technology being demonstrated is ready for application; such plants shall be sufficient to demonstrate the specific application of the technology, and shall be significantly different in operation and process so as not to duplicate any other demonstration plant constructed pursuant to this section. The Secretary is further authorized to conduct such demonstrations or any portion thereof by means of cooperative agreements (as defined and authorized by 41 U.S.C. 504 et seq. (the Federal Grant and Cooperative Agreement Act of 1977; Public Law 95&ndash;224)) [31 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.] with duly authorized non-Federal public entities. Title to demonstration facilities constructed by the non-Federal public entity under a cooperative agreement shall vest in the non-Federal public entity.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Funds appropriated pursuant to the authority provided by this section [this note] may not be expended until thirty calendar days (excluding days on which either the House of Representatives or the Senate is not in session because of an adjournment of more than three calendar days to a day certain) have elapsed following transmittal of a report to the chairman of the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs [now Committee on Natural Resources] of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the United States Senate. Such report shall present information that includes, but is not limited to, how the plant being proposed differs from others, if any, already constructed under this section, the location of the demonstration plant, the characteristics of the water proposed to be desalted, the process to be utilized, the water supply problems confronting the area in which the plant will be located, alternative sources of water and their probable cost, the capacity of the plant, the initial investment cost of the demonstration plant, the annual operating cost of the demonstration plant, the source of energy for the plant and its cost, the means of reject brine disposal and its environmental consequences, and the unit cost of product water, considering the amortization of all components of the demonstration plant and ancillary facilities. Such report shall be accompanied by a proposed contract (or cooperative agreement) between the Secretary and a duly authorized non-Federal entity, in which such entity shall agree to provide not less than 15 per centum and not more than 35 per centum of the total cost of the demonstration; such cost to include, without being limited to, necessary water rights, water supplies, rights-of-way, power source interconnections, brine disposal facilities, land, construction, ancillary facilities, and the operation and maintenance costs for a period of four years following final acceptance of the construction of the plant from the plant contractor. The contributions of the non-Federal entity under such proposed contract may be in-kind. During the participation by the Secretary in the construction and the operation and maintenance of such demonstration, access to the demonstration and its operating data will not be denied to the Secretary or his representatives. The period of participation by the Secretary in the operation and maintenance of any such demonstration shall be four years. The Secretary is authorized to include in the proposed contract a provision for conveying, as appropriate, and in such amounts as are appropriate, rights, title, and interest of the Federal Government in the demonstration project to the non-Federal public entity.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6602 --><p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) There is authorized to be appropriated, to remain available until expended, for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1978, and thereafter, the sum of $50,000,000 to finance the total Federal share of the cost of the demonstration plants authorized by this section; such cost to include, without being limited to, necessary water rights, water supplies, rights-of-way, power source interconnections, brine disposal facilities, land, construction, ancillary facilities, and the operation and maintenance costs for the four-year period of Federal participation in such costs.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) When appropriations have been made for the commencement or continuation of design, construction, or operation and maintenance of any demonstration plant authorized under this Act [this note], the Secretary may, in connection with such design, construction, or operation and maintenance, enter into contracts and cooperative agreements for miscellaneous services, for materials and supplies, as well as for construction, which may cover such periods of time as the Secretary may consider necessary but in which the liability of the United States shall be contingent upon appropriations being made therefor.&rdquo;</p>
