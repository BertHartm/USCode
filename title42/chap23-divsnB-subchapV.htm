Such grants shall be used by the private corporation to carry out any remaining predeployment activity assigned to the private corporation by the Corporation. Such grants may not be used for the costs of constructing an AVLIS, or alternative technologies for uranium enrichment, production facility or engaging in directly related preconstruction activities (other than such assigned predeployment activities). The aggregate amount of such grants shall not exceed $364,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Licensing agreement</h4>
