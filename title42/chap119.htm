<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Nation faces an immediate and unprecedented crisis due to the lack of shelter for a growing number of individuals and families, including elderly persons, handicapped persons, families with children, Native Americans, and veterans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the problem of homelessness has become more severe and, in the absence of more effective efforts, is expected to become dramatically worse, endangering the lives and safety of the homeless;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the causes of homelessness are many and complex, and homeless individuals have diverse needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) there is no single, simple solution to the problem of homelessness because of the different subpopulations of the homeless, the different causes of and reasons for homelessness, and the different needs of homeless individuals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) due to the record increase in homelessness, States, units of local government, and private voluntary organizations have been unable to meet the basic human needs of all the homeless and, in the absence of greater Federal assistance, will be unable to protect the lives and safety of all the homeless in need of assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Federal Government has a clear responsibility and an existing capacity to fulfill a more effective and responsible role to meet the basic human needs and to engender respect for the human dignity of the homeless.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a city or county eligible for a grant under subsection (a) of this section fails to obtain approval of its comprehensive plan during the 90-day period following the date funds authorized by this part first become available for allocation during any fiscal year, the amount that the city or county would have received shall be available to the State in which the city or county is located if the State has obtained approval of its comprehensive plan. Any amounts that cannot be allocated to a State under the preceding sentence shall be reallocated to other States, counties, and cities that demonstrate extraordinary need or large numbers of homeless individuals, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a State fails to obtain approval of its comprehensive plan during the 90-day period following the date funds authorized by this part first become available for allocation during any fiscal year, the amount that the State would have received shall be reallocated to other States and to cities and counties as applicable, that demonstrate extraordinary need or large numbers of homeless individuals, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Allocations to territories</h4>
