<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall establish such security requirements and safeguards, including restrictions with respect to access to information and property as the Director considers necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on employee access to information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall be permitted to have access to information or property with respect to which access restrictions have been established under this section, until it shall have been determined that no information is contained in the files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation or any other investigative agency of the Government indicating that such employee is of questionable loyalty or reliability for security purposes, or if any such information is so disclosed, until the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall have conducted a full field investigation concerning such person and a report thereon shall have been evaluated in writing by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) National security positions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No employee of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall occupy any position determined by the Director to be of critical importance from the standpoint of national security until a full field investigation concerning such employee shall have been conducted by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and a report thereon shall have been evaluated in writing by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In the event such full field investigation by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management develops any data reflecting that such applicant for a position of critical importance is of questionable loyalty or reliability for security purposes, or if the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any other reason considers it to be advisable, such investigation shall be discontinued and a report thereon shall be referred to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for evaluation in writing. Thereafter, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency may refer the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the conduct of a full field investigation by such Bureau. The result of such latter investigation by such Bureau shall be furnished to the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency for action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">&ldquo;And I do further swear (or affirm) that I do not advocate, nor am I a member or an affiliate of any organization, group, or combination of persons that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence; and that during such time as I am a member of &#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95;&#95; (name of emergency preparedness organization), I will not advocate nor become a member or an affiliate of any organization, group, or combination of persons that advocates the overthrow of the Government of the United States by force or violence.&rdquo;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

Any person who shall be found guilty of having falsely taken such oath shall be punished as provided in section 1621 of title 18.</p>
