<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Counting of cases in areas with exemptions</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">With respect to a State that is under a reporting system for living non-AIDS cases of HIV that is not names-based (referred to in this subparagraph as &ldquo;code-based reporting&rdquo;), the Secretary shall, for purposes of this subparagraph, modify the number of such cases reported for the State in order to adjust for duplicative reporting in and among systems that use code-based reporting.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Adjustment rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The adjustment rate under subclause (I) for a State shall be a reduction of 5 percent for fiscal years before fiscal year 2012 (and 6 percent for fiscal year 2012) in the number of living non-AIDS cases of HIV reported for the State.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(III) Increased adjustment for certain States previously using code-based reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">For purposes of this subparagraph for each of fiscal years 2010 through 2012, the Secretary shall deem the applicable number of living cases of HIV/AIDS in a State that were reported to and confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to be 3 percent higher than the actual number if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) there is an area in such State that satisfies all of the conditions described in items (aa) through (cc) of section 300ff&ndash;13(a)(3)(C)(vi)(III) of this title; or</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Applicability of exemption requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The provisions of clauses (ii) through (vii) may not be construed as having any legal effect for fiscal year 2013 or any subsequent fiscal year, and accordingly, the status of a State for purposes of such clauses may not be considered after fiscal year 2012.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ix) Program for detecting inaccurate or fraudulent counting</h4>
