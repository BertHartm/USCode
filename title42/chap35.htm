<p class="statutory-body">(1) In carrying out the requirement of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the State may designate as a planning and service area any unit of general purpose local government which has a population of 100,000 or more. In any case in which a unit of general purpose local government makes application to the State agency under the preceding sentence to be designated as a planning and service area, the State agency shall, upon request, provide an opportunity for a hearing to such unit of general purpose local government. A State may designate as a planning and service area under subsection (a)(1) of this section, any region within the State recognized for purposes of areawide planning which includes one or more such units of general purpose local government when the State determines that the designation of such a regional planning and service area is necessary for, and will enhance, the effective administration of the programs authorized by this subchapter. The State may include in any planning and service area designated under subsection (a)(1) of this section such additional areas adjacent to the unit of general purpose local government or regions so designated as the State determines to be necessary for, and will enhance the effective administration of the programs authorized by this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The chief executive officer of each State in which a planning and service area crosses State boundaries, or in which an interstate Indian reservation is located, may apply to the Assistant Secretary to request redesignation as an interstate planning and service area comprising the entire metropolitan area or Indian reservation. If the Assistant Secretary approves such an application, the Assistant Secretary shall adjust the State allotments of the areas within the planning and service area in which the interstate planning and service area is established to reflect the number of older individuals within the area who will be served by an interstate planning and service area not within the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Whenever a unit of general purpose local government, a region, a metropolitan area or an Indian reservation is denied designation under the provisions of subsection (a)(1) of this section, such unit of general purpose local government, region, metropolitan area, or Indian reservation may appeal the decision of the State agency to the Assistant Secretary. The Assistant Secretary shall afford such unit, region, metropolitan area, or Indian reservation an opportunity for a hearing. In carrying out the provisions of this paragraph, the Assistant Secretary may approve the decision of the State agency, disapprove the decision of the State agency and require the State agency to designate the unit, region, area, or Indian reservation appealing the decision as a planning and service area, or take such other action as the Assistant Secretary deems appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), in the case of a grantee that has an application approved under subchapter X of this chapter for a fiscal year but that did not receive assistance under this section for the preceding fiscal year, the number of meals served by the subchapter X grantee for the preceding fiscal year shall be deemed to equal the number of meals that the Assistant Secretary estimates will be served by the subchapter X grantee in the fiscal year for which the application was approved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Donation of products</h4>

Such amount shall include an amount bearing the same ratio to the costs to the Secretary of Agriculture of providing such commodities under this subsection as the value of commodities received by such State agency or subchapter X grantee under this subsection bears to the total value of commodities so received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) From the allotment under subsection (b) of this section for each State agency and subchapter X grantee, the Secretary shall first reimburse the Secretary of Agriculture for costs of commodities received by such State agency or grantee under this subsection, and shall then pay the balance (if any) to such State agency or grantee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide that any legal or ombudsman services made available to older individuals who are Indians represented by the tribal organization will be substantially in compliance with the provisions of subchapter III of this chapter relating to the furnishing of similar services;</p>
