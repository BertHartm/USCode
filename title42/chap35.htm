<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Full restoration services for those who require institutional care, and a comprehensive array of community-based, long-term care services adequate to appropriately sustain older people in their communities and in their homes, including support to family members and other persons providing voluntary care to older individuals needing long-term care services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Opportunity for employment with no discriminatory personnel practices because of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Retirement in health, honor, dignity&mdash;after years of contribution to the economy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Efficient community services, including access to low-cost transportation, which provide a choice in supported living arrangements and social assistance in a coordinated manner and which are readily available when needed, with emphasis on maintaining a continuum of care for vulnerable older individuals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Freedom, independence, and the free exercise of individual initiative in planning and managing their own lives, full participation in the planning and operation of community-based services and programs provided for their benefit, and protection against abuse, neglect, and exploitation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Formula for computation of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), from the sums appropriated under section 3023 of this title for each fiscal year, each State shall be allotted an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of older individuals in such State bears to the population of older individuals in all States, except that (A) no State shall be allotted less than one-half of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; (B) Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, shall each be allotted not less than one-fourth of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and (C) American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be allotted not less than one-sixteenth of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made. For the purposes of paragraph (3) and the exception contained in subparagraph (A) only, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not include Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unused funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that any amount allotted to a State under part B or C of this subchapter for a fiscal year under this section will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Assistant Secretary shall make such allotment available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Assistant Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this subchapter, be regarded as part of such State's allotment (as determined under subsection (a) of this section) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Withholding of funds; disbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Assistant Secretary finds that any State has failed to qualify under the State plan requirements of section 3027 of this title or the Assistant Secretary does not approve the funding formula required under section 3025(a)(2)(C) of this title, the Assistant Secretary shall withhold the allotment of funds to such State referred to in subsection (a) of this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such amount (excluding any amount attributable to funds appropriated under section 3023(a)(3) of this title) as the State agency determines to be adequate for conducting an effective ombudsman program under section 3027(a)(12) of this title shall be available for conducting such program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not less than $150,000 and not more than 4 percent of the amount allotted to the State for carrying out part B of this subchapter, shall be available for conducting outreach demonstration projects under section 3058e of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the remainder of such allotment shall be available to such State only for paying such percentage as the State agency determines, but not more than 85 percent of the cost of supportive services, senior centers, and nutrition services under this subchapter provided in the State as part of a comprehensive and coordinated system in planning and service areas for which there is an area plan approved by the State agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In carrying out the requirement of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the State may designate as a planning and service area any unit of general purpose local government which has a population of 100,000 or more. In any case in which a unit of general purpose local government makes application to the State agency under the preceding sentence to be designated as a planning and service area, the State agency shall, upon request, provide an opportunity for a hearing to such unit of general purpose local government. A State may designate as a planning and service area under subsection (a)(1) of this section, any region within the State recognized for purposes of areawide planning which includes one or more such units of general purpose local government when the State determines that the designation of such a regional planning and service area is necessary for, and will enhance, the effective administration of the programs authorized by this subchapter.

The Assistant Secretary shall afford such unit, region, metropolitan area, or Indian reservation an opportunity for a hearing.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) allowing an appeal of the decision of the State agency in the action or proceeding to the Assistant Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) An adversely affected party involved in an action or proceeding described in clause (i) may bring an appeal described in clause (ii)(V) on the basis of&mdash;</p>
