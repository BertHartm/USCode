<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Nation is suffering from a shortage of environmentally acceptable forms of energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Compounding this energy shortage is our past and present failure to formulate a comprehensive and aggressive research and development program designed to make available to American consumers our large domestic energy reserves including fossil fuels, nuclear fuels, geothermal resources, solar energy, and other forms of energy. This failure is partially because the unconventional energy technologies have not been judged to be economically competitive with traditional energy technologies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The urgency of the Nation's energy challenge will require commitments similar to those undertaken in the Manhattan and Apollo projects; it will require that the Nation undertake a research, development, and demonstration program in nonnuclear energy technologies with a total Federal investment which may reach or exceed $20,000,000,000 over the next decade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In undertaking such program, full advantage must be taken of the existing technical and managerial expertise in the various energy fields within Federal agencies and particularly in the private sector.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Nation's future energy needs can be met if a national commitment is made now to dedicate the necessary financial resources, to enlist our scientific and technological capabilities, and to accord the proper priority to developing new nonnuclear energy options to serve national needs, conserve vital resources, and protect the environment.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) It is the policy of the Congress to develop on an urgent basis the technological capabilities to support the broadest range of energy policy options through conservation and use of domestic resources by socially and environmentally acceptable means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Congress declares the purpose of this chapter to be to establish and vigorously conduct a comprehensive, national program of basic and applied research and development, including but not limited to demonstrations of practical applications, of all potentially beneficial energy sources and utilization technologies, within the Department of Energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out this program, the Secretary of Energy (hereinafter in this chapter referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall be governed by the terms of this chapter and other applicable provisions of law with respect to all nonnuclear aspects of the research, development, and demonstration program; and the policies and provisions of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 [42 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.], and other provisions of law shall continue to apply to the nuclear research, development, and demonstration program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In implementing and conducting the research, development, and demonstration programs pursuant to this chapter, the Secretary shall incorporate programs in specific nonnuclear technologies previously enacted into law, including those established by the Solar Heating and Cooling Act of 1974 (Public Law 93&ndash;409) [42 U.S.C. 5501 et seq.], the Geothermal Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 (Public Law 93&ndash;410) [30 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.], and the Solar Energy Research, Development, and Demonstration Act of 1974 (Public Law 93&ndash;473) [42 U.S.C. 5551 et seq.].</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress authorizes and directs that the comprehensive program in research, development, and demonstration required by this chapter shall be designed and executed according to the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Energy conservation shall be a primary consideration in the design and implementation of the Federal nonnuclear energy program. For the purposes of this chapter, energy conservation means both improvement in efficiency of energy production and use, and reduction in energy waste.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The environmental and social consequences of a proposed program shall be analyzed and considered in evaluating its potential.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any program for the development of a technology which may require significant con<!-- PDFPage:3974 -->sumptive use of water after the technology has reached the stage of commercial application shall include thorough consideration of the impacts of such technology and use on water resources pursuant to the provisions of section 5912 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Heavy emphasis shall be given to those technologies which utilize renewable or essentially inexhaustible energy sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The potential for production of net energy by the proposed technology at the stage of commercial application shall be analyzed and considered in evaluating proposals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress further directs that the execution of the comprehensive research, development, and demonstration program shall conform to the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Research and development of nonnuclear energy sources shall be pursued in such a way as to facilitate the commercial availability of adequate supplies of energy to all regions of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In determining the appropriateness of Federal involvement in any particular research and development undertaking, the Secretary shall give consideration to the extent to which the proposed undertaking satisfies criteria including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The urgency of public need for the potential results of the research, development, or demonstration effort is high, and it is unlikely that similar results would be achieved in a timely manner in the absence of Federal assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The potential opportunities for non-Federal interests to recapture the investment in the undertaking through the normal commercial utilization of proprietary knowledge appear inadequate to encourage timely results.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The extent of the problems treated and the objectives sought by the undertaking are national or widespread in their significance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) There are limited opportunities to induce non-Federal support of the undertaking through regulatory actions, end use controls, tax and price incentives, public education, or other alternatives to direct Federal financial assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The degree of risk of loss of investment inherent in the research is high, and the availability or risk capital to the non-Federal entities which might otherwise engage in the field of the research is inadequate for the timely development of the technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The magnitude of the investment appears to exceed the financial capabilities of potential non-Federal participants in the research to support effective efforts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Each such corporation may design, construct, operate, and maintain one or more experimental, demonstration, or commercial-size facilities, or other operations which will ascertain the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of a particular energy technology. In carrying out this function, the corporation shall be empowered, either directly or by contract, to utilize commercially available technologies, perform tests, or design, construct, and operate pilot plants, as may be necessary for the design of the full-scale facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Each corporation shall have&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a Board of nine directors consisting of individuals who are citizens of the United States, of whom one shall be elected annually by the Board to serve as Chairman. The Board shall be empowered to adopt and amend bylaws. Five members of the Board shall be appointed by the President of the United States, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and four members of the Board shall be appointed by the President on the basis of recommendations received by him from any non-Federal entity or entities entering into contractual arrangements to participate in the corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a President and such other officers and employees as may be named and appointed by the Board (with the rates of compensation of all officers and employees being fixed by the Board); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the usual powers conferred upon corporations by the laws of the District of Columbia.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) An appropriate time interval, not to exceed 12 years, shall be established for the term of Federal participation in the corporation, at the expiration of which the Board of Directors shall take such action as may be necessary to dissolve the corporation or otherwise terminate Federal participation and financial interests. In carrying out such dissolution, the Board of Directors shall dispose of all physical facilities of the corporation in such manner and subject to such terms and conditions as the Board determines are in the public interest and consistent with existing law; and a share of the appraised value of the corporate assets proportional to the Federal participation in the corporation, including the proceeds from the disposition of such facilities, on the date of its dissolution, after satisfaction of all its legal obligations, shall be made available to the United States and deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts. All patent rights of the corporation shall, on such date of dissolution, be vested in the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That Federal participation may be terminated prior to the time established in the authorizing Act upon recommendation of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Any commercially valuable product produced by demonstration facilities shall be disposed of in such manner and under such terms and conditions as the corporation shall prescribe.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The estimated Federal share of the construction, operation, and maintenance cost over the life of each corporation shall be determined in order to facilitate a single congressional authorization of the full amount at the time of establishment of the corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The Federal share of the cost of each such corporation shall reflect (A) the technical and economic risk of the venture, (B) the probability of any financial return to the non-Federal participants arising from the venture, (C) the financial capability of the potential non-Federal participants, and (D) such other factors as the Secretary may set forth in proposing the corporation: <em>Provided</em>, That in no instance shall the Federal share exceed 90 per centum of the cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) No such corporation shall be established unless previously authorized by specific legislation enacted by the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Proposed competitive systems of price supports for demonstration facilities; guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Competitive systems of price supports proposed for congressional authorization pursuant to this chapter shall conform to the following guidelines:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall determine the types and capacities of the desired full-scale, commercial-size facility or other operation which would demonstrate the technical, environmental, and economic feasibility of a particular nonnuclear energy technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary may award planning grants for the purpose of financing a study of <!-- PDFPage:3978 -->the full cycle economic and environmental costs associated with the demonstration facility selected pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection. Such planning grants may be awarded to Federal and non-Federal entities including, but not limited to, industrial entities, universities, and nonprofit organizations. Such planning grants may also be used by the grantee to prepare a detailed and comprehensive bid to construct the demonstration facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Following the completion of the studies pursuant to the planning grants awarded under paragraph (2) of this subsection regarding each such potential price supported demonstration facility for which the Secretary intends to request congressional authorization, he shall invite bids from all interested parties to determine the minimum amount of Federal price support needed to construct the demonstration facility. The Secretary may designate one or more competing entities, each to construct one commercial demonstration facility. Such designation shall be made on the basis of those entities, (A) commitment to construct the demonstration facility at the minimum level of Federal price supports, (B) detailed plan of environmental protection, and (C) proposed design and operation of the demonstration facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The construction plans and actual construction of the demonstration facility, together with all related facilities, shall be monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency. If additional environmental requirements are imposed by the Secretary after the designation of the successful bidders and if such additional environmental requirements result in additional costs, the Secretary is authorized to renegotiate the support price to cover such additional costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The estimated amount of the Federal price support for a demonstration facility's product over the life of such facility shall be determined by the Secretary to facilitate a single congressional authorization of the full amount of such support at the time of the designation of the successful bidders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) No price support program shall be implemented unless previously authorized by specific legislation enacted by the Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Support for joint university-industry research efforts</h4>
