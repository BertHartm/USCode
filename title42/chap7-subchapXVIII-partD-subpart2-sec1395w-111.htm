<p class="statutory-body-2em">PDP sponsors and MA organizations are responsible for the preparation and submission of actuarial valuations required under this part for prescription drug plans and MA&ndash;PD plans they offer.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application of FEHBP standard</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary determines that the portion of the bid submitted under subsection (b) of this section that is attributable to basic prescription drug coverage is supported by the actuarial bases provided under such subsection and reasonably and equitably reflects the revenue requirements (as used for purposes of section 300e&ndash;1(8)(C) of this title) for benefits provided under that plan, less the sum (determined on a monthly per capita basis) of the actuarial value of the reinsurance payments under section 1395w&ndash;115(b) of this title.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2395 --><h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Supplemental coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary determines that the portion of the bid submitted under subsection (b) of this section that is attributable to supplemental prescription drug coverage pursuant to section 1395w&ndash;102(a)(2) of this title is supported by the actuarial bases provided under such subsection and reasonably and equitably reflects the revenue requirements (as used for purposes of section 300e&ndash;1(8)(C) of this title) for such coverage under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Plan design</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary does not find that the design of the plan and its benefits (including any formulary and tiered formulary structure) are likely to substantially discourage enrollment by certain part D eligible individuals under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Use of categories and classes in formularies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may not find that the design of categories and classes within a formulary violates clause (i) if such categories and classes are consistent with guidelines (if any) for such categories and classes established by the United States Pharmacopeia.</p>

In calculating such administrative expenses, the Chief Actuary shall use a factor that is based on similar expenses of prescription drug plans that are not fallback prescription drug plans.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as may be appropriate to carry out this section, the terms and conditions of contracts with eligible fallback entities offering fallback prescription drug plans under this subsection shall be the same as the terms and conditions of contracts under this part for prescription drug plans.</p>
