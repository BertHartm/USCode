<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exclusive property of United States; issuance of patent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any invention is made in the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration, and the Administrator determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the person who made the invention was employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work and the invention is related to the work he was employed or assigned to perform, or that it was within the scope of his employment duties, whether or not it was made during working hours, or with a contribution by the Government of the use of Government facilities, equipment, materials, allocated funds, information proprietary to the Government, or services of Government employees during working hours; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person who made the invention was not employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work, but the invention is nevertheless related to the contract, or to the work or duties he was employed or assigned to perform, and was made during working hours, or with a contribution from the Government of the sort referred to in clause (1),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such invention shall be the exclusive property of the United States, and if such invention is patentable a patent therefor shall be issued to the United States upon application made by the Administrator, unless the Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of the United States to such invention in conformity with the provisions of subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contract provisions for furnishing reports of inventions, discoveries, improvements, or innovations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each contract entered into by the Administrator with any party for the performance of any work shall contain effective provisions under which such party shall furnish promptly to the Administrator a written report containing full and complete technical information concerning any invention, discovery, improvement, or innovation which may be made in the performance of any such work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Patent application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No patent may be issued to any applicant other than the Administrator for any invention which appears to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to have significant utility in the conduct of aeronautical and space activities unless the applicant files with the Commissioner, with the application or within thirty days after request therefor by the Commissioner, a written statement executed under oath setting forth the full facts concerning the circumstances under which such invention was made and stating the relationship (if any) of such invention to the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration. Copies of each such statement and the application to which it relates shall be transmitted forthwith by the Commissioner to the Administrator.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3242 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Issuance of patent to applicant; request by Administrator; notice; hearing; determination; review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon any application as to which any such statement has been transmitted to the Administrator, the Commissioner may, if the invention is patentable, issue a patent to the applicant unless the Administrator, within ninety days after receipt of such application and statement, requests that such patent be issued to him on behalf of the United States. If, within such time, the Administrator files such a request with the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall transmit notice thereof to the applicant, and shall issue such patent to the Administrator unless the applicant within thirty days after receipt of such notice requests a hearing before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the question whether the Administrator is entitled under this section to receive such patent. The Board may hear and determine, in accordance with rules and procedures established for interference cases, the question so presented, and its determination shall be subject to appeal by the applicant or by the Administrator to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in accordance with procedures governing appeals from decisions of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in other proceedings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) False representations; request for transfer of title to patent; notice; hearing; determination; review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any patent has been issued to any applicant in conformity with subsection (d) of this section, and the Administrator thereafter has reason to believe that the statement filed by the applicant in connection therewith contained any false representation of any material fact, the Administrator within five years after the date of issuance of such patent may file with the Commissioner a request for the transfer to the Administrator of title to such patent on the records of the Commissioner. Notice of any such request shall be transmitted by the Commissioner to the owner of record of such patent, and title to such patent shall be so transferred to the Administrator unless within thirty days after receipt of such notice such owner of record requests a hearing before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the question whether any such false representation was contained in such statement. Such question shall be heard and determined, and determination thereof shall be subject to review, in the manner prescribed by subsection (d) of this section for questions arising thereunder. No request made by the Administrator under this subsection for the transfer of title to any patent, and no prosecution for the violation of any criminal statute, shall be barred by any failure of the Administrator to make a request under subsection (d) of this section for the issuance of such patent to him, or by any notice previously given by the Administrator stating that he had no objection to the issuance of such patent to the applicant therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Waiver of rights to inventions; Inventions and Contributions Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under such regulations in conformity with this subsection as the Administrator shall prescribe, he may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States under this section with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or which may be made by any person or class of persons in the performance of any work required by any contract of the Administration if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served thereby. Any such waiver may be made upon such terms and under such conditions as the Administrator shall determine to be required for the protection of the interests of the United States. Each such waiver made with respect to any invention shall be subject to the reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with the United States. Each proposal for any waiver under this subsection shall be referred to an Inventions and Contributions Board which shall be established by the Administrator within the Administration. Such Board shall accord to each interested party an opportunity for hearing, and shall transmit to the Administrator its findings of fact with respect to such proposal and its recommendations for action to be taken with respect thereto.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States commercial launch industry is technically capable of providing reliable and cost efficient access to space and is an essential component of national efforts to assure access to space for Government and commercial users;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Federal Government should encourage, facilitate, and promote the United States commercial launch industry, including the development and enhancement of commercial launch facilities, in order to ensure United States economic preeminence in space;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the interests of the United States will be served if the commercial launch industry is competitive in the international marketplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) commercial vehicles are effective means to challenge foreign competition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the use by the Federal Government of performance specifically in lieu of detailed specifications relating to vehicle design, construction, and operation will facilitate the efficient operation of the United States commercial launch industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the procurement of commercial launch services in a commercially reasonable manner permits a reduced level of Federal Government regulation and oversight and economies of scale which may result in significant cost savings to the commercial launch industry and to the United States.<sup><a href="#2465b_1_target" name="2465b_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) it is the general policy of the Federal Government to purchase needed goods and services, including launch services, from the private sector to the fullest extent feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) predictable access to National Aeronautics and Space Administration launch markets would encourage continuing United States private sector investment in space and related activities.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;Civil Space Employee Testing Act of 1991&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) alcohol abuse and illegal drug use pose significant dangers to the safety and welfare of the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the success of the United States civil space program is contingent upon the safe and successful development and deployment of the many varied components of that program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the greatest efforts must be expended to eliminate the abuse of alcohol and use of illegal drugs, whether on duty or off duty, by those individuals who are involved in the positions affecting safety, security, and national security;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the use of alcohol and illegal drugs has been demonstrated to adversely affect the performance of individuals, and has been proven to have been a critical factor in accidents in the workplace;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the testing of uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces has shown that the most effective deterrent to abuse of alcohol and use of illegal drugs is increased testing, including random testing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) adequate safeguards can be implemented to ensure that testing for abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs is performed in a manner which protects an individual's right of privacy, ensures that no individual is harassed by being treated differently from other individuals, and ensures that no individual's reputation or career development is unduly threatened or harmed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) rehabilitation is a critical component of any testing program for abuse of alcohol or use of illegal drugs, and should be made available to individuals, as appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Testing program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall establish a program applicable to employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration whose duties include responsibility for safety-sensitive, security, or national security functions. Such program shall provide for preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing for use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of alcohol or a controlled substance. The Administrator may also prescribe regulations, as the Administrator considers appropriate in the interest of safety, security, and national security, for the conduct of periodic recurring testing of such employees for such use in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall, in the interest of safety, security, and national security, prescribe regulations within 18 months after December 9, 1991. Such regulations shall establish a program which requires National Aeronautics and Space Administration contractors to conduct preemployment, reasonable suspicion, random, and post-accident testing of contractor employees responsible for safety-sensitive, security, or national security functions (as determined by the Administrator) for use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of alcohol or a controlled substance. The Administrator may also prescribe regulations, as the Administrator considers appropriate in the interest of safety, security, and national security, for the conduct of periodic recurring testing of such employees for such use in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In prescribing regulations under the programs required by this subsection, the Administrator shall require, as the Administrator considers appropriate, the suspension, disqualification, or dismissal of any employee to which paragraph (1) or (2) applies, in accordance with the provisions of this section, in any instance where a test conducted and confirmed under this section indicates that such employee has used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prohibition on service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No individual who is determined by the Administrator under this section to have used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance after December 9, 1991, shall serve as a National Aeronautics and Space Administration employee with responsibility for safety-sensitive, security, or national security functions (as determined by the Administrator), or as a National Aeronautics and Space Administration contractor employee with such responsibility, unless such individual has completed a program of rehabilitation described in subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3263 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Any such individual determined by the Administrator under this section to have used, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, alcohol or a controlled substance after December 9, 1991, who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) engaged in such use while on duty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) prior to such use had undertaken or completed a rehabilitation program described in subsection (e) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) following such determination refuses to undertake such a rehabilitation program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) following such determination fails to complete such a rehabilitation program,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall not be permitted to perform the duties which such individual performed prior to the date of such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Program for rehabilitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall prescribe regulations setting forth requirements for rehabilitation programs which at a minimum provide for the identification and opportunity for treatment of employees referred to in subsection (c) of this section in need of assistance in resolving problems with the use, in violation of applicable law or Federal regulation, of alcohol or a controlled substance. Each contractor is encouraged to make such a program available to all of its employees in addition to those employees referred to in subsection (c)(2) of this section. The Administrator shall determine the circumstances under which such employees shall be required to participate in such a program. Nothing in this subsection shall preclude any National Aeronautics and Space Administration contractor from establishing a program under this subsection in cooperation with any other such contractor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall establish and maintain a rehabilitation program which at a minimum provides for the identification and opportunity for treatment of those employees of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration whose duties include responsibility for safety-sensitive, security, or national security functions who are in need of assistance in resolving problems with the use of alcohol or controlled substances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Procedures for testing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing the programs required under subsection (c) of this section, the Administrator shall develop requirements which shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote, to the maximum extent practicable, individual privacy in the collection of specimen samples;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with respect to laboratories and testing procedures for controlled substances, incorporate the Department of Health and Human Services scientific and technical guidelines dated April 11, 1988, and any subsequent amendments thereto, including mandatory guidelines which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establish comprehensive standards for all aspects of laboratory controlled substances testing and laboratory procedures to be applied in carrying out this section, including standards which require the use of the best available technology for ensuring the full reliability and accuracy of controlled substances tests and strict procedures governing the chain of custody of specimen samples collected for controlled substances testing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) establish the minimum list of controlled substances for which individuals may be tested; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) establish appropriate standards and procedures for periodic review of laboratories and criteria for certification and revocation of certification of laboratories to perform controlled substances testing in carrying out this section;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
