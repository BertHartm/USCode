<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Essential services for maintaining independent living</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congregate services programs assisted under this chapter must include full meal service adequate to meet nutritional needs, and may also include housekeeping aid, personal assistance, and other services essential for maintaining independent living.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Duplication of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No services funded under this chapter may duplicate services which are already affordable, accessible, and sufficiently available on a long-term basis to eligible project residents under programs administered by or receiving appropriations through any department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government or any other public or private department, agency, or organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Consultation with Area Agency on Aging or other appropriate State agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A public housing agency or nonprofit corporation applying for assistance to provide congregate services to elderly residents shall consult with the Area Agency on Aging (or, where no Area Agency on Aging exists, with the appropriate State agency under the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.]) in determining the means of providing services under this chapter and in identifying alternative available sources of funding for such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Submission of proposed application to Area Agency on Aging or other appropriate State agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prior to the submission of a final application for either new or renewed funding under this chapter for the provision of congregate services to elderly residents, a public housing agency and a nonprofit corporation shall present a copy of a proposed application to the Area Agency on Aging (or, where no Area Agency on Aging exists to the appropriate State agency under the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3001 et seq.]) for review and comment. Such agency and nonprofit corporation shall consider such review and comment in the development of any final application for either new or renewed funding under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nonelderly handicapped individuals as eligible project residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A public housing agency or nonprofit corporation applying for assistance to provide congregate services to nonelderly handicapped residents shall consult with the appropriate agency, if any, designated by applicable State law as having responsibility for the development, provision, or identification of social services to permanently disabled adults, for the purpose of determining the means of providing services under this chapter and of identifying alternative available sources of funding for such services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such public housing agency and nonprofit corporation shall also, prior to the submission of a final application for either new or renewed funding under this chapter, present a copy of the proposed application to such appropriate agency for review and comment.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Manner of providing congregate services</h4>

If any contract or lease entered into by a public housing agency or nonprofit corporation pursuant to subsection (f) of this section provides for adjustments in payments for services to reflect changes in the cost of living, then the amount of annual contribution required to be maintained by such public agency or nonprofit corporation under the preceding sentence shall be readjusted in the same manner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fees for meal and other services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each nonprofit corporation and public housing agency shall establish fees for meal service and other appropriate services provided to eligible project residents. These fees shall be reasonable, may not exceed the cost of providing the service, and shall be calculated on a sliding scale related to income which permits the provision of services to such residents who cannot afford meal and service fees. When meal services are provided to other project residents, fees shall be reasonable and may not exceed the cost of providing the meal service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Standards for provision of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish standards for the provision of services under this chapter, and, in developing such service standards, the Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Health and Human Services and with appropriate organizations representing the elderly and handicapped, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and purposes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the effective provision of congregate services may require the redesign of units and buildings to meet the special physical needs of the frail elderly persons and the creation of congregate space to accommodate services that enhance independent living;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) congregate housing, coordinated with the delivery of supportive services, offers an innovative, proven, and cost-effective means of enabling frail older persons and persons with disabilities to maintain their dignity and independence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) independent living with assistance is a preferable housing alternative to institutionalization for many frail older persons and persons with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) 365,000 persons in federally assisted housing experience some form of frailty, and the number is expected to increase as the general population ages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) an estimated 20 to 30 percent of older adults living in federally assisted housing experience some form of frailty;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a large and growing number of frail elderly residents face premature or unnecessary institutionalization because of the absence of or deficiencies in the availability, adequacy, coordination, or delivery of supportive services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the support service needs of frail residents of assisted housing are beyond the resources and experience that housing managers have for meeting such needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) supportive services would promote the invaluable option of independent living for nonelderly persons with disabilities in federally assisted housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) approximately 25 percent of congregate housing services program sites provide congregate services to young individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) to the extent that institutionalized older adults do not need the full costly support provided by such care, public moneys could be more effectively spent providing the necessary services in a noninstitutional setting; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) the Congregate Housing Services Program, established by Congress in 1978, and similar programs providing in-home services have been effective in preventing unnecessary institutionalization and encouraging deinstitutionalization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purposes of this section are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide assistance to retrofit individual dwelling units and renovate public and common areas in eligible housing to meet the special physical needs of eligible residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to create and rehabilitate congregate space in or adjacent to such housing to accommodate supportive services that enhance independent living;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to improve the capacity of management to assess the service needs of eligible residents, coordinate the provision of supportive services that meet the needs of eligible residents and ensure the long-term provision of such services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to provide services in federally assisted housing to prevent premature and inappropriate institutionalization in a manner that respects the dignity of the elderly and persons with disabilities;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6001 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to provide readily available and efficient supportive services that provide a choice in supported living arrangements by utilizing the services of an on-site coordinator, with emphasis on maintaining a continuum of care for the vulnerable elderly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to improve the quality of life of older Americans living in federally assisted housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) to preserve the viability of existing affordable housing projects for lower-income older residents who are aging in place by assisting managers of such housing with the difficulties and challenges created by serving older residents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) to develop partnerships between the Federal Government and State governments in providing services to the frail elderly and persons with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) to utilize Federal and State funds in a more cost-effective and humane way in serving the needs of older adults.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to establish a demonstration program to test the effectiveness of combining housing certificates and vouchers with supportive services to assist frail elderly persons to continue to live independently. The demonstration program under this section shall terminate upon the expiration of the 5-year period determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Housing assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In connection with this demonstration, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may enter into contracts with public housing agencies to provide not more than 1,500 incremental vouchers and certificates under sections 1437f(b) and 1437f(<em>o</em>) of this title. A public housing agency may not require that a frail elderly person live in a particular structure or unit, but the agency may restrict the program under this section to a geographic area, where necessary to ensure that the provision of supportive services is feasible. At the end of the demonstration period, the public housing agency shall give each frail elderly person the option to continue to receive assistance under the housing certificate or <!-- PDFPage:6009 -->voucher program of the agency. In the demonstration, the Secretary may also provide for supportive services in connection with existing contracts for housing assistance under sections 1437f(b) and 1437f(<em>o</em>) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Supportive services requirements and matching funding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal, PHA and,<sup><a href="#8012_1_target" name="8012_1">1</a></sup> individual contributions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Secretary shall provide 40 percent, using amounts appropriated under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The public housing agency shall ensure the provision of at least 50 percent from sources other than under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, each frail elderly person shall pay 10 percent of the costs of the supportive services that the person receives, except that a frail elderly person may not be required to pay an amount that exceeds 20 percent of the adjusted income (as the term is defined in section 1437a(b)(5) of this title) of such person and the Secretary shall provide for the waiver of the requirement to pay costs under this subparagraph for persons whose income is determined to be insufficient to provide for any payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) To the extent that the limitation under subparagraph (C) regarding the percentage of income frail elderly persons may pay for services will result in collected amounts for any public housing agency of less than 10 percent of the cost of providing the services, 50 percent of such remaining costs shall be provided by the public housing agency and 50 percent of such remaining costs shall be provided by the Secretary from amounts appropriated under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Provision of services for entire demonstration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency shall ensure that supportive services appropriate to the needs of the frail elderly persons to be served under this demonstration are provided throughout the demonstration period. Expenditures for supportive services need not be made in equal amounts for each year, but may vary depending on the needs of the frail elderly persons assisted under this section. A public housing agency may use up to 20 percent of the Federal assistance provided for supportive services in each year of this demonstration and any amounts from any prior year in which the public housing agency did not use 20 percent of the available Federal assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Calculation of match</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining compliance with paragraph (1)(B), an agency may include the value of such items as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, which may include the salary paid to staff to provide supportive services, if such items have a readily discernible market value.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the supportive services will be provided for the demonstration period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the plan for coordinating the provision of housing assistance and supportive services;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall periodically establish development cost limitations by market area for various types and sizes of supportive housing for persons with disabilities by publishing a notice of the cost limitations in the Federal Register. The cost limitations shall reflect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of supportive housing for persons with disabilities that (i) meets applicable State and local housing and building codes; and (ii) conforms with the design characteristics of the neighborhood in which it is to be located;</p>

Neither this section nor any other provision of law may be construed as prohibiting or preventing the location and operation, in a project assisted under this section, of commercial facilities for the benefit of residents of the project and the community in which the project is located, except that assistance made available under this section may not be used to subsidize any such commercial facility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) RTC properties</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice of appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall notify an owner not less than 30 days prior to canceling any reservation of assistance provided under this section.
