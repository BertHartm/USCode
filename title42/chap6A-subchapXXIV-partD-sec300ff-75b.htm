<p class="statutory-body">After consultation with the States, with eligible areas under part A of this subchapter, and with entities that receive amounts from grants under part A or B of this subchapter, the Secretary shall develop a plan for coordinating the disbursement of appropriations for grants under part A of this subchapter with the disbursement of appropriations for grants under part B of this subchapter in order to assist grantees and other recipients of amounts from such grants in complying with the requirements of such parts. The Secretary shall submit the plan to the Congress not later than 18 months after October 20, 2000.

The Secretary shall submit such determination to the Congress not later than 2 years after October 20, 2000.</p>
