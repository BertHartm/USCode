<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Studies and investigations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director is authorized to undertake and carry out such studies and investigations and receive or exchange such information as may be necessary to estimate, and shall from time to time estimate, on an area, subdivision, or other appropriate basis&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the risk premium rates for flood insurance which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) based on consideration of the risk involved and accepted actuarial principles, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the applicable operating costs and allowances set forth in the schedules prescribed under section 4018 of this title and reflected in such rates,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any administrative expenses (or portion of such expenses) of carrying out the flood insurance program which, in his discretion, should properly be reflected in such rates, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any remaining administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the flood insurance and floodplain management programs (including the costs of mapping activities under section 4101 of this title) not included under clause (ii), which shall be recovered by a fee charged to policyholders and such fee shall not be subject to any agents&rsquo; commissions, company expense allowances, or State or local premium taxes,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">would be required in order to make such insurance available on an actuarial basis for any <!-- PDFPage:5173 -->types and classes of properties for which insurance coverage is available under section 4012(a) of this title (or is recommended to the Congress under section 4012(b) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rates, if less than the rates estimated under paragraph (1), which would be reasonable, would encourage prospective insureds to purchase flood insurance, and would be consistent with the purposes of this chapter, and which, together with a fee charged to policyholders that shall not be not subject to any agents&rsquo; commission, company expenses allowances, or State or local premium taxes, shall include any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the flood insurance and floodplain management programs (including the costs of mapping activities under section 4101 of this title); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent, if any, to which federally assisted or other flood protection measures initiated after August 1, 1968, affect such rates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Utilization of services of other Departments and agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out subsection (a) of this section, the Director shall, to the maximum extent feasible and on a reimbursement basis, utilize the services of the Department of the Army, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, and, as appropriate, other Federal departments or agencies, and for such purposes may enter into agreements or other appropriate arrangements with any persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority to studies and investigations in States or areas evidencing positive interest in securing insurance under program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall give priority to conducting studies and investigations and making estimates under this section in those States or areas (or subdivisions thereof) which he has determined have evidenced a positive interest in securing flood insurance coverage under the flood insurance program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Parishes of Louisiana; premium rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any structure existing on December 31, 1973, and located within Avoyelles, Evangeline, Rapides, or Saint Landry Parish in the State of Louisiana, which the Secretary determines is subject to additional flood hazards as a result of the construction or operation of the Atchafalaya Basin Levee System, shall be eligible for flood insurance under this chapter (if and to the extent it is eligible for such insurance under the other provisions of this chapter) at premium rates that shall not exceed those which would be applicable if such additional hazards did not exist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Eligibility of community making adequate progress on construction of flood protection system for rates not exceeding those applicable to completed flood protection system; determination of adequate progress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any community that has made adequate progress, acceptable to the Director, on the construction of a flood protection system which will afford flood protection for the one-hundred year frequency flood as determined by the Director, shall be eligible for flood insurance under this chapter (if and to the extent it is eligible for such insurance under the other provisions of this chapter) at premium rates not exceeding those which would be applicable under this section if such flood protection system had been completed. The Director shall find that adequate progress on the construction of a flood protection system as required herein has been only if (1) 100 percent of the project cost of the system has been authorized, (2) at least 60 percent of the project cost of the system has been appropriated, (3) at least 50 percent of the project cost of the system has been expended, and (4) the system is at least 50 percent completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Availability of flood insurance in communities restoring disaccredited flood protection systems; criteria; rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this subsection shall only apply in a community which has been determined by the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be in the process of restoring flood protection afforded by a flood protection system that had been previously accredited on a Flood Insurance Rate Map as providing 100-year frequency flood protection but no longer does so. Except as provided in this subsection, in such a community, flood insurance shall be made available to those properties impacted by the disaccreditation of the flood protection system at premium rates that do not exceed those which would be applicable to any property located in an area of special flood hazard, the construction of which was started prior to the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the Director for the community in which such property is located. A revised Flood Insurance Rate Map shall be prepared for the community to delineate as Zone AR the areas of special flood hazard that result from the disaccreditation of the flood protection system. A community will be considered to be in the process of restoration if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a Federal agency in consultation with the local project sponsor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a minimum level of flood protection is still provided to the community by the disaccredited system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) restoration of the flood protection system is scheduled to occur within a designated time period and in accordance with a progress plan negotiated between the community and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Communities that the Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency determines to meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) as of January 1, 1992, shall not be subject to revised Flood Insurance Rate Maps that contravene the intent of this subsection. Such communities shall remain eligible for C zone rates for properties located in zone AR for any policy written prior to promulgation of final regulations for this section. Floodplain management criteria for such communities shall not require the elevation of improvements to ex<!-- PDFPage:5174 -->isting structures and shall not exceed 3 feet above existing grade for new construction, provided the base flood elevation based on the disaccredited flood control system does not exceed five feet above existing grade, or the remaining new construction in such communities is limited to infill sites, rehabilitation of existing structures, or redevelopment of previously developed areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall develop and promulgate regulations to implement this subsection, including minimum floodplain management criteria, within 24 months after October 28, 1992.</p>
