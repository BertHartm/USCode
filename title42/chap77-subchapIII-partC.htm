<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Utilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the project produces net excess power and an electric utility purchases or transmits the excess power, 50 percent of so much of the grant as is attributable to the net excess power shall be paid to the electric utility purchasing or transporting the net excess power.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Useful thermal energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of waste energy recovery that produces useful thermal energy that is used for a purpose different from that for which the project is principally designed, a grant under this section shall be made to the owner or operator of the waste energy recovery project at <!-- PDFPage:5881 -->the rate of $10 for each 3,412,000 Btus of the excess thermal energy used for the different purpose.</p>
