<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 105&ndash;168, &sect;1(b), Apr. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 43, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality, directly responsible for one out of every five infant deaths.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Thousands of the 150,000 infants born with a serious birth defect annually face a lifetime of chronic disability and illness.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Birth defects threaten the lives of infants of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, some conditions pose excess risks for certain populations. For example, compared to all infants born in the United States, Hispanic-American infants are more likely to be born with anencephaly spina bifida and other neural tube defects and African-American infants are more likely to be born with sickle-cell anemia.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Birth defects can be caused by exposure to environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Prevention efforts are slowed by lack of information about the number and causes of birth defects. Outbreaks of birth defects may go undetected because surveillance and research efforts are underdeveloped and poorly coordinated.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:180 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Public awareness strategies, such as programs using folic acid vitamin supplements to prevent spina bifida and alcohol avoidance programs to prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, are essential to prevent the heartache and costs associated with birth defects.&rdquo;</p>
