<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As soon as practicable after December 19, 2007, the Secretary of Energy shall establish a program to determine ways in which the weight of motor vehicles could be reduced to improve fuel efficiency without compromising passenger safety by conducting research, development, and demonstration relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the development of new materials (including cast metal composite materials formed by autocombustion synthesis) and material processes that yield a higher strength-to-weight ratio or other properties that reduce vehicle weight; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reducing the cost of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) lightweight materials (including high-strength steel alloys, aluminum, magnesium, metal composites, and carbon fiber reinforced polymer composites) with the properties required for construction of lighter-weight vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) materials processing, automated manufacturing, joining, and recycling lightweight materials for high-volume applications.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this section $80,000,000 for the period of fiscal years 2008 through 2012.</p>
