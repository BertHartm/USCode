<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Projects for economic recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the purposes of this subchapter the President is authorized to provide technical assistance which would be useful in facilitating economic recovery in areas affected by major disasters. Such assistance shall include project planning and feasibility studies, management and operational assistance, and studies evaluating the needs of, and developing potentialities for, economic recovery of such areas. Such assistance may be provided by the President directly, through the payment of funds authorized for this subchapter to other departments or agencies of the Federal Government, through the employment of private individuals, partnerships, firms, corporations, or suitable institutions, under contracts entered into for such purposes, or through grants-in-aid to appropriate public or private nonprofit State, area, district, or local organizations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Grants for Federal share of administrative expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to make grants to defray not to exceed 75 per centum of the administrative expenses of Recovery Planning Councils designated pursuant to section 3232 of this <!-- PDFPage:3180 -->title. In determining the amount of the non-Federal share of such costs or expenses, the President shall give due consideration to all contributions both in cash and in kind, fairly evaluated, including but not limited to space, equipment, and services. Where practicable, grants-in-aid authorized under this subsection shall be used in conjunction with other available planning grants, to assure adequate and effective planning and economical use of funds.</p>
