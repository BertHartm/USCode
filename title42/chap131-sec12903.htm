<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Allocation of resources</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Formula allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall allocate 90 percent of the amounts approved in appropriation Acts under section 12912 of this title among States and cities whose most recent comprehensive housing affordability strategy (or abbreviated strategy) has been approved by the Secretary under section 12705 of this title.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A single city may receive assistance allocated under subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B). For purposes of allocating amounts under this paragraph for any fiscal year, the number of cases of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome shall be the number of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control of the Public Health Service as of March 31 of the fiscal year immediately preceding the fiscal year for which the amounts are appropriated and to be allocated.</p>

If allocation under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1) would allocate less than $200,000 for any State, the allocation for such State shall be $200,000 and the amount of the increase under this sentence shall be deducted on a pro rata basis from the allocations of the other States, except that a reduction under this subparagraph may not reduce the amount allocated to any eligible entity to less than $200,000.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Selection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In selecting projects under this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider (i) relative numbers of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome cases and per capita acquired immunodeficiency syndrome incidence; (ii) housing needs of eligible persons in the community; (iii) extent of local planning and coordination of housing programs for eligible persons; and (iv) the likelihood of the continuation of State and local efforts.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) National significance projects</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional requirement for city formula grantees</h4>
