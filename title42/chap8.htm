Any contract for such loans and any amendment to a contract for such loans shall provide that such loans shall bear interest at a rate specified by the Secretary which shall not be less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, plus one-eighth of 1 per centum. Such loans shall be secured in such manner and shall be repaid within such period not exceeding forty years, or not exceeding forty years from the date of the bonds evidencing the loan, as the <!-- PDFPage:2175 -->Secretary may determine. The Secretary may require loans or commitments to make loans under this section to be pledged as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency in connection with a low-income housing project.</p>

For the purpose of determining obligations incurred to make loans pursuant to this chapter against any limitation otherwise applicable with respect to such loans, the Secretary shall estimate the maximum amount to be loaned at any one time pursuant to loan agreements then outstanding with public housing agencies. Such notes or other obligations shall be in such forms and denominations and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. The notes or other obligations issued under this subsection shall have such maturities and bear such rate or rates of interest as shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes or other obligations of the Secretary issued hereunder and for such purpose is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchases of such obligations.

Such cancellation shall not affect any other terms and conditions of such contract, which shall remain in effect as if the cancellation had not occurred. This paragraph shall not apply to any loan the repayment of which was not to be made using annual contributions, or to any loan all or part of the proceeds of which are due a public housing agency from contractors or others.</p>

Annual contributions payable under this section shall be pledged, if the Secretary so requires, as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency to assist the development or acquisition of the project to which annual contributions relate and shall be paid over a period not to exceed 40 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make contributions (in the form of grants) to public housing agencies to cover the development cost of public housing projects.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of contributions that would be established for a newly constructed project by a public housing agency designed to accommodate a number of families of a given size and kind may be established under this section for a project by such public housing agency that would provide housing for the comparable number, sizes, and kinds of families through the acquisition and rehabilitation, or use under lease, of structures that are suitable for low-income housing use and obtained in the local market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Maximum amount of contributions; regulations; criteria for rates of contribution</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:2178 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Scope of contracts for loans or annual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract for loans or annual contributions, or both, entered into by the Secretary with a public housing agency, may cover one or more than one low-income housing project owned by such public housing agency; in the event the contract covers two or more projects, such projects may, for any of the purposes of this chapter and of such contract (including, but not limited to, the determination of the amount of the loan, annual contributions, or payments in lieu of taxes, specified in such contract), be treated collectively as one project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Local determination of need as prerequisite for contracts for preliminary loans, and contracts for loans or annual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In recognition that there should be local determination of the need for low-income housing to meet needs not being adequately met by private enterprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary shall not make any contract with a public housing agency for preliminary loans (all of which shall be repaid out of any moneys which become available to such agency for the development of the projects involved) for surveys and planning in respect to any low-income housing projects (i) unless the governing body of the locality involved has by resolution approved the application of the public housing agency for such preliminary loan; and (ii) unless the public housing agency has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is need for such low-income housing which is not being met by private enterprise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary shall not make any contract for loans (other than preliminary loans) or for contributions pursuant to this chapter unless the governing body of the locality involved has entered into an agreement with the public housing agency providing for the local cooperation required by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Modification by Secretary of terms of contracts, etc.; limitations; amendment or supersedure of contracts for annual contributions or loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the specific limitations or standards in this chapter governing the terms of sales, rentals, leases, loans, contracts for annual contributions, or other agreements, the Secretary may, whenever he deems it necessary or desirable in the fulfillment of the purposes of this chapter, consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of any installment of principal or interest, security, amount of annual contribution, or any other term, of any contract or agreement of any kind to which the Secretary is a party. When the Secretary finds that it would promote economy or be in the financial interest of the Federal Government or is necessary to assure or maintain the lower income character of the project or projects involved, any contract heretofore or hereafter made for annual contributions, loans, or both, may be amended or superseded by a contract entered into by mutual agreement between the public housing agency and the Secretary. Contracts may not be amended or superseded in a manner which would impair the rights of the holders of any outstanding obligations of the public housing agency involved for which annual contributions have been pledged. Any rule of law contrary to this provision shall be deemed inapplicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Pledge of annual contributions as guarantee of payment of obligations issued by public housing agency; exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authority of the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section to pledge annual contributions as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency, the Secretary is authorized to pledge annual contributions as a guarantee of payment by a public housing agency of all principal and interest on obligations issued by it to assist the development or acquisition of the project to which the annual contributions relate, except that no obligation shall be guaranteed under this subsection if the income thereon is exempt from Federal taxation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Sale of project to lower income tenants by public housing agency; terms and conditions; commitment by Secretary to pay annual contribution unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a public housing agency may sell a low-income housing project to its lower income tenants, on such terms and conditions as the agency may determine, without affecting the Secretary's commitment to pay annual contributions with respect to that project, but such contributions shall not exceed the maximum contributions authorized under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the Secretary makes such reservation under paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may reserve not more than 20 percent of any amounts appropriated for development of public housing in each fiscal year for the substantial redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment of existing obsolete public housing projects or buildings and for the costs of improving the management and operation of projects undergoing redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment under this paragraph (to the extent that such improvement is necessary to maintain the physical improvements resulting from such redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;obsolete public housing project or building&rdquo; means a public housing project or building (i) having design or marketability problems resulting in vacancy in more than 25 percent of the units, or (ii)(I) for which the costs for redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment (including any costs for lead-based paint abatement activities) exceed 70 percent of the total development cost limits for new construction of similar units in the area, and (II) which has an occupancy density or a building height that is significantly in excess of that which prevails in the neighborhood in which the project is located, a bedroom configuration that could be altered to better serve the needs of families seeking occupancy to dwellings of the public housing agency, significant security problems in and around the project, or significant physical deterioration or inefficient energy and utility systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall allocate amounts reserved under this section to public housing agencies on the basis of a competition among public housing agencies applying for such amounts. The competition shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the management capability of the public housing agency to carry out the redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the expected term of the useful life of the project or building after redesign, reconstruction or redevelopment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the likelihood of achieving full occupancy within the projects or buildings of the agency that are to be assisted under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall establish limitations on the total costs of any project or building receiving amounts under this paragraph for redesign, reconstruction, and redevelopment. The cost limitations shall not be related to the total development cost system for new development or to the cost limits for modernization and shall recognize the higher direct costs of such work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Assistance may not be provided under this paragraph for any project or building assisted under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) For each fiscal year for which amounts are reserved or appropriated for the purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall establish performance goals to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of such amounts. The goals shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) be designed to maximize the effectiveness of the expenditures in a quantifiable manner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) describe the number of units to be redesigned, redeveloped, and reconstructed with such amounts and improvements in the management of projects so assisted to be accomplished with such amounts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Not later than 60 days after the end of each such fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress, which shall describe the performance goals established for the fiscal year, the activities carried out with such amounts, and a statement of whether the performance goals were met. If the performance goals were not met, the report shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) an explanation of why the goals were not met and a description of any managerial deficiencies or legal problems that contributed to not meeting such goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) plans and a schedule for achieving the level of performance under such performance goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes necessary to achieve the performance goals or improve performance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) a statement of whether the performance goals established for the fiscal year were impractical or infeasible, and, if so, the factors that contributed and resulted in establishing such impractical or infeasible goals and recommendations of actions to meet such goals, which may include changing the goals or altering or eliminating the program under this paragraph for major reconstruction of projects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary shall commit for use under clause (ii) not less than 5 percent of any amounts reserved under subparagraph (A) for each such fiscal year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2180 --><p class="statutory-body">(ii) The amounts referred to in clause (i) shall be available to public housing agencies only for use for projects (or portions of projects) designated for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) and (e) of this title by disabled families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In allocating amounts reserved under this subparagraph among public housing agencies, the Secretary shall consider the need for any such amounts as identified in the allocation plans submitted by agencies under section 1437e(f) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary shall reserve for use under subparagraph (B) not less than 5 percent of any amounts approved in appropriation Acts for each such fiscal year for public housing grants under subsection (a)(2) of this section that are not designated under such Acts for use under paragraph (2) of this subsection for the substantial redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment of existing public housing projects, buildings, or units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any amount reserved under subparagraph (A) shall be available only to public housing agencies that have designated projects (or portions of projects) for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) of this title for use only for the costs of development or acquisition of public housing projects or buildings designated for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) and (e) of this title by disabled families. A building so assisted may not contain more than 25 dwelling units, except that the Secretary may (in the discretion of the Secretary) waive such limitation for a building.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall carry out a competition for budget authority reserved under subparagraph (A) among eligible public housing agencies and shall allocate such budget authority to public housing agencies pursuant to the competition, based on (i) the need of the agency for such assistance (taking into consideration the allocation plans submitted under section 1437e(f) of this title by agencies), and (ii) the extent to which the public housing projects and buildings to be developed or assisted meet the requirements of section 1437e(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Limitation on recapture of funding reservations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the reservation of public housing development funds to a public housing agency, the Secretary may not recapture any of the amounts included in such reservation due to the failure of a public housing agency to begin construction or rehabilitation, or to complete acquisition, during the 30-month period following the date of such reservation. During such 30-month period, the public housing agency shall be permitted to change the site of the public housing project or reformulate the project, if not less than the original number of dwelling units are to be constructed, rehabilitated, or acquired. There shall be excluded from the computation of such 30-month period any delay in the beginning of construction or rehabilitation of such project caused by (1) the failure of the Secretary to process such project within a reasonable period of time; (2) any environmental review requirement; (3) any legal action affecting such project; or (4) any other factor beyond the control of the public housing agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Indian public housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not use as a criterion for distributing assistance under this section the progress made by an Indian public housing agency in collecting rents owed by tenants unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such criterion is used as 1 of several criteria that are weighted proportionally and is established by regulations issued after public notice and opportunity to comment in accordance with section 553 of title 5; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary determines that the Indian public housing agency has demonstrated a pattern of substantial noncompliance with requirements governing the collection of rents.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in any contract for loans, contributions, sale, lease, mortgage, or any other agreement or instrument made pursuant to this chapter, such covenants, conditions, or provisions as he may deem necessary in order to insure the lower income character of the project involved. Any such contract may contain a condition requiring the maintenance of an open space or playground in connection with the housing project involved if deemed necessary by the Secretary for the safety or health of children. Any such contract shall require that, except in the case of housing predominantly for elderly or disabled families, high-rise elevator projects shall not be provided for families with children unless the Secretary makes a determination that there is no practical alternative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Public housing for Indians and Alaska Natives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contract for loans (other than preliminary loans) or contributions for the development, acquisition, or operation of public housing and public housing for Indians and Alaska Natives in accordance with the Indian Housing Act of 1988 [42 U.S.C. 1437aa et seq.] shall provide that the total development cost of the project on which the computation of any annual contributions under this chapter may be based may not exceed the amount determined under paragraph (2) (for the appropriate structure type) unless the Secretary provides otherwise, and in any case may not exceed 110 per centum of such amount unless the Secretary for good cause determines otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine the total development cost by multiplying the construction cost guideline for the project (which shall be determined by averaging the current construction costs, as listed by not less than 2 nationally recognized residential construction cost indices, for publicly bid construction of a good and sound quality) by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions shall provide that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the public housing agency shall promptly notify (i) any applicant determined to be ineligible for admission to the project of the basis for such determination and provide the applicant upon request, within a reasonable time after the determination is made, with an opportunity for an informal hearing on such determination, and (ii) any applicant determined to be eligible for admission to the project of the approximate date of occupancy insofar as such date can be reasonably determined; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for not less than 50 percent of the units that are made available for occupancy in a given fiscal year, give preference to families that occupy substandard housing (including families that are homeless or living in a shelter for homeless families), are paying more than 50 percent of family income for rent, or are involuntarily displaced (including displacement because of disposition of a multifamily housing project under section 1701z&ndash;11 of title 12) at the time they are seeking assistance under this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for any remaining units to be made available for occupancy, give preference in accordance with a system of preferences established by the public housing agency in writing and after public hearing to respond to local housing needs and priorities, which may include (I) assisting very low-income families who either reside in transitional housing assisted under title IV of the Stewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 11361 et seq.], or participate in a program designed to provide public assistance recipients with greater access to employment and educational opportunities; (II) assisting families in accordance with subsection (u)(2);&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437d_1_target" name="1437d_1">1</a></sup> (III) assisting families identified by local public agencies involved in providing for the welfare of children as having a lack of adequate housing that is a primary factor <!-- PDFPage:2184 -->in the imminent placement of a child in foster care, or in preventing the discharge of a child from foster care and reunification with his or her family; (IV) assisting youth, upon discharge from foster care, in cases in which return to the family or extended family or adoption is not available; (V) assisting families that include one or more adult members who are employed; and (VI) achieving other objectives of national housing policy as affirmed by Congress; subclause (V) shall be effective only during fiscal year 1995;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) are designed to ensure that, to the maximum extent feasible, the projects of an agency will include families with a broad range of incomes and will avoid concentrations of low-income and deprived families with serious social problems.<sup><a href="#1437d_3_target" name="1437d_3">3</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of satisfactory procedures designed to assure the prompt payment and collection of rents and the prompt processing of evictions in the case of nonpayment of rent;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) requiring the public housing agency to ensure and maintain compliance with subtitle C of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13601 et seq.] and any regulations issued under such subtitle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exemption from personal and real property taxes; payments in lieu of taxes; cash contribution or tax remission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions with respect to a low-income housing project shall provide that no contributions by the Secretary shall be made available for such project unless such project (exclusive of any portion thereof which is not assisted by contributions under this chapter) is exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by the State, city, county, or other political subdivision; and such contract shall require the public housing agency to make payments in lieu of taxes equal to 10 per centum of the sum of the shelter rents charged in such project, or such lesser amount as (i) is prescribed by State law, or (ii) is agreed to by the local governing body in its agreement for local cooperation with the public housing agency required under section 1437c(e)(2) of this title, or (iii) is due to failure of a local public body or bodies other than the public housing agency to perform any obligation under such agreement. If any such project is not exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by the State, city, county, or other political subdivision, such contract shall provide, in lieu of the requirement for tax exemption and payments in lieu of taxes, that no contributions by the Secretary shall be made available for such project unless and until the State, city, county, or other political subdivision in which such project is situated shall contribute, in the form of cash or tax remission, the amount by which the taxes paid with respect to the project exceed 10 per centum of the shelter rents charged in such project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Excess funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for annual contributions shall provide that whenever in any year the receipts of a public housing agency in connection with a low-income housing project exceed its expenditures (including debt service, operation, maintenance, establishment of reserves, and other costs and charges), an amount equal to such excess shall be applied, or set aside for application, to purposes, which, in the determination of the Secretary, will effect a reduction in the amount of subsequent annual contributions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Substantial default; conveyance of title and delivery of possession; reconveyance and redelivery; payments for outstanding obligations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall develop and publish in the Federal Register indicators to assess the management performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations. The indicators shall be established by rule under section 553 of title 5. Such indicators shall enable the Secretary to evaluate the performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations in all major areas of management operations. The Secretary shall, in particular, use the following indicators for public housing agencies, to the extent practicable:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) The Secretary shall, under the rulemaking procedures under section 553 of title 5, establish procedures for designating troubled public housing agencies, which procedures shall include identification of serious and substantial failure to perform as measured by the performance indicators specified under paragraph (1) and such other factors as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate.

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency's performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), the assessment team shall also consider issues relating to the agency's resident population and physical inventory, including the extent to which (I) the agency's comprehensive plan prepared pursuant to section 1437<em>l</em> of this title adequately and appropriately addresses the rehabilitation needs of the agency's inventory, (II) residents of the agency are involved in and informed of significant management decisions, and (III) any projects in the agency's inventory are severely distressed and eligible for assistance pursuant to section 1437v of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) An independent assessment under this subparagraph shall be carried out by a team of knowledgeable individuals selected by the Secretary (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;assessment team&rdquo;) with expertise in public housing and real estate management.

<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency's performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), such agreement shall also set forth a plan for enhancing resident involvement in the management of the public housing agency.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1437f. Low-income housing assistance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of aiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing, assistance payments may be made with respect to existing housing in accordance with the provisions of this section. A public housing agency may contract to make assistance payments to itself (or any agency or instrumentality thereof) as the owner of dwelling units if such agency is subject to the same program requirements as are applied to other owners. In such cases, the Secretary may establish initial rents within applicable limits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rental certificates and other existing housing programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">[(1)]&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_1_target" name="1437f_1">1</a></sup> The Secretary is authorized to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies pursuant to which such agencies may enter into contracts to make assistance payments to owners of existing dwelling units in accordance with this section. The Secretary shall enter into a separate annual contributions contract with each public housing agency to obligate the authority approved each year, beginning with the authority approved in appropriations Acts for fiscal year 1988 (other than amendment authority to increase assistance payments being made using authority approved prior to the appropriations Acts for fiscal year 1988), and such annual contributions contract (other than for annual contributions under subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section) shall bind the Secretary to make such authority, and any amendments increasing such authority, available to the public housing agency for a specified period. In areas where no public housing agency has been organized or where the Secretary determines that a public housing agency is unable to implement the provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized to enter into such contracts and to perform the other functions assigned to a public housing agency by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_1_target" name="1437f_1">1</a></sup> The Secretary is authorized to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies for the purpose of replacing public housing transferred in accordance with subchapter II&ndash;A of this chapter. Each contract entered into under this subsection shall be for a term of not more than 60 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contents and purposes of contracts for assistance payments; amount and scope of monthly assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An assistance contract entered into pursuant to this section shall establish the maximum monthly rent (including utilities and all maintenance and management charges) which the owner is entitled to receive for each dwelling unit with respect to which such assistance payments are to be made. The maximum monthly rent shall not exceed by more than 10 per centum the fair market rental established by the Secretary periodically but not less than annually for existing or newly constructed rental dwelling units of various sizes and types in the market area suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under this section, except that the maximum monthly rent may exceed the fair market rental (A) by more than 10 but not more than 20 per centum where the Secretary determines that special circumstances warrant such higher maximum rent or that such higher rent is necessary to the implementation of a housing strategy as defined in section 12705 of this title, or (B) by such higher amount as may be requested by a <!-- PDFPage:2195 -->tenant and approved by the public housing agency in accordance with paragraph (3)(B). In the case of newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated units, the exception in the preceding sentence shall not apply to more than 20 per centum of the total amount of authority to enter into annual contributions contracts for such units which is allocated to an area and obligated with respect to any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1980. Proposed fair market rentals for an area shall be published in the Federal Register with reasonable time for public comment, and shall become effective upon the date of publication in final form in the Federal Register. Each fair market rental in effect under this subsection shall be adjusted to be effective on October 1 of each year to reflect changes, based on the most recent available data trended so the rentals will be current for the year to which they apply, of rents for existing or newly constructed rental dwelling units, as the case may be, of various sizes and types in the market area suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, after October 12, 1977, the Secretary shall prohibit high-rise elevator projects for families with children unless there is no practical alternative. The Secretary shall establish separate fair market rentals under this paragraph for Westchester County in the State of New York. The Secretary shall also establish separate fair market rentals under this paragraph for Monroe County in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In establishing fair market rentals for the remaining portion of the market area in which Monroe County is located, the Secretary shall establish the fair market rentals as if such portion included Monroe County. If units assisted under this section are exempt from local rent control while they are so assisted or otherwise, the maximum monthly rent for such units shall be reasonable in comparison with other units in the market area that are exempt from local rent control.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The assistance contract shall provide for adjustment annually or more frequently in the maximum monthly rents for units covered by the contract to reflect changes in the fair market rentals established in the housing area for similar types and sizes of dwelling units or, if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a reasonable formula. However, where the maximum monthly rent, for a unit in a new construction, substantial rehabilitation, or moderate rehabilitation project, to be adjusted using an annual adjustment factor exceeds the fair market rental for an existing dwelling unit in the market area, the Secretary shall adjust the rent only to the extent that the owner demonstrates that the adjusted rent would not exceed the rent for an unassisted unit of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, as determined by the Secretary. The immediately foregoing sentence shall be effective only during fiscal year 1995. For any unit occupied by the same family at the time of the last annual rental adjustment, where the assistance contract provides for the adjustment of the maximum monthly rent by applying an annual adjustment factor and where the rent for a unit is otherwise eligible for an adjustment based on the full amount of the factor, 0.01 shall be subtracted from the amount of the factor, except that the factor shall not be reduced to less than 1.0. The immediately foregoing sentence shall be effective only during fiscal year 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The contract shall further provide for the Secretary to make additional adjustments in the maximum monthly rent for units under contract to the extent he determines such adjustments are necessary to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the units which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, utility rates, or similar costs which are not adequately compensated for by the adjustment in the maximum monthly rent authorized by subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall make additional adjustments in the maximum monthly rent for units under contract (subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments) to the extent the Secretary determines such adjustments are necessary to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the units that have resulted from the expiration of a real property tax exemption. Where the Secretary determines that a project assisted under this section is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent and the project's operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have been substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity, the Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments for this purpose), on a project by project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the project rents, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs, and reserves required for the owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to the Secretary for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity. Any rent comparability standard required under this paragraph may be waived by the Secretary to so implement the preceding sentence. The Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments), on a project by project basis for projects receiving project-based assistance, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents to cover the costs of evaluating and reducing lead-based paint hazards, as defined in section 4851b of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Adjustments in the maximum rents under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, as determined by the Secretary. In implementing the limitation established under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall establish regulations for conducting comparability studies for projects where the Secretary has reason to believe that the application of the formula adjustments under subparagraph (A) would result in such material differences. The Secretary shall conduct such studies upon the request of any owner of any project, or as the Secretary determines to be appropriate by establishing, to the extent practicable, a modified annual adjust<!-- PDFPage:2196 -->ment factor for such market area, as the Secretary shall designate, that is geographically smaller than the applicable housing area used for the establishment of the annual adjustment factor under subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall establish such modified annual adjustment factor on the basis of the results of a study conducted by the Secretary of the rents charged, and any change in such rents over the previous year, for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the smaller market area. Where the Secretary determines that such modified annual adjustment factor cannot be established or that such factor when applied to a particular project would result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, the Secretary may apply an alternative methodology for conducting comparability studies in order to establish rents that are not materially different from rents charged for comparable unassisted units. If the Secretary or appropriate State agency does not complete and submit to the project owner a comparability study not later than 60 days before the anniversary date of the assistance contract under this section, the automatic annual adjustment factor shall be applied. The Secretary may not reduce the contract rents in effect on or after April 15, 1987, for newly constructed, substantially rehabilitated, or moderately rehabilitated projects assisted under this section (including projects assisted under this section as in effect prior to November 30, 1983), unless the project has been refinanced in a manner that reduces the periodic payments of the owner. Any maximum monthly rent that has been reduced by the Secretary after April 14, 1987, and prior to November 7, 1988, shall be restored to the maximum monthly rent in effect on April 15, 1987. For any project which has had its maximum monthly rents reduced after April 14, 1987, the Secretary shall make assistance payments (from amounts reserved for the original contract) to the owner of such project in an amount equal to the difference between the maximum monthly rents in effect on April 15, 1987, and the reduced maximum monthly rents, multiplied by the number of months that the reduced maximum monthly rents were in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The amount of the monthly assistance payment with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the difference between the maximum monthly rent which the contract provides that the owner is to receive for the unit and the rent the family is required to pay under section 1437a(a) of this title. Reviews of family income shall be made no less frequently than annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A family receiving tenant-based rental assistance under subsection (b)(1) of this section may pay a higher percentage of income than that specified under section 1437a(a) of this title if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the family notifies the local public housing agency of its interest in a unit renting for an amount which exceeds the permissible maximum monthly rent established for the market area under paragraph (1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) such agency determines that the rent for the unit and the rental payments of the family are reasonable, after taking into account other family expenses (including child care, unreimbursed medical expenses, and other appropriate family expenses).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A public housing agency shall not approve such excess rentals for more than 10 percent of its annual allocation of incremental rental assistance under subsection (b)(1) of this section. A public housing agency that approves such excess rentals for more than 5 percent of its annual allocation shall submit a report to the Secretary not later than 30 days following the end of the fiscal year. The report shall be submitted in such form and in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary shall establish and shall describe the public housing agency's reasons for making the exceptions, including any available evidence that the exceptions were made necessary by problems with the fair market rent established for the area. The Secretary shall ensure that each report submitted in accordance with this clause is readily available for public inspection for a period of not less than 3 years, beginning not less than 30 days following the date on which the report is submitted to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall, not later than 3 months following the end of each fiscal year, submit a report to Congress that identifies the public housing agencies that have submitted reports for such fiscal year under clause (ii), summarizes and assesses such reports, and includes recommendations for such legislative or administrative actions that the Secretary deems appropriate to correct problems identified in such reports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The assistance contract shall provide that assistance payments may be made only with respect to a dwelling unit under lease for occupancy by a family determined to be a lower income family at the time it initially occupied such dwelling unit or by a family that qualifies to receive assistance under subsection (b) of this section pursuant to section 223 or 226 of the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [12 U.S.C. 4113, 4116], except that such payments may be made with respect to unoccupied units for a period not exceeding sixty days (A) in the event that a family vacates a dwelling unit before the expiration date of the lease for occupancy or (B) where a good faith effort is being made to fill an unoccupied unit, and, subject to the provisions of the following sentence, such payments may be made, in the case of a newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated project, after such sixty-day period in an amount equal to the debt service attributable to such an unoccupied dwelling unit for a period not to exceed one year, if a good faith effort is being made to fill the unit and the unit provides decent, safe, and sanitary housing. No such payment may be made after such sixty-day period if the Secretary determines that the dwelling unit is in a project which provides the owner with revenues exceeding the costs incurred by such owner with respect to such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Assistance payments may be made with respect to up to 100 per centum of the dwelling units in any structure upon the application of the owner or prospective owner. Within the category of projects containing more than fifty <!-- PDFPage:2197 -->units and designed for use primarily by nonelderly and nonhandicapped persons which are not subject to mortgages purchased under section 305&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_2_target" name="1437f_2">2</a></sup> of the National Housing Act, the Secretary may give preference to applications for assistance involving not more than 20 per centum of the dwelling units in a project. In according any such preference, the Secretary shall compare applications received during distinct time periods not exceeding sixty days in duration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary shall take such steps as may be necessary, including the making of contracts for assistance payments in amounts in excess of the amounts required at the time of the initial renting of dwelling units, the reservation of annual contributions authority for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts, or the allocation of a portion of new authorizations for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts, to assure that assistance payments are increased on a timely basis to cover increases in maximum monthly rents or decreases in family incomes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) To the extent authorized in contracts entered into by the Secretary with a public housing agency, such agency may purchase any structure containing one or more dwelling units assisted under this section for the purpose of reselling the structure to the tenant or tenants occupying units aggregating in value at least 80 per centum of the structure's total value.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with the approval of the Secretary the public housing agency administering a contract under this section with respect to existing housing units may exercise all management and maintenance responsibilities with respect to those units pursuant to a contract between such agency and the owner of such units.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of amounts; contract authorization; standards for payments; necessity of contribution contracts; performance funding system; audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In addition to the contributions authorized to be made for the purposes specified in section 1437c of this title, the Secretary may make annual contributions to public housing agencies for the operation of low-income housing projects. The contributions payable annually under this section shall not exceed the amounts which the Secretary determines are required (i) to assure the lower income character of the projects involved, (ii) to achieve and maintain adequate operating services and reserve funds, and (iii) with respect to housing projects developed under the Indian and Alaskan Native housing program assisted under this chapter, to provide funds (in addition to any other operating costs contributions approved by the Secretary under this section) as determined by the Secretary to be required to cover the administrative costs to an Indian housing authority during the development period of a project approved pursuant to section 1437c of this title and until such time as the project is occupied. The Secretary shall embody the provisions for such annual contributions in a contract guaranteeing their payment subject to the availability of funds, and such contract shall provide that no disposition of the low-income housing project, with respect to which the contract is entered into, shall occur during and for ten years after the period when contributions were made pursuant to such contract unless approved by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that a public housing agency has failed to take the actions required to submit an acceptable audit on a timely basis in accordance with chapter 75 of title 31, the Secretary may arrange for, and pay the costs of, the audit. In such circumstances, the Secretary may withhold, from assistance otherwise payable to the agency under this section, amounts sufficient to pay for the reasonable costs of conducting an acceptable audit, including, when appropriate, the reasonable costs of accounting services necessary to place the agency's books and records in auditable condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Annual contributions under this section to any public housing agency for any project with a sufficient number of residents who are frail elderly or persons with disabilities may be used, with respect to such project, for (I) the cost of a management staff member to coordinate the provision of any services within the project provided through any agency of the Federal Government or any other public or private department, agency, or organization to residents of the project who are frail elderly or persons with disabilities to enable such residents to live independently and prevent placement in nursing homes or institutions; and (II) expenses for the provision of services for such residents of the project to enable such residents to live independently and prevent placement in nursing homes or institutions, which may include meal services, housekeeping and chore assistance, personal care, laundry assistance, transportation services, and health-related services, except that not more than 15 percent of the cost of the provision of such services may be provided under this section. For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;frail elderly&rdquo; shall have the meaning given the term under section 1701q(d) of title 12, except that such term does not include any person receiving assistance provided under the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 [42 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.] or section 8011 of this title, and the term &ldquo;persons with disabilities&rdquo; shall have the meaning given the term under section 8013 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Annual contributions under this section to any public housing agency for any project may be used, with respect to such project, for (I) the <!-- PDFPage:2224 -->cost of employing or otherwise retaining the services of one or more service coordinators under section 661&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437g_1_target" name="1437g_1">1</a></sup> of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13631] to coordinate the provision of any supportive services within the project for residents of the project who are elderly families and disabled families, and (II) expenses for the provision of such services for such residents of the project. Not more than 15 percent of the cost of the provision of such services may be provided under this section. Services may not be provided under this clause for any person receiving assistance under the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 [42 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.] or section 8011 of this title. The budget authority available under section 1437c(c) of this title for assistance under this section is authorized to be increased by $30,000,000 on or after October 1, 1992, and by $30,000,000 on or after October 1, 1993. Amounts made available under this clause shall be used to provide additional annual contributions to public housing agencies only for the purpose of providing service coordinators and services under this clause for public housing projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not make assistance available under this section for any low-income housing project unless such project is one developed pursuant to a contributions contract authorized by section 1437c of this title but not subject to section 1437f of this title, except that after the duration of any such contributions contract with respect to a low-income housing project, the Secretary may provide assistance under this section with respect to such project as long as the lower income nature of such project is maintained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For purposes of making payments under this section (except for payments under paragraph (1)(B)), the Secretary shall utilize a performance funding system that is substantially based on the system defined in regulations and in effect on February 5, 1988 (as modified by this paragraph), and that establishes standards for costs of operation and reasonable projections of income, taking into account the character and location of the project and the characteristics of the families served, in accordance with a formula representing the operations of a prototype well-managed project. Such performance funding system shall be established in consultation with public housing agencies and their associations, be contained in a regulation promulgated by the Secretary prior to the start of any fiscal year to which it applies, and remain in effect for the duration of such fiscal year without change. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Secretary shall revise the performance funding system by June 15, 1988, to accurately reflect the increase in insurance costs incurred by public housing agencies. Notwithstanding sections 583(a) and 585(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437g_2_target" name="1437g_2">2</a></sup> of title 5 (as added by section 3(a) of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990), any proposed regulation providing for amendment, alteration, adjustment, or other change to the performance funding system relating to vacant public housing units shall be issued pursuant to a negotiated rulemaking procedure under subchapter IV&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437g_2_target" name="1437g_2">2</a></sup> of chapter 5 of such title (as added by section 3(a) of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990), and the Secretary shall establish a negotiated rulemaking committee for development of any such proposed regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under the performance funding system established under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the first year that the reductions occur, any public housing agency shall share equally with the Secretary any cost reductions due to the differences between projected and actual utility rates attributable to actions taken by the agency which lead to such reductions, and in subsequent years, if the energy savings are cost-effective, the Secretary may continue the sharing arrangement with the public housing agency for a period not to exceed 6 years;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of any public housing agency that receives financing (from a person other than the Secretary) or enters into a performance contract to undertake energy conservation improvements in a public housing project, under which payment does not exceed the cost of the energy saved as a result of the improvements during a negotiated contract period of not more than 12 years that is approved by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the public housing agency shall retain 100 percent of any cost avoidance due to differences between projected and actual utility consumption (adjusted for heating degree days) attributable to the improvements, until the term of the financing agreement is completed, at which time the annual utility expense level 3-year rolling base procedures shall be applied using&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(a) in the first year following the end of the contract period, the energy use during the 2 years prior to installation of the energy conservation improvements and the last contract year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(b) in the second year following the end of the contract period, the energy use during the 1 year prior to installation of the energy conservation improvements and the 2 years following the end of the contract period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(c) in the third year following the end of the contract period, the energy use in the 3 years following the end of the contract period; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the Secretary shall provide an additional operating subsidy above the current allowable utility expense level equivalent to the cost of the energy saved as a result of the improvements and sufficient to cover payments for the improvements through the term of the contract or agreement;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) there shall be a formal review process for the purpose of providing such revisions (either increases or reductions) to the allowable expense level of a public housing agency as necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) to correct inequities and abnormalities that exist in the base year expense level of such public housing agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) to accurately reflect changes in operating circumstances since the initial determination of such base year expense level; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2225 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) to ensure that the allowable expense limit accurately reflects the higher cost of operating the project in an economically distressed unit of local government and the lower cost of operating the project in an economically prosperous unit of local government;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) if a public housing agency redesigns or substantially rehabilitates a public housing project so that 2 or more dwelling units are combined to create a single larger dwelling unit, the payments received under this section shall not be reduced solely because of the resulting reduction in the number of dwelling units if not less than the same number of individuals will reside in the new larger dwelling unit as resided in the dwelling units that were combined to form such larger dwelling unit; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) if a public housing agency renovates, converts, or combines one or more dwelling units in a public housing project to create congregate space to accommodate the provision of supportive services in accordance with section 1437t of this title and section 8011 of this title, the payments received under this section shall not be reduced because of the resulting reduction in the number of dwelling units.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Adjustments to a public housing agency's operating subsidy made by the Secretary under this section shall reflect actual changes in rental income collections resulting from the application of section 3544 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on amount of aggregate rentals paid by families residing in dwelling units receiving annual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The aggregate rentals required to be paid in any year by families residing in the dwelling units administered by a public housing agency receiving annual contributions under this section shall not be less than an amount equal to one-fifth of the sum of the incomes of all such families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated for purposes of providing annual contributions under this section $2,282,436,000 for fiscal year 1993 and $2,378,298,312 for fiscal year 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There are also authorized to be appropriated to provide annual contributions under this section, in addition to amounts under paragraph (1), such sums as may be necessary for each of fiscal years 1993 and 1994, to provide each public housing agency with the difference between (A) the amount provided to the agency from amounts appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1), and (B) all funds for which the agency is eligible under the performance funding system without adjustments for estimated or unrealized savings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In addition to amounts under paragraphs (1) and (2), there are authorized to be appropriated for annual contributions under this section to provide for the costs of the adjustments to income and adjusted income under the amendments made by sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437g_3_target" name="1437g_3">3</a></sup> 573(b) and (c) of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act such sums as may be necessary for fiscal years 1993 and 1994.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Distribution of remaining appropriated funds to housing projects incurring excessive costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, in any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1979, any funds which have been appropriated for such year remain after applying the provisions of the second and fourth sentences of subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall distribute such funds to low-income housing projects which incurred excessive costs which were beyond their control and the full extent of which was not taken into account in the original distribution of funds for such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Time of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any public housing agency that submits its budget for any fiscal year of such agency to the Secretary in a timely manner in accordance with the regulations issued by the Secretary under this section, assistance to be provided to such agency under this section for such fiscal year shall commence not later than the 1st month of such fiscal year, and shall be paid in accordance with such payment schedule as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and such agency.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) In determining how many units an agency owns or operates and the relative modernization needs of agencies, the Secretary shall, except as otherwise agreed by the Secretary and the agency, count each existing unit under the annual contributions contract, except that an existing unit under the turnkey III and the mutual help programs may be counted as less than one unit, to take into account the responsibility of families for the costs of certain maintenance and repair. For purposes of this section, an agency that qualifies to receive a formula grant under paragraph (4) may elect to continue to qualify to receive a formula grant if it owns or operates at least 200 public housing units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Where an existing unit under a contract is demolished or disposed of, the Secretary shall not adjust the amount the agency receives under the formula unless more than one percent of the units are affected on a cumulative basis. Where more than one percent of the units are demolished or disposed of, the Secretary shall reduce the formula amount for the agency over a 3-year period to reflect removal of the units from the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall determine whether the data under subparagraphs (B) and (C) are statistically reliable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the average of the amount that the troubled agency received for modernization activities under this section and for major reconstruction of obsolete projects for each of the preceding three fiscal years, which average shall be adjusted to take into account changes in the cost of rehabilitating property; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) 25 percent of the difference between the amount determined under clause (i) and the amount that would be allocated to the agency in such fiscal year if the agency were not designated as a troubled agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) In determining whether an agency is &ldquo;troubled with respect to the modernization program&rdquo;, the Department shall consider only the agency's ability to carry out that program effectively based upon the agency's capacity to accomplish the physical work: (a) with decent quality; (b) in a timely manner; (c) under competent contract administration; and (d) with adequate budget controls. No other criteria shall be applied in the determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any fiscal year the Secretary may, pursuant to the request of a troubled agency, increase the amount allocated to the agency under subparagraph (A) to an amount not exceeding the amount that would be allocated to the agency in such fiscal year if the agency were not a troubled agency. An increase under this subparagraph shall be based on the agency's progress toward meeting the performance indicators under section 1437d(j)(1) of this title. The Secretary shall render a decision in writing on each such request not later than 75 days after receipt of the request and any necessary supporting documentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For any fiscal year, any amounts that would have been allocated to an agency under the formula under paragraph (2) that are not allocated to the agency because the agency receives the amount provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, shall be allocated in such year pursuant to the formula to other agencies with 250 or more units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall carry out a credit system under this subparagraph to provide agencies that receive allocations under subparagraph (A) with additional assistance under this section after the agency is determined not to be a troubled agency, to compensate for amounts not received because of the troubled agency designation. The credit system shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Any agency that receives assistance pursuant to subparagraph (A) for any fiscal year shall receive credits for the difference between the amount that the agency would have been allocated in such year if it were not designated a troubled agency and the amount allocated for the agency for such year under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) An agency may not receive credits under this subparagraph for more than 3 consecutive fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) After a 3-year period during which an agency has accrued credits, the credits accrued by the agency shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) decreased by 10 percent of the total credits accumulated if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the first fiscal year after such 3-year period of accrual of credits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) decreased by an additional 20 percent of the original total accumulated credits if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the second fiscal year after such 3-year accrual period;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) After a determination by the Secretary that an agency is not a troubled agency, the Secretary shall provide the agency with amounts made available under this clause in accordance with the amount of credits accumulated by the agency (subject to the reductions under clause (iii)). Such amounts shall be provided in addition to the amounts allocated to the agency pursuant to the formula under paragraph (2). In each fiscal year, the Secretary shall reserve from amounts available for allocation under paragraph (2)(A) the amount necessary to provide assistance pursuant to such credits, except that the reserved amount may not exceed 5 percent of the total amount available for allocation under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) In making payments for accrued credits in accordance with clause (iv), the Secretary may take into account the ability of the agency to expeditiously expend amounts received for credits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any amounts (A) allocated under paragraph (4) that become available for reallocation because an agency does not qualify to receive all or a part of its formula allocation due to failure to comply with the requirements of this section (other than because of designation as a troubled agency), and (B) recaptured by the Secretary for good cause, shall (subject to approval in appropriations Acts) be reallocated by the Secretary in the next fiscal year to other housing agencies that own or operate 250 or more units, based on their relative needs. The relative needs of agencies shall be measured by the formula established pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A public housing agency may appeal the amount of its allocation determined under the formula on the basis of unique circumstances or on the basis that the objectively measurable data regarding the agency, community, and project characteristics used for determining the formula amount were not correct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Amounts allocated to a public housing agency under paragraph (3) or (4) may be used for any eligible activity in accordance with this section, notwithstanding that the allocation amount is determined by allocating half based on relative backlog needs and half based on relative accrued needs of agencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of an application proposing demolition of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project, the project or portion of the project is obsolete as to physical condition, location, or other factors, making it unusable for housing purposes, and no reasonable program of modifications is feasible to return the project or portion of the project to useful life; or in the case of an application proposing the demolition of only a portion of a project, the demolition will help to assure the useful life of the remaining portion of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an application proposing disposition of real property of a public housing agency by sale or other transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the property's retention is not in the best interests of the tenants or the public housing agency because developmental changes in the area surrounding the project adversely affect the health or safety of the tenants or the feasible operation of the project by the public housing agency, because disposition allows the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties which will be more efficiently or effectively operated as low-income housing projects and which will preserve the total amount of low-income housing stock available in the community, or because of other factors which the Secretary determines are consistent with the best interests of the tenants and public housing agency and which are not inconsistent with other provisions of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for property other than dwelling units, the property is excess to the needs of a project or the disposition is incidental to, or does not interfere with, continued operation of a project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the net proceeds of the disposition will be used for (i) the payment of development cost for the project and for the retirement of outstanding obligations issued to finance original development or modernization of the project, which, in the case of scattered-site housing of a public housing agency, shall be in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total of such costs and obligations as the number of units disposed of bears to the total number of units of the project at the time of disposition, and (ii) to the extent that any proceeds remain after the application of proceeds in accordance with clause (i), the provision of housing assistance for low-income families through such measures as modernization of low-income housing, or the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties to operate as low-income housing; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the property's retention is not in the best interest of the tenants or the public housing agency because of extraordinary changes in the area surrounding the project or other extraordinary circumstances of the project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consultation with tenants and tenant councils; opportunity to purchase; relocation assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not approve an application or furnish assistance under this section or under this chapter unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) all tenants to be displaced as a result of the demolition or disposition will be given assistance by the public housing agency and are relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, which is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their choice, including housing assisted under section 1437f of this title, and the public housing agency provides for the payment of the relocation expenses of each tenant to be displaced, ensures that the rent paid by the tenant following relocation will not exceed the amount permitted under this chapter and shall not commence demolition or disposition of any unit until the tenant of the unit is relocated.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary is authorized to make available financial assistance for applications approved under this section using available contributions authorized under section 1437c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conditions for agency action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A public housing agency shall not take any action to demolish or dispose of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project without obtaining the approval of the Secretary and satisfying the conditions specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this section shall prevent a public housing agency from consolidating occupancy within or among buildings of a public housing project, or among projects, or with other housing for the purpose of improving the living conditions of or providing more efficient services to its tenants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Set-asides for replacement housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In each of fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary may reserve from any budget authority appropriated for such year for assistance under section 1437f of this title that is available <!-- PDFPage:2244 -->for families not currently receiving such assistance not more than 10 percent of such budget authority for providing replacement housing for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Construction on original site or in same neighborhood</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, replacement housing units for public housing units demolished may be built on the original public housing site or in the same neighborhood if the number of such replacement units is significantly fewer than the number of units demolished.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applicability to disposition of public housing project in accordance with approved homeownership program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply to the disposition of a public housing project in accordance with an approved homeownership program under subchapter II&ndash;A of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of the Family Self-Sufficiency program established under this section is to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate use of public housing and assistance under the certificate and voucher programs under section 1437f of this title with public and private resources, to enable eligible families to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall carry out a program under which each public housing agency that administers assistance under subsection (b) or (<em>o</em>) of section 1437f of this title or makes available new public housing dwelling units&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may, during fiscal years 1991 and 1992, carry out a local Family Self-Sufficiency program under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) effective on October 1, 1992, the Secretary shall require each such agency to carry out a local Family Self-Sufficiency program under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each local program shall, subject to availability of supportive services, include an action plan under subsection (g) of this section and shall provide comprehensive supportive services for families electing to participate in the program. In carrying out the self-sufficiency program under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies and provide for cooperative actions and funding agreements with such agencies. Each public housing agency administering an approved local program may employ a service coordinator to administer the local program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall not require a public housing agency to carry out a local program under subsection (a) of this section if the public housing agency provides certification (as such term is defined under title I of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12701 et seq.]) to the Secretary, that the establishment and operation of the program is not feasible because of local circumstances, which may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) lack of supportive services accessible to eligible families, which shall include insufficient availability of resources for programs under the Job Training Partnerships&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437u_1_target" name="1437u_1">1</a></sup> Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] or the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program under part F of title IV of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 681 et seq.];</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In allocating assistance available for reservation under this chapter, the Secretary may not refuse to provide assistance or decrease the amount of assistance that would otherwise be provided to any public housing agency because the agency has provided a certification under this paragraph or because, pursuant to a certification, the agency has failed to carry out a self-sufficiency program.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2254 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency required to carry out a local program under this section shall make the following housing assistance available under the program in each fiscal year:</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each such public housing agency shall continue to operate a local program for the number of families determined under this paragraph subject only to the availability under appropriations Acts of sufficient amounts for assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Nonparticipation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Assistance under the certificate or voucher programs under section 1437f of this title for a family that elects not to participate in a local program shall not be delayed by reason of such election.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Financing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the proceeds of such encumbrance will be used only to meet housing standards in accordance with subsection (f) of this section or to make such additional capital improvements as the Secretary determines to be consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Opportunity to cure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any lender that provides financing in connection with a homeownership program under this subchapter shall give the public housing agency, resident management corporation, individual owner, or other appropriate entity a reasonable opportunity to cure a financial default before foreclosing on the property, or taking other action as a result of the default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Housing quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The application shall include a plan ensuring that the unit&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Replacement assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the tenant decides not to purchase a unit, or is not qualified to do so, the recipient shall, during the term of any operating assistance under the implementation grant, permit each otherwise qualified tenant to continue to reside in the project at rents that do not exceed levels consistent with section 1437a(a) of this title or, if an otherwise qualified tenant chooses to move (at any time during the term of such operating assistance contract), the public housing agency shall, to the extent approved in appropriations Acts, offer such tenant (A) a unit in another public housing project, or (B) section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] assistance for use in other housing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relocation assistance</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of approved plan to housing assistance application; procedure upon receipt of application by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, upon receiving an application for housing assistance under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.],<sup><a href="#1439_1_target" name="1439_1">1</a></sup> section 101 of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 [12 U.S.C. 1701s], or,<sup><a href="#1439_2_target" name="1439_2">2</a></sup> if the unit of general local government in which the proposed assistance is to be provided has an approved housing assistance plan, shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) afford such unit of general local government the opportunity, during the thirty-day period beginning on the date of such notification, to object to the approval of the application on the grounds that the application is inconsistent with its housing assistance plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Upon receiving an application for such housing assistance, the Secretary shall assure that funds made available under this section shall be utilized to the maximum extent practicable to meet the needs and goals identified in the unit of local government's housing assistance plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the unit of general local government objects to the application on the grounds that it is inconsistent with its housing assistance plan, the Secretary may not approve the application unless he determines that the application is consistent with such housing assistance plan. If the Secretary determines, that such application is consistent with the housing assistance plan, he shall notify the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government of his determination and the reasons therefor in writing. If the Secretary concurs with the objection of the unit of local government, he shall notify the applicant stating the reasons therefor in writing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary does not receive an objection by the close of the period referred to in <!-- PDFPage:2280 -->paragraph (1)(B), he may approve the application unless he finds it inconsistent with the housing assistance plan. If the Secretary determines that an application is inconsistent with a housing assistance plan, he shall notify the applicant stating the reasons therefor in writing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall make the determinations referred to in paragraphs (2) and (3) within thirty days after he receives an objection pursuant to paragraph (1)(B) or within thirty days after the close of the period referred to in paragraph (1)(B), whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) As used in this section, the term &ldquo;housing assistance plan&rdquo; means a housing assistance plan submitted and approved under section 5304 of this title or, in the case of a unit of general local government not participating under title I of this Act [42 U.S.C. 5301 et seq.], a housing plan approved by the Secretary as meeting the requirements of this section. In developing a housing assistance plan under this paragraph a unit of general local government shall consult with local public agencies involved in providing for the welfare of children to determine the housing needs of (A) families identified by the agencies as having a lack of adequate housing that is a primary factor in the imminent placement of a child in foster care or in preventing the discharge of a child from foster care and reunification with his or her family; and (B) children who, upon discharge of the child from foster care, cannot return to their family or extended family and for which adoption is not available. The unit of general local government shall include in the housing assistance plan needs and goals with respect to such families and children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Housing assistance applications subject to procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) applications for assistance involving 12 or fewer units in a single project or development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) applications for assistance with respect to housing in new community developments approved under title IV of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1968 [42 U.S.C. 3901 et seq.] or title VII of the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970 [42 U.S.C. 4501 et seq.] which the Secretary determines are necessary to meet the housing requirements under such title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) applications for assistance with respect to housing financed by loans or loan guarantees from a State or agency thereof, except that the provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall apply where the unit of general local government in which the assistance is to be provided objects in its housing assistance plan to the exemption provided by this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval of housing assistance application for areas not subject to approved plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For areas in which an approved local housing assistance plan is not applicable the Secretary shall not approve an application for housing assistance unless he determines that there is a need for such assistance, taking into consideration any applicable State housing plans, and that there is or will be available in the area public facilities and services adequate to serve the housing proposed to be assisted. The Secretary shall afford the unit of general local government in which the assistance is to be provided an opportunity, during a 30-day period following receipt of an application by him, to provide comments or information relevant to the determination required to be made by the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allocation and reservation of housing assistance funds; purposes; prohibited reallocation of unutilized funds; enumerated uses for retained funds; competition for reservation and obligation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) Except as provided by subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall allocate assistance referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section the first time it is available for reservation on the basis of a formula that is contained in a regulation prescribed by the Secretary, and that is based on the relative needs of different States, areas, and communities, as reflected in data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies, amount of substandard housing, and other objectively measurable conditions specified in the regulation. The Secretary may allocate assistance under the preceding sentence in such a manner that each State shall receive not less than one-half of one percent of the amount of funds available for each program referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section in each fiscal year. In allocating assistance under this paragraph for each program of housing assistance under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall apply the formula, to the extent practicable, in a manner so that the assistance under the program is allocated according to the particular relative needs under the preceding sentence that are characteristic of and related to the particular type of assistance provided under the program. Assistance under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 [12 U.S.C. 1701q] shall be allocated in a manner that ensures that awards of the assistance under such section are made for projects of sufficient size to accommodate facilities for supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail elderly residents. The preceding sentence shall not apply to projects acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c) of title 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Assistance under section 8(b)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f(b)(1)] shall be allocated in a manner that enables participating jurisdictions to carry out, to the maximum extent practicable, comprehensive housing affordability strategies approved in accordance with section 105 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12705]. Such jurisdictions shall submit recommendations for allocating assistance under such section 8(b)(1) to the Secretary in accordance with procedures that the Secretary determines to be appropriate to permit allocations of such assistance to be made on the basis of timely and complete information. This clause may not be construed to prevent, alter, or otherwise affect the application of the formula established pursuant to clause (i) for purposes of allocating such assistance. For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;participating jurisdiction&rdquo; means a State or unit of general local govern<!-- PDFPage:2281 -->ment designated by the Secretary to be a participating jurisdiction under title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12721 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The formula allocation requirements of subparagraph (A) shall not apply to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) assistance that is approved in appropriation Acts for use under sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1439_3_target" name="1439_3">3</a></sup> 9 or 14 [42 U.S.C. 1437g, 1437<em>l</em>], or the rental rehabilitation grant program under section 17,<sup><a href="#1439_4_target" name="1439_4">4</a></sup> of the United States Housing Act of 1937, except that the Secretary shall comply with section 102 of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Reform Act of 1989 [42 U.S.C. 3545] with respect to such assistance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) other assistance referred to in subsection (a) of this section that is approved in appropriation Acts for uses that the Secretary determines are incapable of geographic allocation, including amendments of existing contracts, renewal of assistance contracts, assistance to families that would otherwise lose assistance due to the decision of the project owner to prepay the project mortgage or not to renew the assistance contract, assistance to prevent displacement or to provide replacement housing in connection with the demolition or disposition of public and Indian housing, and assistance in support of the property disposition and loan management functions of the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any allocation of assistance under subparagraph (A) shall, as determined by the Secretary, be made to the smallest practicable area, consistent with the delivery of assistance through a meaningful competitive process designed to serve areas with greater needs.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1441. Congressional declaration of national housing policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the general welfare and security of the Nation and the health and living standards of its people require housing production and related community development sufficient to remedy the serious housing shortage, the elimination of substandard and other inadequate housing through the clearance of slums and blighted areas, and the realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family, thus contributing to the development and redevelopment of communities and to the advancement of the growth, wealth, and security of the Nation. The Congress further declares that such production is necessary to enable the housing industry to make its full contribution toward an economy of maximum employment, production, and purchasing power. The policy to be followed in attaining the national housing objective established shall be: (1) private enterprise shall be encouraged to serve as large a part of the total need as it can; (2) governmental assistance shall be utilized where feasible to enable private enterprise to serve more of the total need; (3) appropriate local public bodies shall be encouraged and assisted to undertake positive programs of encouraging and assisting the development of well-planned, integrated residential neighborhoods, the development and redevelopment of communities, and the production, at lower costs, of housing of sound standards of design, construction, livability, and size for adequate family life; (4) governmental assistance to eliminate substandard and other inadequate housing through the clearance of slums and blighted areas, to facilitate community development and redevelopment, and to provide adequate housing for urban and rural nonfarm families with incomes so low that they are not being decently housed in new or existing housing shall be extended to those localities which estimate their own needs and demonstrate that these needs are not being met through reliance solely upon private enterprise, and without such aid; and (5) governmental assistance for decent, safe, and sanitary farm dwellings and related facilities shall be extended where the farm owner demonstrates that he lacks sufficient resources to provide such housing on his own account and is unable to secure necessary credit for such housing from other sources on terms and conditions which he could reasonably be expected to fulfill. The Department of Housing and Urban Development, and any other departments or agencies of the Federal Government having powers, functions, or duties with respect to housing, shall exercise their powers, functions, and duties under this or any other law, consistently with the national housing policy declared by this Act and in such manner as will facilitate sustained progress in attaining the national housing objective hereby established, and in such manner as will encourage and assist (1) the production of housing of sound standards of design, construction, livability, and size for adequate family life; (2) the reduction of the costs of housing without sacrifice of such sound standards; (3) the use of new designs, materials, techniques, and methods in residential construction, the use of standardized dimensions and methods of assembly of home-building materials and equipment, and the increase of efficiency in residential construction and maintenance; (4) the development of well-planned, integrated, residential neighborhoods and the development and redevelopment of communities; and (5) the stabilization of the housing industry at a high annual volume of residential construction.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1441a. National housing goals</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and reaffirmation of goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the supply of the Nation's housing is not increasing rapidly enough to meet the national housing goal, established in the Housing Act of 1949 [42 U.S.C. 1441 et seq.], of the &ldquo;realization as soon as feasible of the goal of a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family&rdquo;. The Congress reaffirms this national housing goal and determines that it can be substantially achieved within the next decade by the construction or rehabilitation of twenty-six million housing units, six million of these for low and moderate income families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that policies designed to contribute to the achievement of the national housing goal have not directed sufficient attention and resources to the preservation of existing housing and neighborhoods, that the deterioration and abandonment of housing for the Nation's lower income families has accelerated over the last decade, and that this acceleration has contributed to neighborhood disintegration and has partially negated the progress toward achieving the national housing goal which has been made primarily through new housing construction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Congressional declaration of purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that if the national housing goal is to be achieved, a greater effort must be made to encourage the preservation of existing housing and neighborhoods through such measures as housing preservation, moderate rehabilitation, and improvements in housing management and maintenance, in conjunction with the provision of adequate municipal services. Such an effort should concentrate, to a greater extent than it has in the past, on housing and neighborhoods where deterioration is evident but has not yet become acute.</p>

In addition, the Secretary may agree with the borrower to make annual contributions during the said five-year period in the form of credits on the borrower's indebtedness in an amount not to exceed the annual installment of interest and 50 per centum of the principal payments accruing during any installment year up to and including the fifth installment year, subject to the conditions that the borrower's income is, in fact, insufficient to enable the borrower to make payments in accordance with the plan or schedule prescribed by the Secretary and that the borrower pursues his plan of farm reorganization and improvements or enlargement with due diligence.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prerequisites; purposes; amounts; terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make a loan, grant, or combined loan and grant to an eligible very low-income applicant in order to improve or modernize a rural dwelling, to make the dwelling safer or more sanitary, or to remove hazards. The Secretary may make a loan or grant under this subsection to the applicant to cover the cost of any or all repairs, improvements, or additions such as repairing roofs, providing sanitary waste facilities, providing a convenient and sanitary water supply, repairing or providing structural supports, or making similar repairs, additions, improvements, including all preliminary and installation costs in obtaining central water and <!-- PDFPage:2309 -->sewer service. The maximum amount of a grant, a loan, or a loan and grant shall not exceed such limitations as the Secretary determines to be appropriate. Any portion of the sums advanced to the borrower treated as a loan shall be secured and be repayable within twenty years in accordance with the principles and conditions set forth in this subchapter, except that a loan for less than $2,500 need be evidenced only by a promissory note.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage adequate family-size farms the Secretary may make loans under this section and section 1473 of this title to any applicant whose farm needs enlargement or development in order to provide income sufficient to support decent, safe, and sanitary housing and other farm buildings, and may use the funds made available under clause (b) of section 1483 of this title for such purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Weatherization program; development, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to other duties specified in this section, the Secretary shall develop and conduct a weatherization program for the purpose of making grants to finance the purchase or installation, or both, of weatherization materials in dwelling units occupied by low-income families. Such grants shall be made to low-income families who own dwelling units or, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), to owners of such units for the benefit of the low-income tenants residing therein. In making grants under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to the weatherization of dwelling units occupied by low-income elderly or handicapped persons. The Secretary shall, in carrying out this section, consult with the Director of the Community Services Administration and the Secretary of Energy for the purpose of coordinating the weatherization program under this subsection, section 2809(a)(12) of this title, and part A of the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. 6861 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any grant made under this subsection to an owner of a rental dwelling unit the Secretary shall provide that (A) the benefits of weatherization assistance in connection with such unit will accrue primarily to the low-income family residing therein, (B) the rents on such dwelling unit will not be raised because of any increase in value thereof due solely to weatherization assistance provided under this subsection, and (C) no undue or excessive enhancement will occur to the value of such unit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In carrying out this subsection, the Secretary shall (A) implement the weatherization standards described in paragraphs (2)(A) and (3) of section 413(b) of the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. 6863(b)], and (B) provide that, with respect to any dwelling unit, not more than $800 of any grant made under this section be expended on weatherization materials and related matters described in section 415(c) of the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. 6865(c)], except that the Secretary shall increase such amount to not more than $1,500 to cover labor costs in areas where the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor, determines there is an insufficient number of volunteers and training participants and public service employment workers, assisted pursuant to the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] or the Older American Community Service Employment Act [42 U.S.C. 3056 et seq.], available to work on weatherization projects under the supervision of qualified supervisors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this subsection, the terms &ldquo;elderly,&rdquo; &ldquo;handicapped person,&rdquo; &ldquo;low income,&rdquo; and &ldquo;weatherization materials&rdquo; shall have the same meanings given such terms in paragraphs (3), (5), (7), and (9), respectively, of section 412 of the Energy Conservation in Existing Buildings Act of 1976 [42 U.S.C. 6862].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">During any time that any such loan is outstanding, the Secretary is authorized under regulations to be prescribed by him to grant a moratorium upon the payment of interest and principal on such loan for so long a period as he deems necessary, upon a showing by the borrower that due to circumstances beyond his control, he is unable to continue making payments of such principal and interest when due without unduly impairing his standard of living. In cases of extreme hardship under the foregoing circumstances, the Secretary is further authorized to cancel interest due and payable on such loans during the moratorium. Should any foreclosure of such a mortgage securing such a loan upon which a moratorium has been granted occur, no deficiency judgment shall be taken against the mortgagor if he shall have faithfully tried to meet his obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Foreclosure procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In foreclosing on any mortgage held by the Secretary under this subchapter, the Secretary shall follow the foreclosure procedures of the State in which the property involved is located to the extent such procedures are more favorable to the borrower than the foreclosure procedures that would otherwise be followed by the Secretary. This subsection shall be subject to the availability of amounts approved in appropriations Acts, to the extent additional budget authority is necessary to carry out this subsection.</p>

The Secretary shall establish a procedure to provide that any amounts pooled under this paragraph from the allocation for any State in any fiscal year that are not obligated during a reasonable period in such year shall be made available for any such eligible entities under paragraph (1) in such State.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Interest rates; credits; determination of eligibility; recoupment; multi-family housing projects; assistance payments to owners; amount limitations; recordkeeping and payment requirements for owners; shared housing for elderly and handicapped; rental assistance tenant contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 1472, 1487(a) and 1485 of this title, loans to persons of low or moderate income under section 1472 or 1487(a)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1490a_1_target" name="1490a_1">1</a></sup> of this title, loans under section 1485 of this title to provide rental or cooperative housing and related facilities for persons and families of low or moderate income or elderly or handicapped persons or families and loans under section 1490f of this title to provide condominium housing for persons and families of low or moderate income, shall bear interest at a rate prescribed by the Secretary at not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury upon the request of the Secretary taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum. Any loan guaranteed under this subchapter shall bear interest at such rate as may be agreed upon by the borrower and the lender.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) From the interest rate so determined, the Secretary may provide the borrower with assistance in the form of credits so as to reduce the effective interest rate to a rate not less than 1 per centum per annum for such periods of time as the Secretary may determine for applicants described in subparagraph (A) if without such assistance such applicants could not afford the dwelling or make payments on the indebtedness of the rental or cooperative housing. In the case of assistance provided under this subparagraph with respect to a loan under section 1472 of this title, the Secretary may not reduce, cancel, or refuse to renew the assistance due to an increase in the adjusted income of the borrower if the reduction, cancellation, or nonrenewal will cause the borrower to be unable to reasonably afford the resulting payments required under the loan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For persons of low income under section 1472 or 1487(a) of this title who the Secretary determines are unable to afford a dwelling with the assistance provided under subparagraph (B) and when the Secretary determines that assisted rental housing programs (as authorized under this subchapter, the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.], and the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.]) would be unsuitable in the area in which such persons reside, the Secretary may provide additional assistance, pursuant to amounts approved in appropriation Acts and for such periods of time as the Secretary may determine, which may be in an amount not to exceed the difference between (i) the amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to pay the principal indebtedness, interest, taxes, insurance, utilities, and maintenance, and (ii) 25 per centum of the income of such applicant. The amount of such additional assistance which may be approved in appropriation Acts may not exceed an aggregate amount of $100,000,000. Such additional assistance may not be so approved with respect to any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) With respect to borrowers under section 1472 or 1487(a) of this title who have received assistance under subparagraph (B) or (C), the Secretary shall provide for the recapture of all or a portion of such assistance rendered upon the disposition or nonoccupancy of the property by the borrower. In providing for such recapture, the Secretary shall make provisions to provide incentives for the borrower to maintain the property in a marketable condition. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any such assistance whenever rendered shall constitute a debt secured by the security instruments given by the borrower to the Secretary to the extent that the Secretary may provide for recapture of such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In determining the amount recaptured under this subparagraph with respect to any loan made pursuant to section 1472(a)(3) of this title for the purchase of a dwelling located on land owned by a community land trust, the Secretary shall determine any appreciation of the dwelling based on any agreement between the borrower and the community land trust that limits the sale price or appreciation of the dwelling.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Except for Federal or State laws relating to taxation, the assistance rendered to any borrower under subparagraphs (B) and (C) shall not be considered to be income or resources for any purpose under any Federal or State laws including, but not limited to, laws relating to welfare and public assistance programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2341 --><p class="statutory-body">(F) Loans subject to the interest rates and assistance provided under this paragraph (1) may be made only when the Secretary determines the needs of the applicant for necessary housing cannot be met with financial assistance from other sources including assistance under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] and the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Interest on loans under section 1472 or 1487(a) of this title to victims of a natural disaster shall not exceed the rate which would be applicable to such loans under section 1472 of this title without regard to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall make and insure loans under this section and sections 1484, 1485, and 1487 of this title to provide rental or cooperative housing and related facilities for persons and families of low income in multifamily housing projects, and shall make, and contract to make, assistance payments to the owners of such rental, congregate, or cooperative housing in order to make available to low-income occupants of such housing rentals at rates commensurate to income and not exceeding the highest of (i) 30 per centum of monthly adjusted income, (ii) 10 per centum of monthly income, or (iii) if the person or family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's or family's housing costs. Any rent or contribution of any recipient shall not increase as a result of this section or any other provision of Federal law or regulation by more than 10 per centum during any twelve-month period, unless the increase above 10 per centum is attributable to increases in income which are unrelated to this subsection or other law or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The owner of any project assisted under this paragraph shall be required to provide at least annually a budget of operating expenses and record of tenants&rsquo; income which shall be used to determine the amount of assistance for each project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The project owner shall accumulate, safeguard, and periodically pay to the Secretary any rental charges collected in excess of basic rental charges as established by the Secretary in conformity with subparagraph (A). These funds may be credited to the appropriation and used by the Secretary for making such assistance payments through the end of the next fiscal year. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, excess funds received from tenants in projects financed under section 1485 of this title during a fiscal year shall be available during the next succeeding fiscal year, together with funds provided under subparagraph (D), to the extent approved in appropriations Acts, to make assistance payments to reduce rent overburden on behalf of tenants of any such project whose rents exceed the levels referred to in subparagraph (A). In providing assistance to relieve rent overburden, the Secretary shall provide assistance with respect to very low-income and low-income families to reduce housing rentals to the levels specified in subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary, to the extent approved in appropriation Acts, may enter into rental assistance contracts aggregating not more than $398,000,000 in carrying out subparagraph (A) with respect to the fiscal year ending on September 30, 1982.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) In order to assist elderly or handicapped persons or families who elect to live in a shared housing arrangement in which they benefit as a result of sharing the facilities of a dwelling with others in a manner that effectively and efficiently meets their housing needs and thereby reduces their cost of housing, the Secretary shall permit rental assistance to be used by such persons or families if the shared housing arrangement is in a single-family dwelling. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall prescribe minimum habitability standards to assure decent, safe, and sanitary housing for such families while taking into account the special circumstances of shared housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of loans under sections 1484 and 1485 of this title approved prior to the effective date of this paragraph with respect to which rental assistance is provided, the rent for tenants receiving such assistance shall not exceed the highest of (i) 30 per centum of monthly adjusted income, (ii) 10 per centum of monthly income, or (iii) if the person or family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's or family's housing costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a section 1485 loan approved prior to the effective date of this paragraph with respect to which interest credits are provided, the tenant's rent shall not exceed the highest of (i) 30 per centum of monthly adjusted income, (ii) 10 per centum of monthly income, or (iii) if the person or family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's or family's housing costs, or, where no rental assistance authority is available, the rent level established on a basis of a 1 per centum interest rate on debt service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) No rent for a unit financed under section 1484 or 1485 of this title shall be increased as a result of this subsection or other provision of Federal law or Federal regulation by more than 10 per centum in any twelve-month period, unless the increase above 10 per centum is attributable to increases in income which are unrelated to this subsection or other law, or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of a loan with respect to the purchase of a manufactured home with respect to which rental assistance is provided, the monthly payment for principal and interest on the manufactured home and for lot rental and utilities shall not exceed the highest of (A) 30 per centum of monthly adjusted income, (B) 10 per centum of monthly income, or (C) if the person or family is receiving payments for welfare assistance from a public agency, the portion of such payments which is specifically designated by such agency to meet the person's or family's housing costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Location in rural areas; inclusion of qualified nonrural residents who will become rural residents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Housing and related facilities provided with loans described in subsection (a) of this section <!-- PDFPage:2342 -->shall be located in rural areas; and applicants eligible for such loans under section 1472, 1487(a)(1),<sup><a href="#1490a_2_target" name="1490a_2">2</a></sup> or 1490f(a) of this title, or for occupancy of housing provided with such loans under section 1485 or 1490f(c) of this title, shall include otherwise qualified nonrural residents who will become rural residents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reimbursement of Rural Housing Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be reimbursed to the Rural Housing Insurance Fund by annual appropriations (1) the amounts by which nonprincipal payments made from the fund during each fiscal year to the holders of insured loans described in subsection (a)(1) of this section exceed interest due from the borrowers during each year, and (2) the amount of assistance payments described in subsection (a)(2) of this section. There are authorized to be appropriated to the Rural Housing Insurance Fund such sums as may be necessary to reimburse such fund for the amount of assistance payments described in subsection (a)(1)(C) of this section. The Secretary may from time to time issue notes to the Secretary of the Treasury under section 1487(h) and of this title and section 1490f of this title to obtain amounts equal to such unreimbursed payments, pending the annual reimbursement by appropriation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rental assistance contract authority; preconditions, limitations, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In utilizing the rental assistance payments authority pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary shall make such assistance available in existing projects for units occupied by low income families or persons to extend expiring contracts or to provide additional assistance when necessary to provide the full amount authorized pursuant to existing contracts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any such authority remaining after carrying out subparagraph (A) shall be used in projects receiving commitments under section 1484, 1485, or 1486 of this title after fiscal year 1983 for contracts to assist very low-income families or persons to occupy the units in such projects, except that not more than 5 percent of the units assisted may be occupied by low income families or persons who are not very low-income families or persons; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any such authority remaining after carrying out subparagraphs (A) and (B) may be used to provide further assistance to existing projects under section 1484, 1485, or 1486 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall transfer rental assistance contract authority under this section from projects where such authority is unused after initial rentup and not needed because of a lack of eligible tenants in the area to projects where such authority is needed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Increases in rent or contribution of any recipient</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any rent or contribution of any recipient shall not increase as a result of this section, any amendment thereto, or any other provision of Federal law or regulation by more than 10 per centum during any twelve-month period, unless the increase above 10 per centum is attributable to increases in income which are unrelated to this subsection or other law or regulation.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization; financial and technical assistance; selection of training sites and location of housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the application of any State or political subdivision thereof, or any public or private nonprofit organization, the Secretary is authorized, after consultation with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, and after the Secretary determines that the housing and related facilities cannot reasonably be provided in any other way, to provide financial and technical assistance for the establishment, in rural areas, of housing and related facilities for trainees and their families who are residents of a rural area and have a rural background, while such trainees are enrolled and participating in training courses designed to improve their employment capability. The selection of training sites and location of housing shall be made with due regard to the economic viability of the area, and only after consideration of a labor area survey and full coordination among all Government agencies having primary responsibility for administering related programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Quality of housing and related facilities; design and location</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Housing and related facilities assisted under this section shall be safe and sanitary, constructed in the most economical manner, and of modest design, giving due consideration to the purposes to be served and the needs of the occupants, and may, in the discretion of the Secretary, include mobile family quarters. Design and location shall be such as to facilitate, as feasible, the use of such housing and related facilities for other purposes when no longer needed for the primary purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contribution of land by applicant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The applicant shall contribute the necessary land, or funds to acquire such land, from its own resources, including land acquired by donation or from funds repayable under subsection (e) of this section or borrowed from other sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conditions precedent to grant of financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No financial assistance shall be made available under this section unless, to the extent and for the periods required by the Secretary, the applicant agrees that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such housing will be maintained at all times in a safe and sanitary condition in accordance with standards prescribed by State or local law, or, in the absence of such standards, with requirements prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) priority shall be given at all times, in granting occupancy of such housing and facilities, to the trainees and their families described in subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) rentals charged them shall not exceed amounts approved by the Secretary after considering the portion of the actual total family income which the family can afford to pay for rent while meeting its other immediate needs during occupancy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Advances; repayment; limitation on amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make advances pursuant to any contract for financial assistance under this section at such times and in such manner as may be specified in the contract. Such advances for the purchase of land shall be repayable with interest and within a period not to exceed thirty-three years and may be made upon such security, if any, as the Secretary requires. Advances for other purposes may be made repayable with or without interest or nonrepayable, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the anticipated income, and cost of operation of the housing and related facilities and the ability of each applicant to finance such facilities. Any advances shall be limited to cover the capital costs of constructing such facilities, plus interest on borrowings to cover such costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Sale of housing and related facilities to ineligible transferee or diversion to use other than primary purpose; repayment of advances; return of property to original condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Should housing and related facilities assisted pursuant to a contract under this section be sold to an ineligible transferee or diverted to a use other than its primary purpose within a period specified in the contract, all advances made under such contract shall be repaid to the Secretary, up to the amount of the sales price or the fair value of the property as determined by the Secretary, whichever is higher, with interest from the date of the sale or diversion. If no suitable alternate use of the property is available, as determined by the Secretary, after the purpose of this section can no longer be served, the property shall be returned to its original condition by the recipient of the assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Interest on advances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interest charged on advances made under this section shall be at a rate, prescribed by the Secretary, which shall be not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, less not to exceed the difference between the adjusted rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury and 1 per centum per annum, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2345 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe regulations to insure that Federal funds expended under this section are not wasted or dissipated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Related facilities&rdquo; and &ldquo;trainee&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section (1) the term &ldquo;related facilities&rdquo; shall include any necessary community rooms or buildings, infirmaries, utilities, access roads, water and sewer services, and the minimum fixed or movable equipment determined by the Secretary to be necessary to make the housing reasonably habitable by trainees and their families; and (2) the term &ldquo;trainee&rdquo; means any person receiving training under any federally assisted training program.</p>
