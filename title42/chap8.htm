<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">On and after October 28, 1991, notwithstanding any other provision of State or Federal law, regulation or other requirement, any public housing agency or Indian housing authority that purchases any line of insurance from a nonprofit insurance entity, owned and controlled by public housing agencies or Indian housing authorities, and approved by the Secretary, may purchase such insurance without regard to competitive procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">On and after October 28, 1991, the Secretary shall establish standards as set forth herein, by regulation, adopted after notice and comment rulemaking pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, which will become effective not later than one year from October 28, 1991.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">On and after October 28, 1991, in establishing standards for approval of such nonprofit insurance entities, the Secretary shall be assured that such entities have sufficient surplus capital to meet reasonably expected losses, reliable accounting systems, sound actuarial projections, and employees experienced in the insurance industry. The Secretary shall not place restrictions on the investment of funds of any such entity that is regulated by the insurance department of any State that describes the types of investments insurance companies licensed in such State may make. With regard to such entities that are not so regulated, the Secretary shall establish investment guidelines that are comparable to State law regulating the investments of insurance companies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">On and after October 28, 1991, the Secretary shall not approve additional nonprofit insurance entities until such standards have become final, nor shall the Secretary revoke the approval of any nonprofit insurance entity previously approved by the Department unless for cause and after a due process hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">On and after October 28, 1991, until the Department of Housing and Urban Development has adopted regulations specifying the nature and quality of insurance covering the potential personal injury liability exposure of public housing authorities and Indian housing authorities (and their contractors, including architectural and engineering services) as a result of testing and abatement of lead-based paint in federally subsidized public and Indian housing units, said authorities shall be permitted to purchase insurance for such risk, as an allowable expense against amounts available for capital improvements (modernization): <em>Provided</em>, That such insurance is competitively selected and that coverage provided under such policies, as certified by the authority, provides reasonable coverage for the risk of liability exposure, taking into consideration the potential liability concerns inherent in the testing and abatement of lead-based paint, and the managerial and quality assurance responsibilities associated with the conduct of such activities.</p>

Any contract for such loans and any amendment to a contract for such loans shall provide that such loans shall bear interest at a rate specified by the Secretary which shall not be less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, plus one-eighth of 1 per centum. Such loans shall be secured in such manner and shall be repaid within such period not exceeding forty years, or not exceeding forty years from the date of the bonds evidencing the loan, as the Secretary may determine. The Secretary may require loans or commitments to make loans under this section to be pledged as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency in connection with a low-income housing project.</p>

Such notes or other obligations shall be in such forms and denominations and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury. The notes or other obligations issued under this subsection shall have such maturities and bear such rate or rates of interest as shall be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury. The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to purchase any notes or other obligations of the Secretary issued hereunder and for such purpose is authorized to use as a public debt transaction the proceeds from the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31, and the purposes for which securities may be issued under such chapter are extended to include any purchases of such obligations. The Secretary of the Treasury may at any time sell any of the notes or other obligations acquired by him under this section.

Such cancellation shall not affect any other terms and conditions of such contract, which shall remain in effect as if the cancellation had not occurred. This paragraph shall not apply to any loan the repayment of which was not to be made using annual contributions, or to any loan all or part of the proceeds of which are due a public housing agency from contractors or others.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contract authorization; amounts; use as security for obligations of public housing agency; use of existing structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may make annual contributions to public housing agencies to assist in achieving and maintaining the lower income character of their projects. The Secretary shall embody the provisions for such annual contributions in a contract guaranteeing their payment. The contribution payable annually under this section shall in no case exceed a sum equal to the annual amount of principal and interest payable on obligations issued by the public housing agency to finance the development or acquisition cost of the lower income project involved. Annual contributions payable under this section shall be pledged, if the Secretary so requires, as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency to assist the development or acquisition of the project to which annual contributions relate and shall be paid over a period not to exceed 40 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make contributions (in the form of grants) to public housing agencies to cover the development cost of public housing projects. The contract under which such contributions shall be made shall specify the amount of capital contributions required for <!-- PDFPage:2736 -->each project to which the contract pertains, and that the terms and conditions of such contract shall remain in effect for a 40-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of contributions that would be established for a newly constructed project by a public housing agency designed to accommodate a number of families of a given size and kind may be established under this section for a project by such public housing agency that would provide housing for the comparable number, sizes, and kinds of families through the acquisition and rehabilitation, or use under lease, of structures that are suitable for low-income housing use and obtained in the local market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Maximum amount of contributions; regulations; criteria for rates of contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe regulations fixing the maximum contributions available under different circumstances, giving consideration to cost, location, size, rent-paying ability of prospective tenants, or other factors bearing upon the amounts and periods of assistance needed to achieve and maintain low rentals. Such regulations may provide for rates of contribution based upon development, acquisition, or operation costs, number of dwelling units, number of persons housed, interest charges, or other appropriate factors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on aggregate contractual contributions; contracts for preliminary loans; payments of annual contributions; limitations on specific authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may enter into contracts for annual contributions aggregating not more than $7,875,049,000 per annum, which amount shall be increased by $1,494,400,000 on October 1, 1980, and by $906,985,000 on October 1, 1981. The additional authority to enter into such contracts provided on or after October 1, 1980, shall be effective only in such amounts as may be approved in appropriation Acts. In addition, the aggregate amount which may be obligated over the duration of the contracts may not exceed $31,200,000,000 with respect to the additional authority provided on October 1, 1980, and $18,087,370,000 with respect to the additional authority provided on October 1, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall enter into only such new contracts for preliminary loans as are consistent with the number of dwelling units for which contracts for annual contributions may be entered into.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The full faith and credit of the United States is solemnly pledged to the payment of all annual contributions contracted for pursuant to this section, and there are hereby authorized to be appropriated in each fiscal year, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the amounts necessary to provide for such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All payments of annual contributions pursuant to this section shall be made out of any funds available for purposes of this chapter when such payments are due, except that funds obtained through the issuance of obligations pursuant to section 1437b(b) of this title (including repayments or other realizations of the principal of loans made out of such funds) shall not be available for the payment of such annual contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) During such period as the Secretary may prescribe for starting construction, the Secretary may approve the conversion of public housing development authority for use under section 1437g of this title or for use for the acquisition and rehabilitation of property to be used in public housing, if the public housing agency, after consultation with the unit of local government, certifies that such assistance would be more effectively used for such purpose, and if the total number of units assisted will not be less than 90 per centum of the units covered by the original reservation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The aggregate amount of budget authority which may be obligated for contracts for annual contributions and for grants under section 1437<em>o</em> of this title is increased by $9,912,928,000 on October 1, 1983, and by such sums as may be approved in appropriation Acts on October 1, 1984.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Scope of contracts for loans or annual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract for loans or annual contributions, or both, entered into by the Secretary with a public housing agency, may cover one or more than one low-income housing project owned by such public housing agency; in the event the contract covers two or more projects, such projects may, for any of the purposes of this chapter and of such contract (including, but not limited to, the determination of the amount of the loan, annual contributions, or payments in lieu of taxes, specified in such contract), be treated collectively as one project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Local determination of need as prerequisite for contracts for preliminary loans, and contracts for loans or annual contributions; notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In recognition that there should be local determination of the need for low-income housing to meet needs not being adequately met by private enterprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary shall not make any contract with a public housing agency for preliminary loans (all of which shall be repaid out of any moneys which become available to such agency for the development of the projects involved) for surveys and planning in respect to any low-income housing projects (i) unless the governing body of the locality involved has by resolution approved the application of the public housing agency for such preliminary loan; and (ii) unless the public housing agency has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is need for such low-income housing which is not being met by private enterprise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary shall not make any contract for loans (other than preliminary loans) or for contributions pursuant to this chapter unless the governing body of the locality involved has entered into an agreement with the public housing agency providing for the local cooperation required by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter; the Secretary shall require that each such agreement shall provide that, notwithstanding any order, judgment, or decree of any court (including any settlement order), before making any amounts that are provided pursuant to any contract for contributions under this subchapter available for use for the development of any housing or other property not previously used as public housing, the public housing agency shall (A) notify the chief executive officer (or other appropriate official) of the unit of general local government in which the public housing for <!-- PDFPage:2738 -->which such amounts are to be so used is located (or to be located) of such use, and (B) pursuant to the request of such unit of general local government, provide such information as may reasonably be requested by such unit of general local government regarding the public housing to be so assisted (except to the extent otherwise prohibited by law).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Modification by Secretary of terms of contracts, etc.; limitations; amendment or supersedure of contracts for annual contributions or loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the specific limitations or standards in this chapter governing the terms of sales, rentals, leases, loans, contracts for annual contributions, or other agreements, the Secretary may, whenever he deems it necessary or desirable in the fulfillment of the purposes of this chapter, consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of any installment of principal or interest, security, amount of annual contribution, or any other term, of any contract or agreement of any kind to which the Secretary is a party. When the Secretary finds that it would promote economy or be in the financial interest of the Federal Government or is necessary to assure or maintain the lower income character of the project or projects involved, any contract heretofore or hereafter made for annual contributions, loans, or both, may be amended or superseded by a contract entered into by mutual agreement between the public housing agency and the Secretary. Contracts may not be amended or superseded in a manner which would impair the rights of the holders of any outstanding obligations of the public housing agency involved for which annual contributions have been pledged. Any rule of law contrary to this provision shall be deemed inapplicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Pledge of annual contributions as guarantee of payment of obligations issued by public housing agency; exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authority of the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section to pledge annual contributions as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency, the Secretary is authorized to pledge annual contributions as a guarantee of payment by a public housing agency of all principal and interest on obligations issued by it to assist the development or acquisition of the project to which the annual contributions relate, except that no obligation shall be guaranteed under this subsection if the income thereon is exempt from Federal taxation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Audits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) By Secretary and Comptroller General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each contract for contributions for any assistance under this chapter to a public housing agency shall provide that the Secretary, the Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall, for the purpose of audit and examination, have access to any books, documents, papers, and records of the public housing agency that are pertinent to this chapter and to its operations with respect to financial assistance under the this&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_1_target" name="1437c_1">1</a></sup> chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withholding of amounts for audits under Single Audit Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may, in the sole discretion of the Secretary, arrange for and pay the costs of an audit required under chapter 75 of title 31. In such circumstances, the Secretary may withhold, from assistance otherwise payable to the agency under this chapter, amounts sufficient to pay for the reasonable costs of conducting an acceptable audit, including, when appropriate, the reasonable costs of accounting services necessary to place the agency's books and records in auditable condition. As agreed to by the Secretary and the Inspector General, the Inspector General may arrange for an audit under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Prohibition on use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">None of the funds made available to the Department of Housing and Urban Development to carry out this chapter, which are obligated to State or local governments, public housing agencies, housing finance agencies, or other public or quasi-public housing agencies, shall be used to indemnify contractors or subcontractors of the government or agency against costs associated with judgments of infringement of intellectual property rights.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Substantial default; conveyance of title and delivery of possession; reconveyance and redelivery; payments for outstanding obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions (including contracts which amend or supersede contracts previously made) may provide that&mdash;</p>

Any prior conveyances and reconveyances or deliveries and redeliveries of possession shall not exhaust the right to require a conveyance or delivery of possession of the project to the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (1) upon the subsequent occurrence of a substantial default.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Whenever such a contract for annual contributions includes provisions which the Secretary in such contract determines are in accordance with this subsection, and the portion of the annual contribution payable for debt service requirements pursuant to such contract has been pledged by the public housing agency as security for the payment of the principal and interest on any of its obligations, the Secretary (notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter) shall continue to make such annual contributions available for the project so long as any of such obligations remain outstanding, and may covenant in such contract that in any event such annual contributions shall in each year be at least equal to an amount which, together with such income or other funds as are actually available from the project for the purpose at the time such annual contribution is made, will suffice for the payment of all installments, falling due within the next succeeding twelve months, of principal and interest on the obligations for which the annual contributions provided for in the contract shall have been pledged as security. In no case shall such annual contributions be in excess of the maximum sum specified in the contract involved, nor for longer than the remainder of the maximum period fixed by the contract.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Performance indicators for public housing agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall develop and publish in the Federal Register indicators to assess the management performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations. The indicators shall be established by rule under section 553 of title 5. Such indicators shall enable the Secretary to evaluate the performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations in all major areas of management operations. The Secretary shall, in particular, use the following indicators for public housing agencies, to the extent practicable:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The utility consumption (with appropriate adjustments to reflect different regions and unit sizes).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The percentage of units that an agency fails to inspect to ascertain maintenance or modernization needs within such period of time as the Secretary deems appropriate (with appropriate adjustments, if any, for large and small agencies).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) The extent to which the public housing agency&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) The Secretary shall, under the rulemaking procedures under section 553 of title 5, establish procedures for designating troubled public housing agencies, which procedures shall include identification of serious and substantial failure to perform as measured by the performance indicators specified under paragraph (1) and such other factors as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate. Such procedures shall provide that an agency that fails on a widespread basis to provide acceptable basic housing conditions for its residents shall be designated as a troubled public housing agency. The Secretary may use a simplified set of indicators for public housing agencies with less than 250 public housing units. The Secretary shall also designate, by rule under section 553 of title 5, agencies that are troubled with respect to the program for assistance from the Capital Fund under section 1437g(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may also, in consultation with national organizations representing public housing agencies and public officials (as the Secretary determines appropriate), identify and commend public housing agencies that meet the performance standards established under paragraph (1) in an exemplary manner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Upon designating a public housing agency with more than 250 units as troubled pursuant to subparagraph (A) and determining that an assessment under this subparagraph will not duplicate any comparable and recent review, the Secretary shall provide for an on-site, independent assessment of the management of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency's performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), the assessment team shall also consider issues relating to the agency's resident population and physical inventory, including the extent to which (I) the agency's comprehensive plan prepared pursuant to section 1437<em>l</em>&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437d_4_target" name="1437d_4">4</a></sup> of <!-- PDFPage:2750 -->this title adequately and appropriately addresses the rehabilitation needs of the agency's inventory, (II) residents of the agency are involved in and informed of significant management decisions, and (III) any projects in the agency's inventory are severely distressed and eligible for assistance pursuant to section 1437v of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) An independent assessment under this subparagraph shall be carried out by a team of knowledgeable individuals selected by the Secretary (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;assessment team&rdquo;) with expertise in public housing and real estate management. In conducting an assessment, the assessment team shall consult with the residents and with public and private entities in the jurisdiction in which the public housing is located. The assessment team shall provide to the Secretary and the public housing agency a written report, which shall contain, at a minimum, recommendations for such management improvements as are necessary to eliminate or substantially remedy existing deficiencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall seek to enter into an agreement with each troubled public housing agency, after reviewing the report submitted pursuant to subparagraph (B) (if applicable) and consulting with the agency's assessment team. Such agreement shall set forth&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency's performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), such agreement shall also set forth a plan for enhancing resident involvement in the management of the public housing agency.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of aiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing, assistance payments may be made with respect to existing housing in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Other existing housing programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary is authorized to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies pursuant to which such agencies may enter into contracts to make assistance payments to owners of existing dwelling units in accordance with this section. In areas where no public housing agency has been organized or where the Secretary determines that a public housing agency is unable to implement the provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized to enter into such contracts and to perform the other functions assigned to a public housing agency by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies for the purpose of replacing public housing transferred in accordance with subchapter II&ndash;A of this chapter. Each contract entered into under this subsection shall be for a term of not more than 60 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contents and purposes of contracts for assistance payments; amount and scope of monthly assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An assistance contract entered into pursuant to this section shall establish the maximum monthly rent (including utilities and all maintenance and management charges) which the owner is entitled to receive for each dwelling unit with respect to which such assistance payments are to be made. The maximum monthly rent shall not exceed by more than 10 per centum the fair market rental established by the Secretary periodically but not less than annually for existing or newly constructed rental dwelling units of various sizes and types in the market area suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under this section, except that the max<!-- PDFPage:2766 -->imum monthly rent may exceed the fair market rental (A) by more than 10 but not more than 20 per centum where the Secretary determines that special circumstances warrant such higher maximum rent or that such higher rent is necessary to the implementation of a housing strategy as defined in section 12705 of this title, or (B) by such higher amount as may be requested by a tenant and approved by the public housing agency in accordance with paragraph (3)(B). In the case of newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated units, the exception in the preceding sentence shall not apply to more than 20 per centum of the total amount of authority to enter into annual contributions contracts for such units which is allocated to an area and obligated with respect to any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1980. Proposed fair market rentals for an area shall be published in the Federal Register with reasonable time for public comment, and shall become effective upon the date of publication in final form in the Federal Register. Each fair market rental in effect under this subsection shall be adjusted to be effective on October 1 of each year to reflect changes, based on the most recent available data trended so the rentals will be current for the year to which they apply, of rents for existing or newly constructed rental dwelling units, as the case may be, of various sizes and types in the market area suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, after October 12, 1977, the Secretary shall prohibit high-rise elevator projects for families with children unless there is no practical alternative. The Secretary shall establish separate fair market rentals under this paragraph for Westchester County in the State of New York. The Secretary shall also establish separate fair market rentals under this paragraph for Monroe County in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In establishing fair market rentals for the remaining portion of the market area in which Monroe County is located, the Secretary shall establish the fair market rentals as if such portion included Monroe County. If units assisted under this section are exempt from local rent control while they are so assisted or otherwise, the maximum monthly rent for such units shall be reasonable in comparison with other units in the market area that are exempt from local rent control.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The assistance contract shall provide for adjustment annually or more frequently in the maximum monthly rents for units covered by the contract to reflect changes in the fair market rentals established in the housing area for similar types and sizes of dwelling units or, if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a reasonable formula. However, where the maximum monthly rent, for a unit in a new construction, substantial rehabilitation, or moderate rehabilitation project, to be adjusted using an annual adjustment factor exceeds the fair market rental for an existing dwelling unit in the market area, the Secretary shall adjust the rent only to the extent that the owner demonstrates that the adjusted rent would not exceed the rent for an unassisted unit of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, as determined by the Secretary. The immediately foregoing sentence shall be effective only during fiscal year 1995, fiscal year 1996 prior to April 26, 1996, and fiscal years 1997 and 1998, and during fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. Except for assistance under the certificate program, for any unit occupied by the same family at the time of the last annual rental adjustment, where the assistance contract provides for the adjustment of the maximum monthly rent by applying an annual adjustment factor and where the rent for a unit is otherwise eligible for an adjustment based on the full amount of the factor, 0.01 shall be subtracted from the amount of the factor, except that the factor shall not be reduced to less than 1.0. In the case of assistance under the certificate program, 0.01 shall be subtracted from the amount of the annual adjustment factor (except that the factor shall not be reduced to less than 1.0), and the adjusted rent shall not exceed the rent for a comparable unassisted unit of similar quality, type, and age in the market area. The immediately foregoing two sentences shall be effective only during fiscal year 1995, fiscal year 1996 prior to April 26, 1996, and fiscal years 1997 and 1998, and during fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. In establishing annual adjustment factors for units in new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects, the Secretary shall take into account the fact that debt service is a fixed expense. The immediately foregoing sentence shall be effective only during fiscal year 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The contract shall further provide for the Secretary to make additional adjustments in the maximum monthly rent for units under contract to the extent he determines such adjustments are necessary to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the units which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, utility rates, or similar costs which are not adequately compensated for by the adjustment in the maximum monthly rent authorized by subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall make additional adjustments in the maximum monthly rent for units under contract (subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments) to the extent the Secretary determines such adjustments are necessary to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the units that have resulted from the expiration of a real property tax exemption. Where the Secretary determines that a project assisted under this section is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent and the project's operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have been substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity, the Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments for this purpose), on a project by project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the project rents, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs, and reserves required for the owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to the Secretary for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity. Any rent comparability standard required under this paragraph may be waived by <!-- PDFPage:2767 -->the Secretary to so implement the preceding sentence. The Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments), on a project by project basis for projects receiving project-based assistance, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents to cover the costs of evaluating and reducing lead-based paint hazards, as defined in section 4851b of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Adjustments in the maximum rents under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, as determined by the Secretary. In implementing the limitation established under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall establish regulations for conducting comparability studies for projects where the Secretary has reason to believe that the application of the formula adjustments under subparagraph (A) would result in such material differences. The Secretary shall conduct such studies upon the request of any owner of any project, or as the Secretary determines to be appropriate by establishing, to the extent practicable, a modified annual adjustment factor for such market area, as the Secretary shall designate, that is geographically smaller than the applicable housing area used for the establishment of the annual adjustment factor under subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall establish such modified annual adjustment factor on the basis of the results of a study conducted by the Secretary of the rents charged, and any change in such rents over the previous year, for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the smaller market area. Where the Secretary determines that such modified annual adjustment factor cannot be established or that such factor when applied to a particular project would result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, the Secretary may apply an alternative methodology for conducting comparability studies in order to establish rents that are not materially different from rents charged for comparable unassisted units. If the Secretary or appropriate State agency does not complete and submit to the project owner a comparability study not later than 60 days before the anniversary date of the assistance contract under this section, the automatic annual adjustment factor shall be applied. The Secretary may not reduce the contract rents in effect on or after April 15, 1987, for newly constructed, substantially rehabilitated, or moderately rehabilitated projects assisted under this section (including projects assisted under this section as in effect prior to November 30, 1983), unless the project has been refinanced in a manner that reduces the periodic payments of the owner. Any maximum monthly rent that has been reduced by the Secretary after April 14, 1987, and prior to November 7, 1988, shall be restored to the maximum monthly rent in effect on April 15, 1987. For any project which has had its maximum monthly rents reduced after April 14, 1987, the Secretary shall make assistance payments (from amounts reserved for the original contract) to the owner of such project in an amount equal to the difference between the maximum monthly rents in effect on April 15, 1987, and the reduced maximum monthly rents, multiplied by the number of months that the reduced maximum monthly rents were in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of the monthly assistance payment with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the difference between the maximum monthly rent which the contract provides that the owner is to receive for the unit and the rent the family is required to pay under section 1437a(a) of this title. Reviews of family income shall be made no less frequently than annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The assistance contract shall provide that assistance payments may be made only with respect to a dwelling unit under lease for occupancy by a family determined to be a lower income family at the time it initially occupied such dwelling unit, except that such payments may be made with respect to unoccupied units for a period not exceeding sixty days (A) in the event that a family vacates a dwelling unit before the expiration date of the lease for occupancy or (B) where a good faith effort is being made to fill an unoccupied unit, and, subject to the provisions of the following sentence, such payments may be made, in the case of a newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated project, after such sixty-day period in an amount equal to the debt service attributable to such an unoccupied dwelling unit for a period not to exceed one year, if a good faith effort is being made to fill the unit and the unit provides decent, safe, and sanitary housing. No such payment may be made after such sixty-day period if the Secretary determines that the dwelling unit is in a project which provides the owner with revenues exceeding the costs incurred by such owner with respect to such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall take such steps as may be necessary, including the making of contracts for assistance payments in amounts in excess of the amounts required at the time of the initial renting of dwelling units, the reservation of annual contributions authority for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts, or the allocation of a portion of new authorizations for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts, to assure that assistance payments are increased on a timely basis to cover increases in maximum monthly rents or decreases in family incomes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Redesignated (5).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Repealed. Pub. L. 105&ndash;276, title V, &sect;550(a)(3)(C), Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2609.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) Not less than one year before termination of any contract under which assistance payments are received under this section, other than a contract for tenant-based assistance under this section, an owner shall provide written notice to the Secretary and the tenants involved of the proposed termination. The notice shall also include a statement that, if the Congress makes funds available, the owner and the Secretary may agree to a renewal of the contract, thus avoiding termination, and that in the event of termination the Department of Housing and Urban Development will provide tenant-based rental assistance to all eligible residents, enabling them to choose the place they wish to rent, which is likely to include the <!-- PDFPage:2768 -->dwelling unit in which they currently reside. Any contract covered by this paragraph that is renewed may be renewed for a period of up to 1 year or any number or years, with payments subject to the availability of appropriations for any year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the event the owner does not provide the notice required, the owner may not evict the tenants or increase the tenants&rsquo; rent payment until such time as the owner has provided the notice and 1 year has elapsed. The Secretary may allow the owner to renew the terminating contract for a period of time sufficient to give tenants 1 year of advance notice under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any notice under this paragraph shall also comply with any additional requirements established by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;termination&rdquo; means the expiration of the assistance contract or an owner's refusal to renew the assistance contract, and such term shall include termination of the contract for business reasons.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 511. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, safe, and affordable housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as of the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 27, 1997], it is estimated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the insured multifamily housing portfolio of the Federal Housing Administration consists of 14,000 rental properties, with an aggregate unpaid principal mortgage balance of $38,000,000,000; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) approximately 10,000 of these properties contain housing units that are assisted with project-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f];</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) FHA-insured multifamily rental properties are a major Federal investment, providing affordable rental housing to an estimated 2,000,000 low- and very low-income families;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) approximately 1,600,000 of these families live in dwelling units that are assisted with project-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) a substantial number of housing units receiving project-based assistance have rents that are higher than the rents of comparable, unassisted rental units in the same housing rental market;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) many of the contracts for project-based assistance will expire during the several years following the date of enactment of this Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) it is estimated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) if no changes in the terms and conditions of the contracts for project-based assistance are made before fiscal year 2000, the cost of renewing all expiring rental assistance contracts under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for both project-based and tenant-based rental assistance will increase from approximately $3,600,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 to over $14,300,000,000 by fiscal year 2000 and some $22,400,000,000 in fiscal year 2006;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) of those renewal amounts, the cost of renewing project-based assistance will increase from $1,200,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 to almost $7,400,000,000 by fiscal year 2006; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) without changes in the manner in which project-based rental assistance is provided, renewals of expiring contracts for project-based rental assistance will require an increasingly larger portion of the discretionary budget authority of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in each subsequent fiscal year for the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) absent new budget authority for the renewal of expiring rental contracts for project-based assistance, many of the FHA-insured multifamily housing projects that are assisted with project-based assistance are likely to default on their FHA-insured mortgage payments, resulting in substantial claims to the FHA General Insurance Fund and Special Risk Insurance Fund;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) more than 15 percent of federally assisted multifamily housing projects are physically or financially distressed, including a number which suffer from mismanagement;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) due to Federal budget constraints, the downsizing of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and diminished administrative capacity, the Department lacks the ability to ensure the continued economic and physical well-being of the stock of federally insured and assisted multifamily housing projects;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) the economic, physical, and management problems facing the stock of federally insured and assisted multifamily housing projects will be best served by reforms that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) reduce the cost of Federal rental assistance, including project-based assistance, to these projects by reducing the debt service and operating costs of these projects while retaining the low-income affordability and availability of this housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) address physical and economic distress of this housing and the failure of some project managers and owners of projects to comply with management and ownership rules and requirements; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) transfer and share many of the loan and contract administration functions and responsibilities of the Secretary to and with capable State, local, and other entities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) the authority and duties of the Secretary, not including the control by the Secretary of applicable accounts in the Treasury of the United States, may be delegated to State, local or other entities at the discretion of the Secretary, to the extent the Secretary determines, and for the purpose of carrying out this Act [probably means title V of Pub. L. 105&ndash;65, see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1701 of Title 12, Banks and Banking], so that the Secretary has the discretion to be relieved of processing and approving any document or action required by these reforms.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Consistent with the purposes and requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;62, see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note set out under section 1101 of Title 31, Money and Finance], the purposes of this subtitle are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to preserve low-income rental housing affordability and availability while reducing the long-term costs of project-based assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to reform the design and operation of Federal rental housing assistance programs, administered by the Secretary, to promote greater multifamily housing project operating and cost efficiencies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to encourage owners of eligible multifamily housing projects to restructure their FHA-insured mortgages and project-based assistance contracts in a manner that is consistent with this subtitle before the year in which the contract expires;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to reduce the cost of insurance claims under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] related to mortgages insured by the Secretary and used to finance eligible multifamily housing projects;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to streamline and improve federally insured and assisted multifamily housing project oversight and administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to resolve the problems affecting financially and physically troubled federally insured and assisted multifamily housing projects through cooperation with residents, owners, State and local governments, and other interested entities and individuals;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to protect the interest of project owners and managers, because they are partners of the Federal Government in meeting the affordable housing needs of the Nation through the section 8 rental housing assistance program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to protect the interest of tenants residing in the multifamily housing projects at the time of the restructuring for the housing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) to grant additional enforcement tools to use against those who violate agreements and program requirements, in order to ensure that the public interest is safeguarded and that Federal multifamily housing programs serve their intended purposes.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Prohibition of concentration of low-income families</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Prohibition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A public housing agency may not, in complying with the requirements under paragraph (2), concentrate very low-income families (or other families with relatively low incomes) in public housing dwelling units in certain public housing projects or certain buildings within projects. The Secretary shall review the income and occupancy characteristics of the public housing projects and the buildings of such projects of such agencies to ensure compliance with the provisions of this paragraph and paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deconcentration</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A public housing agency shall submit with its annual public housing agency plan under section 1437c&ndash;1 of this title an admissions policy designed to provide for deconcentration of poverty and income-mixing by bringing higher income tenants into lower income projects and lower income tenants into higher income projects. This clause may not be construed to impose or require any specific income or racial quotas for any project or projects.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Family choice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Incentives referred to in clause (ii) may be made available by a public housing agency only in a manner that allows for the eligible family to have the sole discretion in determining whether to accept the incentive and an agency may not take any adverse action toward any eligible family for choosing not to accept an incentive and occupancy of a project described in clause (i)(II),<sup><a href="#1437n_2_target" name="1437n_2">2</a></sup> <em>Provided</em>, That the skipping of a family on a waiting list to reach another family to implement the policy under clause (i) shall not be considered an adverse action. An agency implementing an admissions policy under this subparagraph shall implement the policy in a manner that does not prevent or interfere with the use of site-based waiting lists authorized under section 1437d(s)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437n_3_target" name="1437n_3">3</a></sup> of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitations on credit number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The credit number under subparagraph (B) for a public housing agency for a fiscal year may not in any case exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the number of public housing dwelling units of the agency that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) are in projects that are located in census tracts having a poverty rate of 30 percent or more; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Fungibility floor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any authority under subparagraph (A), of the public housing dwelling units of a public housing agency made available for occupancy in any fiscal year by eligible families, not less than 30 percent shall be occupied by families whose incomes at the time of commencement of occupancy do not exceed 30 percent of the area median income, as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Jurisdictions served by multiple PHAs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any 2 or more public housing agencies that administer tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title with respect solely to identical geographical areas, such agencies shall be treated as a single public housing agency for purposes of paragraph (1).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Prohibition of skipping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In developing admission procedures implementing paragraphs (1), (2), and (3), the Secretary shall prohibit project owners from selecting families for residence in an order different from the order on the waiting list for the purpose of selecting relatively higher income families for residence.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) disposition allows the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties that will be more efficiently or effectively operated as low-income housing;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to encourage increased resident management of public housing projects, as a means of improving existing living conditions in public housing projects, by providing increased flexibility for public housing projects that are managed by residents by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) permitting the retention, and use for certain purposes, of any revenues exceeding operating and project costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing funding, from amounts otherwise available, for technical assistance to promote formation and development of resident management entities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;public housing project&rdquo; includes one or more contiguous buildings or an area of contiguous row houses the elected resident councils of which approve the establishment of a resident management corporation and otherwise meet the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">As a condition of entering into a resident management program, the elected resident <!-- PDFPage:2840 -->council of a public housing project shall approve the establishment of a resident management corporation. When such approval is made by the elected resident council of a building or row house area, the resident management program shall not interfere with the rights of other families residing in the project or harm the efficient operation of the project. The resident management corporation and the resident council may be the same organization, if the organization complies with the requirements applicable to both the corporation and council. The corporation shall be a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of the State in which the project is located, and the tenants of the project shall be the sole voting members of the corporation. If there is no elected resident council, a majority of the households of the public housing project shall approve the establishment of a resident council to determine the feasibility of establishing a resident management corporation to manage the project.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Public housing management specialist</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The resident council of a public housing project, in cooperation with the public housing agency, shall select a qualified public housing management specialist to assist in determining the feasibility of, and to help establish, a resident management corporation and to provide training and other duties agreed to in the daily operations of the project.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Management responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A resident management corporation that qualifies under this section, and that supplies insurance and bonding or equivalent protection sufficient to the Secretary and the public housing agency, shall enter into a contract with the public housing agency establishing the respective management rights and responsibilities of the corporation and the public housing agency. Such contract shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter applicable to public housing projects and may include specific terms governing management personnel and compensation, access to public housing project records, submission of and adherence to budgets, rent collection procedures, tenant income verification, tenant eligibility determinations, tenant eviction, the acquisition of supplies and materials, rent determination, community service requirements,,<sup><a href="#1437r_1_target" name="1437r_1">1</a></sup> and such other matters as may be appropriate.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of Federal requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Waiver of regulatory requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of any resident management corporation and public housing agency, and after notice and an opportunity to comment is afforded to the affected tenants, the Secretary may waive (for both the resident management corporation and the public housing agency) any requirement established by the Secretary (and not specified in any statute) that the Secretary determines to unnecessarily increase the costs or restrict the income of a public housing project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the total income of a public housing agency (including any amounts from the Capital or Operating Funds provided to the public housing agency under section 1437g of this title) is reduced or increased, the income provided by the public housing agency to a public housing project managed by a resident management corporation shall be reduced or increased in proportion to the reduction or increase in the total income of the public housing agency, except that any reduction in amounts from the Operating Fund that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the public housing agency shall not affect the funds provided to the resident management corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Retention of excess revenues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Any income generated by a resident management corporation of a public housing project that exceeds the income estimated for purposes of this subsection shall be excluded in subsequent years in calculating (i) the allocations from the Operating Fund for the public housing agency under section 1437g of this title; and (ii) the funds provided by the public housing agency to the resident management corporation.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A public housing agency may convert any public housing project (or portion thereof) owned by the public housing agency to tenant-based assistance, but only in accordance with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conversion assessment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To convert public housing under this section, a public housing agency shall conduct an assessment of the public housing that includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a cost analysis that demonstrates whether or not the cost (both on a net present value basis and in terms of new budget authority requirements) of providing tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title for the same families in substantially similar dwellings over the same period of time is less expensive than continuing public housing assistance in the public housing project for the remaining useful life of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an analysis of the market value of the public housing project both before and after rehabilitation, and before and after conversion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an analysis of the rental market conditions with respect to the likely success of the use of tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title in that market for the specific residents of the public housing project, including an assessment of the availability of decent and safe dwellings renting at or below the payment standard established for tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title by the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the impact of the conversion to tenant-based assistance under this section on the <!-- PDFPage:2846 -->neighborhood in which the public housing project is located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) a plan that identifies actions, if any, that the public housing agency would take with regard to converting any public housing project or projects (or portions thereof) of the public housing agency to tenant-based assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 2 years after the effective date under section 503(a) of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, each public housing agency shall conduct an assessment under paragraph (1) or (3) of the status of each public housing project owned by such agency and shall submit to the Secretary such assessment. A public housing agency may otherwise undertake an assessment under this subsection at any time and for any public housing project (or portion thereof) owned by the agency. A public housing agency may update a previously conducted assessment for a project (or portion thereof) for purposes of compliance with the one-year limitation under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Streamlined assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the discretion of the Secretary or at the request of a public housing agency, the Secretary may waive any or all of the requirements of paragraph (1) or (3) or otherwise require a streamlined assessment with respect to any public housing project or class of public housing projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Criteria for implementation of conversion plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A public housing agency may convert a public housing project (or portion thereof) owned by the agency to tenant-based assistance only pursuant to a conversion assessment under subsection (b) of this section that one year&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437t_1_target" name="1437t_1">1</a></sup> and that demonstrates that the conversion&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will not be more expensive than continuing to operate the public housing project (or portion thereof) as public housing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will principally benefit the residents of the public housing project (or portion thereof) to be converted, the public housing agency, and the community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will not adversely affect the availability of affordable housing in such community.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conversion plan requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A public housing project may be converted under this section to tenant-based assistance only as provided in a conversion plan under this subsection, which has not been disapproved by the Secretary pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. Each conversion plan shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be developed by the public housing agency, in consultation with the appropriate public officials, with significant participation by the residents of the project (or portion thereof) to be converted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be consistent with and part of the public housing agency plan;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1437u. Family Self-Sufficiency program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of the Family Self-Sufficiency program established under this section is to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate use of public housing and assistance under the certificate and voucher programs under section 1437f of this title with public and private resources, to enable eligible families to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall carry out a program under which each public housing agency that administers assistance under subsection (b) or (<em>o</em>) of section 1437f of this title or makes available new public housing dwelling units&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may, during fiscal years 1991 and 1992, carry out a local Family Self-Sufficiency program under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) effective on October 1, 1992, the Secretary shall require each such agency to carry out a local Family Self-Sufficiency program under this section, subject to the limitations in paragraph (4); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) effective on October 21, 1998, to the extent an agency is not required to carry out a program pursuant to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph and paragraph (4), may carry out a local Family Self-Sufficiency program under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each local program shall, subject to availability of supportive services, include an action plan under subsection (g) of this section and shall provide comprehensive supportive services for families electing to participate in the program. In carrying out the self-sufficiency program under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies and provide for cooperative actions and funding agreements with such agencies. Each public housing agency administering an approved local program may employ a service coordinator to administer the local program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall not require a public housing agency to carry out a local program under subsection (a) of this section if the public housing agency provides certification (as such term is defined under title I of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12701 et seq.]) to the Secretary, that the establishment and operation of the program is not feasible because of local circumstances, which may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) lack of supportive services accessible to eligible families, which shall include insufficient availability of resources for programs under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] or the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program under part F&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437u_1_target" name="1437u_1">1</a></sup> of title IV of the Social Security Act;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) lack of funding for reasonable administrative costs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) lack of cooperation by other units of State or local government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) any other circumstances that the Secretary may consider appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:2848 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In allocating assistance available for reservation under this chapter, the Secretary may not refuse to provide assistance or decrease the amount of assistance that would otherwise be provided to any public housing agency because the agency has provided a certification under this paragraph or because, pursuant to a certification, the agency has failed to carry out a self-sufficiency program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (4), each public housing agency required to carry out a local program under this section shall make the following housing assistance available under the program in each fiscal year:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Certificate and voucher assistance under section 1437f(b) and (<em>o</em>) of this title, in an amount equivalent to the increase for such year in the number of families so assisted by the agency (as compared to the preceding year).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Public housing dwelling units, in the number equal to the increase for such year in units made available by the agency (as compared to the preceding year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each such public housing agency shall continue to operate a local program for the number of families determined under this paragraph subject only to the availability under appropriations Acts of sufficient amounts for assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination of requirement to expand program</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a public housing agency that receives incremental assistance under subsection (b) or (<em>o</em>) of section 1437f of this title or that makes available new public housing dwelling units shall not be required, after October 21, 1998, to provide assistance under a local Family Self-Sufficiency program under this section to any families not required to be assisted under subparagraph (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Continuation of existing obligations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each public housing agency that, before October 21, 1998, was required under this section to carry out a local Family Self-Sufficiency program shall continue to operate such local program for the number of families determined under paragraph (3), subject only to the availability under appropriations Acts of sufficient amounts for housing assistance.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The number of families for which an agency is required under clause (i) to operate such local program shall be decreased by one for each family that, after October 21, 1998, fulfills its obligations under the contract of participation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Nonparticipation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Assistance under the certificate or voucher programs under section 1437f of this title for a family that elects not to participate in a local program shall not be delayed by reason of such election.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contract of participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency carrying out a local program under this section shall enter into a contract with each leaseholder receiving assistance under the certificate and voucher programs of the public housing agency under section 1437f of this title or residing in public housing administered by the agency, that elects to participate in the self-sufficiency program under this section. The contract shall set forth the provisions of the local program, shall establish specific interim and final goals by which compliance with and performance of the contract may be measured, and shall specify the resources and supportive services to be made available to the participating family pursuant to paragraph (2) and the responsibilities of the participating family. The contract shall provide that the public housing agency may terminate or withhold assistance under section 1437f of this title and services under paragraph (2) of this subsection if the public housing agency determines, through an administrative grievance procedure in accordance with the requirements of section 1437d(k) of this title, that the family has failed to comply with the requirements of the contract without good cause (which may include a loss or reduction in access to supportive services, or a change in circumstances that makes the family or individual unsuitable for participation).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Supportive services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local program under this section shall provide appropriate supportive services under this paragraph to each participating family entering into a contract of participation under paragraph (1). The supportive services shall be provided during the period the family is receiving assistance under section 1437f of this title or residing in public housing, and may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) child care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) transportation necessary to receive services;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Term and extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each family participating in a local program shall be required to fulfill its obligations under the contract of participation not later than 5 years after entering into the contract. The public housing agency shall extend the term of the contract for any family that requests an extension, upon a finding of the agency of good cause.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2849 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Employment and counseling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The contract of participation shall require the head of the participating family to seek suitable employment during the term of the contract. The public housing agency may, during such period, provide counseling for the family with respect to affordable rental and homeownership opportunities in the private housing market and money management counseling.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Incentives for participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maximum rents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the term of the contract of participation, the amount of rent paid by any participating family whose monthly adjusted income does not exceed 50 percent of the area median income for occupancy in the public housing unit or dwelling unit assisted under section 1437f of this title may not be increased on the basis of any increase in the earned income of the family, unless the increase results in an income exceeding 50 percent of the area median income. The Secretary shall provide for increased rents for participating families whose incomes are between 50 and 80 percent of the area median income, so that any family whose income increases to 80 percent or more of the area median income pays 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income for rent. Upon completion of the contract of participation, if the participating family continues to qualify for and reside in a dwelling unit in public housing or housing assisted under section 1437f of this title, the rent charged the participating family shall be increased (if applicable) to 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the family.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Escrow savings accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each participating family whose monthly adjusted income is less than 50 percent of the area median income, the difference between 30 percent of the adjusted income of the participating family and the amount of rent paid by a participating family shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account established by the public housing agency on behalf of the participating family. For families with incomes between 50 and 80 percent of the area median income, the Secretary shall provide for escrow of the difference between 30 percent of the family income and the amount paid by the family for rent as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall not escrow any amounts for any family whose adjusted income exceeds 80 percent of the area median income. Amounts in the escrow account may be withdrawn by the participating family after the family ceases to receive income assistance under Federal or State welfare programs, upon successful performance of the obligations of the family under the contract of participation entered into by the family under subsection (c) of this section, as determined according to the specific goals and terms included in the contract, and under other circumstances in which the Secretary determines an exception for good cause is warranted. A public housing agency establishing such escrow accounts may make certain amounts in the accounts available to the participating families before full performance of the contract obligations based on compliance with, and completion of, specific interim goals included in the contract; except that any such amounts shall be used by the participating families for purposes consistent with the contracts of participation, as determined by the public housing agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency carrying out a local program under this section shall establish a plan to offer incentives to families to encourage families to participate in the program. The plan shall require the establishment of escrow savings accounts under paragraph (2) and may include any other incentives designed by the public housing agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of increases in family income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any increase in the earned income of a family during the participation of the family in a local program established under this section may not be considered as income or a resource for purposes of eligibility of the family for other benefits, or amount of benefits payable to the family, under any program administered by the Secretary, unless the income of the family equals or exceeds 80 percent of the median income of the area (as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Program coordinating committee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Functions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency carrying out a local program under this section shall, in consultation with the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government, develop an action plan under subsection (g) of this section, carry out activities under the local program, and secure commitments of public and private resources through a program coordinating committee established by the public housing agency under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Membership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The program coordinating committee may consist of representatives of the public housing agency, the unit of general local government, the local agencies (if any) responsible for carrying out programs under title I of the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 [29 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] or the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program under part F&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437u_2_target" name="1437u_2">2</a></sup> of title IV of the Social Security Act, and other organizations, such as other State and local welfare and employment agencies, public and private education or training institutions, nonprofit service providers, and private businesses.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Development of plan</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1437z&ndash;7. Mixed-finance public housing</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A public housing agency may own, operate, assist, or otherwise participate in 1 or more mixed-finance projects in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A public housing agency may provide to a mixed-finance project assistance from the Operating Fund under section 1437g of this title, assistance from the Capital Fund under such section, or both forms of assistance. A public housing agency may, in accordance with regulations established by the Secretary, provide capital assistance to a mixed-finance project in the form of a grant, loan, guarantee, or other form of investment in the project, which may involve drawdown of funds on a schedule commensurate with construction draws for deposit into an interest-bearing escrow account to serve as collateral or credit enhancement for bonds issued by a public agency, or for other forms of public or private borrowings, for the construction or rehabilitation of the development.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent deemed appropriate by the Secretary, assistance used in connection with the costs associated with the operation and management of mixed-finance projects may be used for funding of an operating reserve to ensure affordability for low-income and very low-income families in lieu of the availability of operating funds for public housing units in a mixed-finance project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compliance with public housing requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The units assisted with capital or operating assistance in a mixed-finance project shall be developed, operated, and maintained in accordance with the requirements of this chapter relating to public housing during the period required by under&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437z-7_1_target" name="1437z-7_1">1</a></sup> this chapter, unless otherwise specified in this section. For purposes of this chapter, any reference to public housing owned or operated by a public housing agency shall include dwelling units in a mixed finance project that are assisted by the agency with capital or operating assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Mixed-finance projects</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;mixed-finance project&rdquo; means a project that meets the requirements of paragraph (2) and is financially assisted by private resources, which may include low-income housing tax credits, in addition to amounts provided under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Types of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term includes a project that is developed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by a public housing agency or by an entity affiliated with a public housing agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) by a partnership, a limited liability company, or other entity in which the public housing agency (or an entity affiliated with a public housing agency) is a general partner, managing member, or otherwise participates in the activities of that entity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) by any entity that grants to the public housing agency the right of first refusal and first option to purchase, after the close of the compliance period, of the qualified low-income building in which the public housing units exist in accordance with section 42(i)(7) of title 26; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in accordance with such other terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Structure of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each mixed-finance project shall be developed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in a manner that ensures that public housing units are made available in the project, by regulatory and operating agreement, master contract, individual lease, condominium or cooperative agreement, or equity interest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in a manner that ensures that the number of public housing units bears approximately the same proportion to the total number of units in the mixed-finance project as the value of the total financial commitment provided by the public housing agency bears to the value of the total financial commitment in the project, or shall not be less than the number of units that could have been developed under the conventional public housing program with the assistance, or as may otherwise be approved by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in accordance with such other requirements as the Secretary may prescribe by regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Taxation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A public housing agency may elect to exempt all public housing units in a mixed-finance project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) from the provisions of section 1437d(d) of this title, and instead subject such units to local real estate taxes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) from the finding of need and cooperative agreement provisions under section 1437c(e)(1)(ii) and 1437c(e)(2) of this title, but only if the development of the units is not inconsistent with the jurisdiction's comprehensive housing affordability strategy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Low-income housing tax credit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to any unit in a mixed-finance project that is assisted pursuant to the low-income housing tax credit under section 42 of title 26, the rents charged to the residents may be set at levels not to exceed the amounts allowable under that section, provided that such levels for public housing residents do not exceed the amounts allowable under section 1437a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Use of savings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, to the extent deemed appropriate by <!-- PDFPage:2868 -->the Secretary, to facilitate the establishment of socioeconomically mixed communities, a public housing agency that uses assistance from the Capital Fund for a mixed-finance project, to the extent that income from such a project reduces the amount of assistance used for operating or other costs relating to public housing, may use such resulting savings to rent privately developed dwelling units in the neighborhood of the mixed-finance project. Such units shall be made available for occupancy only by low-income families eligible for residency in public housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Effect of certain contract terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an entity that owns or operates a mixed-finance project, that includes a significant number of units other than public housing units enters into a contract with a public housing agency, the terms of which obligate the entity to operate and maintain a specified number of units in the project as public housing units in accordance with the requirements of this chapter for the period required by law, such contractual terms may provide that, if, as a result of a reduction in appropriations under section 1437g of this title or any other change in applicable law, the public housing agency is unable to fulfill its contractual obligations with respect to those public housing units, that entity may deviate, under procedures and requirements developed through regulations by the Secretary, from otherwise applicable restrictions under this chapter regarding rents, income eligibility, and other areas of public housing management with respect to a portion or all of those public housing units, to the extent necessary to preserve the viability of those units while maintaining the low-income character of the units to the maximum extent practicable.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Financing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The application shall identify and describe the proposed financing for (A) any rehabilitation, and (B) acquisition (i) of the project, where applicable, by an entity other than the public housing agency for transfer to eligible families, and (ii) by eligible families of ownership interests in, or shares representing, units in the project.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the proceeds of such encumbrance will be used only to meet housing standards in accordance with subsection (f) of this section or to make such additional capital improvements as the Secretary determines to be consistent with the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Opportunity to cure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any lender that provides financing in connection with a homeownership program under this subchapter shall give the public housing agency, resident management corporation, individual owner, or other appropriate entity a reasonable opportunity to cure a financial default before foreclosing on the property, or taking other action as a result of the default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Housing quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The application shall include a plan ensuring that the unit&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will be free from any defects that pose a danger to health or safety before transfer of an ownership interest in, or shares representing, a unit to an eligible family; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will, not later than 2 years after the transfer to an eligible family, meet minimum housing standards established by the Secretary for the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Replacement assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the tenant decides not to purchase a unit, or is not qualified to do so, the recipient shall, during the term of any operating assistance under the implementation grant, permit each otherwise qualified tenant to continue to reside in the project at rents that do not exceed levels consistent with section 1437a(a) of this title or, if an otherwise qualified tenant chooses to move (at any time during the term of such operating assistance contract), the public housing agency shall, to the extent approved in appropriations Acts, offer such tenant (A) a unit in another public housing project, or (B) section 8 [42 U.S.C. 1437f] assistance for use in other housing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relocation assistance</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) afford such unit of general local government the opportunity, during the thirty-day period beginning on the date of such notification, to object to the approval of the application on the grounds that the application is inconsistent with its housing assistance plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Upon receiving an application for such housing assistance, the Secretary shall assure that funds made available under this section shall be utilized to the maximum extent practicable to meet the needs and goals identified in the unit of local government's housing assistance plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the unit of general local government objects to the application on the grounds that it is inconsistent with its housing assistance plan, the Secretary may not approve the application unless he determines that the application is consistent with such housing assistance plan. If the Secretary determines, that such application is consistent with the housing assistance plan, he shall notify the chief executive officer of the unit of general local government of his determination and the reasons therefor in writing. If the Secretary concurs with the objection of the unit of local government, he shall notify the applicant stating the reasons therefor in writing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary does not receive an objection by the close of the period referred to in paragraph (1)(B), he may approve the application unless he finds it inconsistent with the housing assistance plan.

In developing a housing assistance plan under this paragraph a unit of general local government shall consult with local public agencies involved in providing for the welfare of children to determine the housing needs of (A) families identified by the agencies as having a lack of adequate housing that is a primary factor in the imminent placement of a child in foster care or in preventing the discharge of a child from foster care and reunification with his or her family; and (B) children who, upon discharge of the child from foster care, cannot return to their family or extended family and for which adoption is not available. The unit of general local government shall include in the housing assistance plan needs and goals with respect to such families and children.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) Except as provided by subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall allocate assistance referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section the first time it is available for reservation on the basis of a formula that is contained in a regulation prescribed by the Secretary, and that is based on the relative needs of different States, areas, and communities, as reflected in data as to population, poverty, housing overcrowding, housing vacancies, amount of substandard housing, and other objectively measurable conditions specified in the regulation. The Secretary may allocate assistance under the preceding sentence in such a manner that each State shall receive not less than one-half of one percent of the amount of funds available for each program referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section in each fiscal year. In allocating assistance under this paragraph for each program of housing assistance under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall apply the formula, to the extent practicable, in a manner so that the assistance under the program is allocated according to the particular relative needs under the preceding sentence that are characteristic of and related to the particular type of assistance provided under the program.

The preceding sentence shall not apply to projects acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c) of title 12. Amounts for tenant-based assistance under section 8(<em>o</em>) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f(<em>o</em>)] may not be provided to any public housing agency that has been disqualified from providing such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Assistance under section 8(<em>o</em>) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f(<em>o</em>)] shall be allocated in a manner that enables participating jurisdictions to carry out, to the maximum extent practicable, comprehensive housing affordability strategies approved in accordance with section 105 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12705]. Such jurisdictions shall submit recommendations for allocating assistance under such section 8(<em>o</em>) to the Secretary in accordance with procedures that the Secretary determines to be appropriate to permit allocations of such assistance to be made on the basis of timely and complete information. This clause may not be construed to prevent, alter, or otherwise affect the application of the formula established pursuant to clause (i) for purposes of allocating such assistance. For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;participating jurisdiction&rdquo; means a State or unit of general local government designated by the Secretary to be a participating jurisdiction under title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12721 et seq.].</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any allocation of assistance under subparagraph (A) shall, as determined by the Secretary, be made to the smallest practicable area, consistent with the delivery of assistance through a meaningful competitive process designed to serve areas with greater needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Any amounts allocated to a State or areas or communities within a State that are not likely to be used within a fiscal year shall not be reallocated for use in another State, unless the Secretary determines that other areas or communities (that are eligible for assistance under the program) within the same State cannot use the amounts within that same fiscal year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2884 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may reserve such housing assistance funds as he deems appropriate for use by a State or agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with respect to fiscal years beginning after September 30, 1990, the Secretary may retain not more than 5 percent of the financial assistance that becomes available under programs described in subsection (a)(1) of this section during any fiscal year. Any such financial assistance that is retained shall be available for subsequent allocation to specific areas and communities, and may only be used for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) housing in support of desegregation efforts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any amounts retained in any fiscal year under subparagraph (A) that are unexpended at the end of such fiscal year shall remain available for the following fiscal year under the program under subsection (a)(1) of this section from which the amount was retained. Such amounts shall be allocated on the basis of the formula under subsection (d)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary shall not reserve or obligate assistance subject to allocation under paragraph (1)(A) to specific recipients, unless the assistance is first allocated on the basis of the formula contained in that paragraph and then is reserved and obligated pursuant to a competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any competition referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be conducted pursuant to specific criteria for the selection of recipients of assistance. The criteria shall be contained in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a regulation promulgated by the Secretary after notice and public comment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to the extent authorized by law, a notice published in the Federal Register.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subject to the times at which appropriations for assistance subject to paragraph (1)(A) may become available for reservation in any fiscal year, the Secretary shall take such steps as the Secretary deems appropriate to ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, the process referred to in subparagraph (A) is carried out with similar frequency and at similar times for each fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This paragraph shall not apply to assistance referred to in paragraph (4).<sup><a href="#1439_4_target" name="1439_4">4</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assistance payments for properties in Jefferson County, Texas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From budget authority made available in appropriation Acts for fiscal year 1988, the Secretary shall enter into an annual contributions contract for a term of 180 months to obligate sufficient funds to provide assistance payments pursuant to section 8(b)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f(b)(1)] on behalf of 500 lower income families from budget authority made available for fiscal year 1988, so long as such families occupy properties in Jefferson County, Texas. If a lower income family receiving assistance payments pursuant to this subsection ceases to qualify for assistance payments pursuant to the provisions of section 8 of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1437f] or of this subsection during the 180-month term of the annual contributions contract, assistance payments shall be made on behalf of another lower income family who occupies a unit identified in the previous sentence.</p>
