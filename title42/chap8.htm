<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the eligibility for financial assistance of at least one member of a family has been affirmatively established under the program of financial assistance and under this section, and the ineligibility of one or more family members has not been affirmatively established under this section, any financial assistance made available to that family by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be prorated, based on the number of individuals in the family for whom eligibility has been affirmatively established under the program of financial assistance and under this section, as compared with the total number of individuals who are members of the family.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2440 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preservation of families; students</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, following completion of the applicable hearing process, financial assistance for any individual receiving such assistance on February 5, 1988, is to be terminated, the public housing agency or other local governmental entity involved (in the case of public housing or assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f]) or the applicable Secretary (in the case of any other financial assistance) shall take one of the following actions:</p>

For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;family&rdquo; means a head of household, any spouse, any parents of the head of household, any parents of the spouse, and any children of the head of household or spouse. Financial assistance continued under this subparagraph for a family may be provided only on a prorated basis, under which the amount of financial assistance is based on the percentage of the total number of members of the family that are eligible for that assistance under the program of financial assistance and under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Defer the termination of financial assistance, if necessary to permit the orderly transition of the individual and any family members involved to other affordable housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Except as provided in clause (iii), any deferral under this subparagraph shall be for a 6-month period and may be renewed by the public housing agency or other entity involved for an aggregate period of 18-months. At the beginning of each deferral period, the public housing agency or other entity involved shall inform the individual and family members of their ineligibility for financial assistance and offer them other assistance in finding other affordable housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The time period described in clause (ii) shall not apply in the case of a refugee under section 1157 of title 8 or an individual seeking asylum under section 1158 of title 8.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) is admitted to the United States temporarily and solely for purposes of pursuing such a course of study at an established institution of learning or other recognized place of study in the United States, particularly designated by such alien and approved by the Attorney General after consultation with the Department of Education of the United States, which institution or place of study shall have agreed to report to the Attorney General the termination of attendance of each nonimmigrant student (and if any such institution of learning or place of study fails to make such reports promptly the approval shall be withdrawn); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the alien spouse and minor children of any alien described in subparagraph (A), if accompanying such alien or following to join such alien.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) There must be a declaration in writing by the individual (or, in the case of an individual who is a child, by another on the individual's behalf), under penalty of perjury, stating whether or not the individual is a citizen or national of the United States, and, if that individual is not a citizen or national of the United States, that the individual is in a satisfactory immigration status. If the declaration states that the individual is not a citizen or national of the United States and that the individual is younger than 62 years of age, the declaration shall be verified by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

<p class="statutory-body">On and after October 28, 1991, the Secretary shall establish standards as set forth herein, by regulation, adopted after notice and comment rulemaking pursuant to subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5, which will become effective not later than one year from October 28, 1991.</p>

Such loans shall be secured in such manner and shall be repaid within such period not exceeding forty years, or not exceeding forty years from the date of the bonds evidencing the loan, as the Secretary may determine.

Such notes or other obligations shall be in such forms and denominations and shall be subject to such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the Secretary with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury.

<p class="statutory-body">(5) During such period as the Secretary may prescribe for starting construction, the Secretary may approve the conversion of public housing development authority for use under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title or for use for the acquisition and rehabilitation of property to be used in public housing, if the public housing agency, after consultation with the unit of local government, certifies that such assistance would be more effectively used for such purpose, and if the total number of units assisted will not be less than 90 per centum of the units covered by the original reservation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Scope of contracts for loans or annual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract for loans or annual contributions, or both, entered into by the Secretary with a public housing agency, may cover one or more than one low-income housing project owned by such public housing agency; in the event the contract covers two or more projects, such projects may, for any of the purposes of this chapter and of such contract (including, but not limited to, the determination of the amount of the loan, annual contributions, or payments in lieu of taxes, specified in such contract), be treated collectively as one project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Local determination of need as prerequisite for contracts for preliminary loans, and contracts for loans or annual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In recognition that there should be local determination of the need for low-income housing <!-- PDFPage:2458 -->to meet needs not being adequately met by private enterprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary shall not make any contract with a public housing agency for preliminary loans (all of which shall be repaid out of any moneys which become available to such agency for the development of the projects involved) for surveys and planning in respect to any low-income housing projects (i) unless the governing body of the locality involved has by resolution approved the application of the public housing agency for such preliminary loan; and (ii) unless the public housing agency has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is need for such low-income housing which is not being met by private enterprise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary shall not make any contract for loans (other than preliminary loans) or for contributions pursuant to this chapter unless the governing body of the locality involved has entered into an agreement with the public housing agency providing for the local cooperation required by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Modification by Secretary of terms of contracts, etc.; limitations; amendment or supersedure of contracts for annual contributions or loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the specific limitations or standards in this chapter governing the terms of sales, rentals, leases, loans, contracts for annual contributions, or other agreements, the Secretary may, whenever he deems it necessary or desirable in the fulfillment of the purposes of this chapter, consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of any installment of principal or interest, security, amount of annual contribution, or any other term, of any contract or agreement of any kind to which the Secretary is a party. When the Secretary finds that it would promote economy or be in the financial interest of the Federal Government or is necessary to assure or maintain the lower income character of the project or projects involved, any contract heretofore or hereafter made for annual contributions, loans, or both, may be amended or superseded by a contract entered into by mutual agreement between the public housing agency and the Secretary. Contracts may not be amended or superseded in a manner which would impair the rights of the holders of any outstanding obligations of the public housing agency involved for which annual contributions have been pledged. Any rule of law contrary to this provision shall be deemed inapplicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Pledge of annual contributions as guarantee of payment of obligations issued by public housing agency; exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authority of the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section to pledge annual contributions as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency, the Secretary is authorized to pledge annual contributions as a guarantee of payment by a public housing agency of all principal and interest on obligations issued by it to assist the development or acquisition of the project to which the annual contributions relate, except that no obligation shall be guaranteed under this subsection if the income thereon is exempt from Federal taxation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Sale of project to lower income tenants by public housing agency; terms and conditions; commitment by Secretary to pay annual contribution unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a public housing agency may sell a low-income housing project to its lower income tenants, on such terms and conditions as the agency may determine, without affecting the Secretary's commitment to pay annual contributions with respect to that project, but such contributions shall not exceed the maximum contributions authorized under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Installation of passive or active solar energy systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In entering into contracts for assistance with respect to newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated projects under this section (other than for projects assisted pursuant to section 1437f of this title), the Secretary shall require the installation of a passive or active solar energy system in any such project where the Secretary determines that such installation would be cost effective over the estimated life of the system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Limitation on public housing development; assurance of public housing quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After September 30, 1987, in providing assistance under this chapter to a public housing agency for public housing, the Secretary shall reserve funds for the development of public housing only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary determines that additional amounts are required to complete the development of dwelling units for which amounts are obligated on or before such date;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the public housing agency certifies to the Secretary that 85 percent of the public housing dwelling units of the public housing agency&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which applications are pending that have been submitted in good faith under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title (or a comparable State or local government program) and that there is a reasonable expectation, as determined by the Secretary in writing, that the applications would be approved;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the public housing agency certifies that such development&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will replace dwelling units that are disposed of or demolished by the public housing agency, including dwelling units disposed of or lost through sale to tenants or through units redesign; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is required to comply with court orders or directions of the Secretary;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the public housing agency certifies that it has demands for family housing not sat<!-- PDFPage:2459 -->isfied by the rental assistance programs established in subsection (b) or (<em>o</em>) of section 1437f of this title for which it plans to construct or acquire projects of not more than 100 units;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) in the case of an application for development of projects (or portions of projects) designated under section 1437e(a)(1) of this title for occupancy for elderly families, only if the agency certifies to the Secretary that the use of such assistance will assist in expanding the housing available for eligible persons with disabilities identified in the allocation plan for the agency submitted under section 1437e(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the Secretary makes such reservation under paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may reserve not more than 20 percent of any amounts appropriated for development of public housing in each fiscal year for the substantial redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment of existing obsolete public housing projects or buildings and for the costs of improving the management and operation of projects undergoing redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment under this paragraph (to the extent that such improvement is necessary to maintain the physical improvements resulting from such redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;obsolete public housing project or building&rdquo; means a public housing project or building (i) having design or marketability problems resulting in vacancy in more than 25 percent of the units, or (ii)(I) for which the costs for redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment (including any costs for lead-based paint abatement activities) exceed 70 percent of the total development cost limits for new construction of similar units in the area, and (II) which has an occupancy density or a building height that is significantly in excess of that which prevails in the neighborhood in which the project is located, a bedroom configuration that could be altered to better serve the needs of families seeking occupancy to dwellings of the public housing agency, significant security problems in and around the project, or significant physical deterioration or inefficient energy and utility systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall allocate amounts reserved under this section to public housing agencies on the basis of a competition among public housing agencies applying for such amounts. The competition shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the management capability of the public housing agency to carry out the redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the expected term of the useful life of the project or building after redesign, reconstruction or redevelopment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the likelihood of achieving full occupancy within the projects or buildings of the agency that are to be assisted under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall establish limitations on the total costs of any project or building receiving amounts under this paragraph for redesign, reconstruction, and redevelopment. The cost limitations shall not be related to the total development cost system for new development or to the cost limits for modernization and shall recognize the higher direct costs of such work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Assistance may not be provided under this paragraph for any project or building assisted under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) For each fiscal year for which amounts are reserved or appropriated for the purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall establish performance goals to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of such amounts. The goals shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) be designed to maximize the effectiveness of the expenditures in a quantifiable manner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) describe the number of units to be redesigned, redeveloped, and reconstructed with such amounts and improvements in the management of projects so assisted to be accomplished with such amounts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Not later than 60 days after the end of each such fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress, which shall describe the performance goals established for the fiscal year, the activities carried out with such amounts, and a statement of whether the performance goals were met. If the performance goals were not met, the report shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) an explanation of why the goals were not met and a description of any managerial deficiencies or legal problems that contributed to not meeting such goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) plans and a schedule for achieving the level of performance under such performance goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes necessary to achieve the performance goals or improve performance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) a statement of whether the performance goals established for the fiscal year were impractical or infeasible, and, if so, the factors that contributed and resulted in establishing such impractical or infeasible goals and recommendations of actions to meet such goals, which may include changing the goals or altering or eliminating the program under this paragraph for major reconstruction of projects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary shall commit for use under clause (ii) not less than 5 percent of any amounts reserved under subparagraph (A) for each such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The amounts referred to in clause (i) shall be available to public housing agencies only for use for projects (or portions of projects) designated for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) and (e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title by disabled families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In allocating amounts reserved under this subparagraph among public housing agencies, the Secretary shall consider the need for any such amounts as identified in the allocation plans submitted by agencies under section 1437e(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary shall reserve for use under subparagraph (B) not less than 5 percent of any amounts approved in appropriation Acts for each such fiscal year for public housing grants under subsection (a)(2) of this section that are not designated <!-- PDFPage:2460 -->under such Acts for use under paragraph (2) of this subsection for the substantial redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment of existing public housing projects, buildings, or units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any amount reserved under subparagraph (A) shall be available only to public housing agencies that have designated projects (or portions of projects) for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) of this title for use only for the costs of development or acquisition of public housing projects or buildings designated for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) and (e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title by disabled families. A building so assisted may not contain more than 25 dwelling units, except that the Secretary may (in the discretion of the Secretary) waive such limitation for a building.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall carry out a competition for budget authority reserved under subparagraph (A) among eligible public housing agencies and shall allocate such budget authority to public housing agencies pursuant to the competition, based on (i) the need of the agency for such assistance (taking into consideration the allocation plans submitted under section 1437e(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title by agencies), and (ii) the extent to which the public housing projects and buildings to be developed or assisted meet the requirements of section 1437e(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Limitation on recapture of funding reservations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the reservation of public housing development funds to a public housing agency, the Secretary may not recapture any of the amounts included in such reservation due to the failure of a public housing agency to begin construction or rehabilitation, or to complete acquisition, during the 30-month period following the date of such reservation. During such 30-month period, the public housing agency shall be permitted to change the site of the public housing project or reformulate the project, if not less than the original number of dwelling units are to be constructed, rehabilitated, or acquired. There shall be excluded from the computation of such 30-month period any delay in the beginning of construction or rehabilitation of such project caused by (1) the failure of the Secretary to process such project within a reasonable period of time; (2) any environmental review requirement; (3) any legal action affecting such project; or (4) any other factor beyond the control of the public housing agency.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions; playgrounds and elevators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in any contract for loans, contributions, sale, lease, mortgage, or any other agreement or instrument made pursuant to this chapter, such covenants, conditions, or provisions as he may deem necessary in order to insure the lower income character of the project involved. Any such contract may contain a condition requiring the maintenance of an open space or playground in connection with the housing project involved if deemed necessary by the Secretary for the safety or health of children. Any such contract shall require that, except in the case of housing predominantly for elderly or disabled families, high-rise elevator projects shall not be provided for families with children unless the Secretary makes a determination that there is no practical alternative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on development costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contract for loans (other than preliminary loans) or contributions for the development, acquisition, or operation of public housing shall provide that the total development cost of the project on which the computation of any annual contributions under this chapter may be based may not exceed the amount determined under paragraph (2) (for the appropriate structure type) unless the Secretary provides otherwise, and in any case may not exceed 110 per centum of such amount unless the Secretary for good cause determines otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine the total development cost by multiplying the construction cost guideline for the project (which shall be determined by averaging the current construction costs, as listed by not less than 2 nationally recognized residential construction cost indices, for publicly bid construction of a good and sound quality) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of elevator type structures, 1.6; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Revision of maximum income limits; certification of compliance with requirements; notification of eligibility; informal hearing; compliance with procedures for sound management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may require the public housing agency to review and revise its maximum income limits if the Secretary determines that changed conditions in the locality make such revision necessary in achieving the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public housing agency shall determine, and so certify to the Secretary, that each family in the project was admitted in accordance with duly adopted regulations and approved income limits; and the public housing agency shall review the incomes of families living in the project no less frequently than annually;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the public housing agency shall promptly notify (i) any applicant determined to be ineligible for admission to the project of the basis for such determination and provide the applicant upon request, within a reasonable time after the determination is made, with an opportunity for an informal hearing on such determination, and (ii) any applicant determined to be eligible for admission to the project of the approximate date of occupancy insofar as such date can be reasonably determined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the public housing agency shall comply with such procedures and requirements as the Secretary may prescribe to assure that sound management practices will be followed in the operation of the project, including requirements pertaining to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the establishment, after public notice and an opportunity for public comment, of a written system of preferences for admission to public housing, if any, that is not inconsistent with the comprehensive housing affordability strategy under title I of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12701 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of satisfactory procedures designed to assure the prompt payment and collection of rents and the prompt processing of evictions in the case of nonpayment of rent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the establishment of effective tenant-management relationships designed to assure that satisfactory standards of tenant security and project maintenance are formulated and that the public housing agency (together with tenant councils where they exist) enforces those standards fully and effectively;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the development by local housing authority managements of viable homeownership opportunity programs for low-income families capable of assuming the responsibilities of homeownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) except in the case of agencies not receiving operating assistance under section 1437g of this title, the establishment and maintenance of a system of accounting for rental collections and costs (including administrative, utility, maintenance, repair and other operating costs) for each project or operating cost center (as determined by the Secretary), which collections and costs shall be made available to the general public and submitted to the appropriate local public official (as determined by the Secretary); except that the Secretary may permit agencies owning or operating less than 500 units <!-- PDFPage:2464 -->to comply with the requirements of this subparagraph by accounting on an agency-wide basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) requiring the public housing agency to ensure and maintain compliance with subtitle C of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13601 et seq.] and any regulations issued under such subtitle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exemption from personal and real property taxes; payments in lieu of taxes; cash contribution or tax remission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions with respect to a low-income housing project shall provide that no contributions by the Secretary shall be made available for such project unless such project (exclusive of any portion thereof which is not assisted by contributions under this chapter) is exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by the State, city, county, or other political subdivision; and such contract shall require the public housing agency to make payments in lieu of taxes equal to 10 per centum of the sum of the shelter rents charged in such project, or such lesser amount as (i) is prescribed by State law, or (ii) is agreed to by the local governing body in its agreement for local cooperation with the public housing agency required under section 1437c(e)(2) of this title, or (iii) is due to failure of a local public body or bodies other than the public housing agency to perform any obligation under such agreement. If any such project is not exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by the State, city, county, or other political subdivision, such contract shall provide, in lieu of the requirement for tax exemption and payments in lieu of taxes, that no contributions by the Secretary shall be made available for such project unless and until the State, city, county, or other political subdivision in which such project is situated shall contribute, in the form of cash or tax remission, the amount by which the taxes paid with respect to the project exceed 10 per centum of the shelter rents charged in such project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Excess funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for annual contributions shall provide that whenever in any year the receipts of a public housing agency in connection with a low-income housing project exceed its expenditures (including debt service, operation, maintenance, establishment of reserves, and other costs and charges), an amount equal to such excess shall be applied, or set aside for application, to purposes, which, in the determination of the Secretary, will effect a reduction in the amount of subsequent annual contributions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Repealed. Pub. L. 98&ndash;181, title II, &sect;214(b), Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1185</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Substantial default; conveyance of title and delivery of possession; reconveyance and redelivery; payments for outstanding obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions (including contracts which amend or supersede contracts previously made) may provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) upon the occurrence of a substantial default in respect to the covenants or conditions to which the public housing agency is subject (as such substantial default shall be defined in such contract), the public housing agency shall be obligated at the option of the Secretary either to convey title in any case where, in the determination of the Secretary (which determination shall be final and conclusive), such conveyance of title is necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter, or to deliver to the Secretary possession of the project, as then constituted, to which such contract relates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary shall be obligated to reconvey or redeliver possession of the project as constituted at the time of reconveyance or redelivery, to such public housing agency or to its successor (if such public housing agency or a successor exists) upon such terms as shall be prescribed in such contract, and as soon as practicable (i) after the Secretary is satisfied that all defaults with respect to the project have been cured, and that the project will, in order to fulfill the purposes of this chapter, thereafter be operated in accordance with the terms of such contract; or (ii) after the termination of the obligation to make annual contributions available unless there are any obligations or covenants of the public housing agency to the Secretary which are then in default. Any prior conveyances and reconveyances or deliveries and redeliveries of possession shall not exhaust the right to require a conveyance or delivery of possession of the project to the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (1) upon the subsequent occurrence of a substantial default.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Whenever such a contract for annual contributions includes provisions which the Secretary in such contract determines are in accordance with this subsection, and the portion of the annual contribution payable for debt service requirements pursuant to such contract has been pledged by the public housing agency as security for the payment of the principal and interest on any of its obligations, the Secretary (notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter) shall continue to make such annual contributions available for the project so long as any of such obligations remain outstanding, and may covenant in such contract that in any event such annual contributions shall in each year be at least equal to an amount which, together with such income or other funds as are actually available from the project for the purpose at the time such annual contribution is made, will suffice for the payment of all installments, falling due within the next succeeding twelve months, of principal and interest on the obligations for which the annual contributions provided for in the contract shall have been pledged as security. In no case shall such annual contributions be in excess of the maximum sum specified in the contract involved, nor for longer than the remainder of the maximum period fixed by the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) New construction contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On or after October 1, 1983, the Secretary may enter into a contract involving new construction only if the public housing agency demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:2465 -->that the cost of new construction in the neighborhood where the public housing agency determines the housing is needed is less than the cost of acquisition or acquisition and rehabilitation in such neighborhood, including any reserve fund under subsection (i) of this section, would be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Reserve fund; major repairs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, upon application by a public housing agency in connection with the acquisition of housing for use as public housing, establish and set aside a reserve fund in an amount not to exceed 30 per centum of the acquisition cost which shall be available for use for major repairs to such housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Performance indicators for public housing agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall develop and publish in the Federal Register indicators to assess the management performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations. The indicators shall be established by rule under section 553 of title 5. Such indicators shall enable the Secretary to evaluate the performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations in all major areas of management operations. The Secretary shall, in particular, use the following indicators for public housing agencies, to the extent practicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The number and percentage of vacancies within an agency's inventory, including the progress that an agency has made within the previous 3 years to reduce such vacancies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount and percentage of funds obligated to the public housing agency under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title which remain unexpended after 3 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The percentage of rents uncollected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The energy consumption (with appropriate adjustments to reflect different regions and unit sizes).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The average period of time that an agency requires to repair and turn-around vacant units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The proportion of maintenance work orders outstanding, including any progress that an agency has made during the preceding 3 years to reduce the period of time required to complete maintenance work orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The percentage of units that an agency fails to inspect to ascertain maintenance or modernization needs within such period of time as the Secretary deems appropriate (with appropriate adjustments, if any, for large and small agencies).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Any other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate which shall not exceed the seven factors in the statute, plus an additional five.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) The Secretary shall:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(1) administer the system of evaluating public housing agencies flexibly to ensure that such agencies are not penalized as result of circumstances beyond their control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(2) reflect in the weights assigned to the various indicators the differences in the difficulty of managing individual projects that result from their physical condition and their neighborhood environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(3) determine a public housing agency's status as &ldquo;troubled with respect to the program under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title&rdquo; based upon factors solely related to its ability to carry out that program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) The Secretary shall, under the rulemaking procedures under section 553 of title 5, establish procedures for designating troubled public housing agencies, which procedures shall include identification of serious and substantial failure to perform as measured by the performance indicators specified under paragraph (1) and such other factors as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate. The Secretary shall also designate, by rule under section 553 of title 5, agencies that are troubled with respect to the program under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may also, in consultation with national organizations representing public housing agencies and public officials (as the Secretary determines appropriate), identify and commend public housing agencies that meet the performance standards established under paragraph (1) in an exemplary manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall establish procedures for public housing agencies to appeal designation as a troubled agency (including designation as a troubled agency for purposes of the program under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title), to petition for removal of such designation, and to appeal any refusal to remove such designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Upon designating a public housing agency as troubled pursuant to subparagraph (A) and determining that an assessment under this subparagraph will not duplicate any review conducted under section 1437<em>l</em>(p) of this title, the Secretary shall provide for an on-site, independent assessment of the management of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency's performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), the assessment team shall also consider issues relating to the agency's resident population and physical inventory, including the extent to which (I) the agency's comprehensive plan prepared pursuant to section 1437<em>l</em> of this title adequately and appropriately addresses the rehabilitation needs of the agency's inventory, (II) residents of the agency are involved in and informed of significant management decisions, and (III) any projects in the agency's inventory are severely distressed and eligible for assistance pursuant to section 1437v of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) An independent assessment under this subparagraph shall be carried out by a team of knowledgeable individuals selected by the Secretary (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;assessment team&rdquo;) with expertise in public housing and real estate management. In conducting an assessment, the assessment team shall consult with the residents and with public and private entities in the jurisdiction in which the public housing is located. The assessment team shall provide to the Secretary and the public housing agency a written report, which shall contain, at a minimum, recommendations for such management improvements as are necessary to eliminate or substantially remedy existing deficiencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall seek to enter into an agreement with each troubled public housing agency, after reviewing the report submitted <!-- PDFPage:2466 -->pursuant to subparagraph (B) and consulting with the agency's assessment team. Such agreement shall set forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) targets for improving performance as measured by the performance indicators specified under paragraph (1) and other requirements within a specified period of time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) strategies for meeting such targets, including a description of the technical assistance that the Secretary will make available to the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) incentives or sanctions for effective implementation of such strategies, which may include any constraints on the use of funds that the Secretary determines are appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency's performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), such agreement shall also set forth a plan for enhancing resident involvement in the management of the public housing agency. The Secretary and the public housing agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, seek the assistance of local public and private entities in carrying out the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall apply the provisions of this paragraph to resident management corporations as well as public housing agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or of any contract for contributions, upon the occurrence of events or conditions that constitute a substantial default by a public housing agency with respect to the covenants or conditions to which the public housing agency is subject or an agreement entered into under paragraph (2), the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) solicit competitive proposals from other public housing agencies and private housing management agents (which may be selected by existing tenants through administrative procedures established by the Secretary) in the eventuality that these agents may be needed for managing all, or part, of the housing administered by a public housing agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) petition for the appointment of a receiver (which may be another public housing agency or a private management corporation) of the public housing agency to any district court of the United States or to any court of the State in which the real property of the public housing agency is situated, that is authorized to appoint a receiver for the purposes and having the powers prescribed in this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) solicit competitive proposals from other public housing agencies and private entities with experience in construction management in the eventuality that such agencies or firms may be needed to oversee implementation of assistance made available under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title for the housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) require the agency to make other arrangements acceptable to the Secretary and in the best interests of the public housing residents for managing all, or part of, such housing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Residents of a public housing agency designated as troubled pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) may petition the Secretary in writing to take 1 or more of the actions referred to in this subparagraph. The Secretary shall respond to such petitions in a timely manner with a written description of the actions, if any, the Secretary plans to take and, where applicable, the reasons why such actions differ from the course proposed by the residents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may make available to receivers and other entities selected or appointed pursuant to this paragraph such assistance as is necessary to remedy the substantial deterioration of living conditions in individual public housing developments or other related emergencies that endanger the health, safety and welfare of the residents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any proceeding under subparagraph (A)(ii), upon a determination that a substantial default has occurred, and without regard to the availability of alternative remedies, the court shall appoint a receiver to conduct the affairs of the public housing agency in a manner consistent with this chapter and in accordance with such further terms and conditions as the court may provide. The court shall have power to grant appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the petition by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The appointment of a receiver pursuant to this subsection may be terminated, upon the petition of any party, when the court determines that all defaults have been cured and the housing operated by the public housing agency will thereafter be operated in accordance with the covenants and conditions to which the public housing agency is subject.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress annually, as a part of the report of the Secretary under section 3536 of this title, a report that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">For any grievance concerning an eviction or termination of tenancy that involves any activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of other tenants or employees of the public housing agency or any drug-related criminal activity on or off such premises, the agency may (A) establish an expedited grievance procedure as the Secretary shall provide by rule under section 553 of title 5, or (B) exclude from its grievance procedure any such grievance, in any jurisdiction which requires that prior to eviction, a tenant be given a hearing in court which the Secretary determines provides the basic elements of due process (which the Secretary shall establish by rule under section 553 of title 5). Such elements of due process shall not include a requirement that the tenant be provided an opportunity to examine relevant documents within the possession of the public housing agency. The agency shall provide to the tenant a reasonable opportunity, prior to hearing or trial, to examine any relevant documents, records, or regulations directly related to the eviction or termination.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of aiding low-income families in obtaining a decent place to live and of promoting economically mixed housing, assistance payments may be made with respect to existing housing in accordance with the provisions of this section. A public housing agency may contract to make assistance payments to itself (or any agency or instrumentality thereof) as the owner of dwelling units if such agency is subject to the same program requirements as are applied to other owners. In such cases, the Secretary may establish initial rents within applicable limits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rental certificates and other existing housing programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">[(1)]&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_1_target" name="1437f_1">1</a></sup> The Secretary is authorized to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies pursuant to which such agencies may enter into contracts to make assistance payments to owners of existing dwelling units in accordance with this section. The Secretary shall enter into a separate annual contributions contract with each public housing agency to obligate the authority approved each year, beginning with the authority approved in appropriations Acts for fiscal year 1988 (other than amendment authority to increase assistance payments being made using authority approved prior to the appropriations Acts for fiscal year 1988), and such annual contributions contract (other than for annual contributions under subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section) shall bind the Secretary to make such authority, and any amendments increasing such authority, available to the public housing agency for a specified period. In areas where no public housing agency has been organized or where the Secretary determines that a public housing agency is unable to implement the provisions of this section, the Secretary is authorized to enter into such contracts and to perform the other functions assigned to a public housing agency by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_1_target" name="1437f_1">1</a></sup> The Secretary is authorized to enter into annual contributions contracts with public housing agencies for the purpose of replacing public housing transferred in accordance with subchapter II&ndash;A of this chapter. Each contract entered into under this subsection shall be for a term of not more than 60 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contents and purposes of contracts for assistance payments; amount and scope of monthly assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An assistance contract entered into pursuant to this section shall establish the maximum monthly rent (including utilities and all maintenance and management charges) which the owner is entitled to receive for each dwelling unit with respect to which such assistance payments are to be made. The maximum monthly rent shall not exceed by more than 10 per centum the fair market rental established by the Secretary periodically but not less than annually for existing or newly constructed rental dwelling units of various sizes and types in the market area suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under this section, except that the maximum monthly rent may exceed the fair market rental (A) by more than 10 but not more than 20 per centum where the Secretary determines that special circumstances warrant such higher maximum rent or that such higher rent is necessary to the implementation of a housing strategy as defined in section 12705 of this title, or (B) by such higher amount as may be requested by a tenant and approved by the public housing agency in accordance with paragraph (3)(B). In the case of newly constructed and substantially rehabilitated units, the exception in the preceding sentence shall not apply to more than 20 per centum of the total amount of authority to enter into annual contributions contracts for such units which is allocated to an area and obligated with respect to any fiscal year beginning on or after October 1, 1980. Proposed fair market rentals for an area shall be published in the Federal Register with reasonable time for public comment, and shall become effective upon the date of publication in final form in the Federal Register. Each fair market rental in effect under this subsection shall be adjusted to be effective on October 1 of each year to reflect changes, based on the most recent available data trended so the rentals will be current for the year to which they apply, of rents for existing or newly constructed rental dwelling units, as the case may be, of various sizes and types in the market area suitable for occupancy by persons assisted under this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, after October 12, 1977, the Secretary shall prohibit high-rise elevator projects for families with children unless there is no practical alternative. The Secretary shall establish separate fair market rentals under this paragraph for Westchester County in the State of New York. The Secretary shall also establish separate fair market rentals under this paragraph for Monroe County in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. In establishing fair market rentals for the remaining portion of the market area in which Monroe County is located, the Secretary shall establish the fair market rentals as if such portion included Monroe County. If units assisted under this section are exempt from local rent control while they are so assisted or otherwise, the maximum monthly rent for such units shall be reasonable in comparison with other units in the market area that are exempt from local rent control.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The assistance contract shall provide for adjustment annually or more frequently in the <!-- PDFPage:2475 -->maximum monthly rents for units covered by the contract to reflect changes in the fair market rentals established in the housing area for similar types and sizes of dwelling units or, if the Secretary determines, on the basis of a reasonable formula. However, where the maximum monthly rent, for a unit in a new construction, substantial rehabilitation, or moderate rehabilitation project, to be adjusted using an annual adjustment factor exceeds the fair market rental for an existing dwelling unit in the market area, the Secretary shall adjust the rent only to the extent that the owner demonstrates that the adjusted rent would not exceed the rent for an unassisted unit of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, as determined by the Secretary. The immediately foregoing sentence shall be effective only during fiscal year 1995, fiscal year 1996 prior to April 26, 1996, and fiscal years 1997 and 1998, and during fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. Except for assistance under the certificate program, for any unit occupied by the same family at the time of the last annual rental adjustment, where the assistance contract provides for the adjustment of the maximum monthly rent by applying an annual adjustment factor and where the rent for a unit is otherwise eligible for an adjustment based on the full amount of the factor, 0.01 shall be subtracted from the amount of the factor, except that the factor shall not be reduced to less than 1.0. In the case of assistance under the certificate program, 0.01 shall be subtracted from the amount of the annual adjustment factor (except that the factor shall not be reduced to less than 1.0), and the adjusted rent shall not exceed the rent for a comparable unassisted unit of similar quality, type, and age in the market area. The immediately foregoing two sentences shall be effective only during fiscal year 1995, fiscal year 1996 prior to April 26, 1996, and fiscal years 1997 and 1998, and during fiscal year 1999 and thereafter. In establishing annual adjustment factors for units in new construction and substantial rehabilitation projects, the Secretary shall take into account the fact that debt service is a fixed expense. The immediately foregoing sentence shall be effective only during fiscal year 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The contract shall further provide for the Secretary to make additional adjustments in the maximum monthly rent for units under contract to the extent he determines such adjustments are necessary to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the units which have resulted from substantial general increases in real property taxes, utility rates, or similar costs which are not adequately compensated for by the adjustment in the maximum monthly rent authorized by subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall make additional adjustments in the maximum monthly rent for units under contract (subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments) to the extent the Secretary determines such adjustments are necessary to reflect increases in the actual and necessary expenses of owning and maintaining the units that have resulted from the expiration of a real property tax exemption. Where the Secretary determines that a project assisted under this section is located in a community where drug-related criminal activity is generally prevalent and the project's operating, maintenance, and capital repair expenses have been substantially increased primarily as a result of the prevalence of such drug-related activity, the Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments for this purpose), on a project by project basis, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents, to a level no greater than 120 percent of the project rents, to cover the costs of maintenance, security, capital repairs, and reserves required for the owner to carry out a strategy acceptable to the Secretary for addressing the problem of drug-related criminal activity. Any rent comparability standard required under this paragraph may be waived by the Secretary to so implement the preceding sentence. The Secretary may (at the discretion of the Secretary and subject to the availability of appropriations for contract amendments), on a project by project basis for projects receiving project-based assistance, provide adjustments to the maximum monthly rents to cover the costs of evaluating and reducing lead-based paint hazards, as defined in section 4851b of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Adjustments in the maximum rents under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, as determined by the Secretary. In implementing the limitation established under the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall establish regulations for conducting comparability studies for projects where the Secretary has reason to believe that the application of the formula adjustments under subparagraph (A) would result in such material differences. The Secretary shall conduct such studies upon the request of any owner of any project, or as the Secretary determines to be appropriate by establishing, to the extent practicable, a modified annual adjustment factor for such market area, as the Secretary shall designate, that is geographically smaller than the applicable housing area used for the establishment of the annual adjustment factor under subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall establish such modified annual adjustment factor on the basis of the results of a study conducted by the Secretary of the rents charged, and any change in such rents over the previous year, for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the smaller market area. Where the Secretary determines that such modified annual adjustment factor cannot be established or that such factor when applied to a particular project would result in material differences between the rents charged for assisted units and unassisted units of similar quality, type, and age in the same market area, the Secretary may apply an alternative methodology for conducting comparability studies in order to establish rents that are not materially different from rents charged for comparable unassisted units. If the Secretary or appropriate State agency does not complete and submit to the project owner a comparability study not later than 60 days before the anniversary date of the assistance contract under this section, the automatic annual adjustment factor shall be ap<!-- PDFPage:2476 -->plied. The Secretary may not reduce the contract rents in effect on or after April 15, 1987, for newly constructed, substantially rehabilitated, or moderately rehabilitated projects assisted under this section (including projects assisted under this section as in effect prior to November 30, 1983), unless the project has been refinanced in a manner that reduces the periodic payments of the owner. Any maximum monthly rent that has been reduced by the Secretary after April 14, 1987, and prior to November 7, 1988, shall be restored to the maximum monthly rent in effect on April 15, 1987. For any project which has had its maximum monthly rents reduced after April 14, 1987, the Secretary shall make assistance payments (from amounts reserved for the original contract) to the owner of such project in an amount equal to the difference between the maximum monthly rents in effect on April 15, 1987, and the reduced maximum monthly rents, multiplied by the number of months that the reduced maximum monthly rents were in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The amount of the monthly assistance payment with respect to any dwelling unit shall be the difference between the maximum monthly rent which the contract provides that the owner is to receive for the unit and the rent the family is required to pay under section 1437a(a) of this title. Reviews of family income shall be made no less frequently than annually.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A family receiving tenant-based rental assistance under subsection (b)(1) of this section may pay a higher percentage of income than that specified under section 1437a(a) of this title if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the family notifies the local public housing agency of its interest in a unit renting for an amount which exceeds the permissible maximum monthly rent established for the market area under paragraph (1), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) such agency determines that the rent for the unit and the rental payments of the family are reasonable, after taking into account other family expenses (including child care, unreimbursed medical expenses, and other appropriate family expenses).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) A public housing agency shall not approve such excess rentals for more than 10 percent of its annual allocation of incremental rental assistance under subsection (b)(1) of this section. A public housing agency that approves such excess rentals for more than 5 percent of its annual allocation shall submit a report to the Secretary not later than 30 days following the end of the fiscal year. The report shall be submitted in such form and in accordance with such procedures as the Secretary shall establish and shall describe the public housing agency's reasons for making the exceptions, including any available evidence that the exceptions were made necessary by problems with the fair market rent established for the area. The Secretary shall ensure that each report submitted in accordance with this clause is readily available for public inspection for a period of not less than 3 years, beginning not less than 30 days following the date on which the report is submitted to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall, not later than 3 months following the end of each fiscal year, submit a report to Congress that identifies the public housing agencies that have submitted reports for such fiscal year under clause (ii), summarizes and assesses such reports, and includes recommendations for such legislative or administrative actions that the Secretary deems appropriate to correct problems identified in such reports.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The assistance contract shall provide that assistance payments may be made only with respect to a dwelling unit under lease for occupancy by a family determined to be a lower income family at the time it initially occupied such dwelling unit or by a family that qualifies to receive assistance under subsection (b) of this section pursuant to section 223 or 226 of the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 [12 U.S.C. 4113, 4116], except that such payments may be made with respect to unoccupied units for a period not exceeding sixty days (A) in the event that a family vacates a dwelling unit before the expiration date of the lease for occupancy or (B) where a good faith effort is being made to fill an unoccupied unit, and, subject to the provisions of the following sentence, such payments may be made, in the case of a newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated project, after such sixty-day period in an amount equal to the debt service attributable to such an unoccupied dwelling unit for a period not to exceed one year, if a good faith effort is being made to fill the unit and the unit provides decent, safe, and sanitary housing. No such payment may be made after such sixty-day period if the Secretary determines that the dwelling unit is in a project which provides the owner with revenues exceeding the costs incurred by such owner with respect to such project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Assistance payments may be made with respect to up to 100 per centum of the dwelling units in any structure upon the application of the owner or prospective owner. Within the category of projects containing more than fifty units and designed for use primarily by nonelderly and nonhandicapped persons which are not subject to mortgages purchased under section 305&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_2_target" name="1437f_2">2</a></sup> of the National Housing Act, the Secretary may give preference to applications for assistance involving not more than 20 per centum of the dwelling units in a project. In according any such preference, the Secretary shall compare applications received during distinct time periods not exceeding sixty days in duration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary shall take such steps as may be necessary, including the making of contracts for assistance payments in amounts in excess of the amounts required at the time of the initial renting of dwelling units, the reservation of annual contributions authority for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts, or the allocation of a portion of new authorizations for the purpose of amending housing assistance contracts, to assure that assistance payments are increased on a timely basis to cover increases in maximum monthly rents or decreases in family incomes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) To the extent authorized in contracts entered into by the Secretary with a public hous<!-- PDFPage:2477 -->ing agency, such agency may purchase any structure containing one or more dwelling units assisted under this section for the purpose of reselling the structure to the tenant or tenants occupying units aggregating in value at least 80 per centum of the structure's total value. Any such resale may be made on the terms and conditions prescribed under section 1437c(h) of this title and subject to the limitation contained in such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Each contract under this section (other than a contract for assistance under the certificate or voucher program) shall provide that the owner will notify tenants at least 90 days prior to the expiration of the contract of any rent increase which may occur as a result of the expiration of such contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) Not less than 180 days prior to terminating any contract under which assistance payments are received under this section, other than a contract under the certificate or voucher program, an owner shall provide written notice to the Secretary and the tenants involved of the proposed termination, specifying the reasons for the termination with sufficient detail to enable the Secretary to evaluate whether the termination is lawful and whether there are additional actions that can be taken by the Secretary to avoid the termination. The owner's notice shall include a statement that the owner and the Secretary may agree to a renewal of the contract, thus avoiding the termination. The Secretary shall review the owner's notice, shall consider whether there are additional actions that can be taken by the Secretary to avoid the termination, and shall ensure a proper adjustment of the contract rents for the project in conformity with the requirements of paragraph (2). The Secretary shall issue a written finding of the legality of the termination and the reasons for the termination, including the actions considered or taken to avoid the termination. Within 30 days of the Secretary's finding, the owner shall provide written notice to each tenant of the Secretary's decision. For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;termination&rdquo; means the expiration of the assistance contract or an owner's refusal to renew the assistance contract, and such term shall include termination of the contract for business reasons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) If an owner provides notice of proposed termination under paragraph (9) and the contract rent is lower than the maximum monthly rent for units assisted under subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall adjust the contract rent based on the maximum monthly rent for units assisted under subsection (b)(1) of this section and the value of the low-income housing after rehabilitation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Required provisions and duration of contracts for assistance payments; waiver of limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Contracts to make assistance payments entered into by a public housing agency with an owner of existing housing units shall provide (with respect to any unit) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the selection of tenants shall be the function of the owner, subject to the provisions of the annual contributions contract between the Secretary and the agency, except that for the certificate and moderate rehabilitation programs only, for the purpose of selecting families to be assisted, the public housing agency may establish, after public notice and an opportunity for public comment, a written system of preferences for selection that is not inconsistent with the comprehensive housing affordability strategy under title I of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12701 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the lease between the tenant and the owner shall be for at least one year or the term of such contract, whichever is shorter, and shall contain other terms and conditions specified by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) during the term of the lease, the owner shall not terminate the tenancy except for serious or repeated violation of the terms and conditions of the lease, for violation of applicable Federal, State, or local law, or for other good cause;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) during the term of the lease, any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises by other tenants, any criminal activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of their residences by persons residing in the immediate vicinity of the premises, or any drug-related criminal activity on or near such premises, engaged in by a tenant of any unit, any member of the tenant's household, or any guest or other person under the tenant's control, shall be cause for termination of tenancy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) any termination of tenancy shall be preceded by the owner's provision of written notice to the tenant specifying the grounds for such action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) it shall be cause for termination of the tenancy of a tenant if such tenant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) is fleeing to avoid prosecution, or custody or confinement after conviction, under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, for a crime, or attempt to commit a crime, which is a felony under the laws of the place from which the individual flees, or which, in the case of the State of New Jersey, is a high misdemeanor under the laws of such State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) is violating a condition of probation or parole imposed under Federal or State law;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) maintenance and replacement (including redecoration) shall be in accordance with the standard practice for the building concerned as established by the owner and agreed to by the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the agency and the owner shall carry out such other appropriate terms and conditions as may be mutually agreed to by them.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Each contract for an existing structure entered into under this section shall be for a term of not less than one month nor more than one hundred and eighty months. The Secretary shall permit public housing agencies to enter into contracts for assistance payments of less than 12 months duration in order to avoid disruption in assistance to eligible families if the annual contributions contract is within 1 year of its expiration date. Where the Secretary enters into an annual contributions contract with a <!-- PDFPage:2478 -->public housing agency pursuant to which the agency will enter into a contract for assistance payments with respect to an existing structure, the contract for assistance payments may not be attached to the structure unless (i) the Secretary and the public housing agency approve such action, and (ii) the owner agrees to rehabilitate the structure other than with assistance under this chapter and otherwise complies with the requirements of this section, except that the Secretary shall permit the public housing agency to approve such attachment with respect to not more than 15 percent of the assistance provided by the public housing agency if the requirements of clause (ii) are met. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a public housing agency and an applicable State agency may, on a priority basis, attach to structures not more than an additional 15 percent of the assistance provided by the public housing agency or the applicable State agency only with respect to projects assisted under a State program that permits the owner of the projects to prepay a State assisted or subsidized mortgage on the structure, except that attachment of assistance under this sentence shall be for the purpose of (i) providing incentives to owners to preserve such projects for occupancy by lower and moderate income families (for the period that assistance under this sentence is available), and (ii) to assist lower income tenants to afford any increases in rent that may be required to induce the owner to maintain occupancy in the project by lower and moderate income tenants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall permit any public housing agency to approve the attachment of assistance under subsection (b)(1) of this section with respect to any newly constructed structure if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the owner or prospective owner agrees to construct the structure other than with assistance under this chapter and otherwise complies with the requirements of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the aggregate assistance provided by the public housing agency pursuant to this subparagraph and the last sentence&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_3_target" name="1437f_3">3</a></sup> of subparagraph (A) does not exceed 15 percent of the assistance provided by the public housing agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a contract for assistance payments that is attached to a structure under this paragraph, a public housing agency shall enter into a contract with an owner, contingent upon the future availability of appropriations for the purpose of renewing expiring contracts for assistance payments as provided in appropriations Acts, to extend the term of the underlying contract for assistance payments for such period or periods as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to achieve long-term affordability of the housing. The contract shall obligate the owner to have such extensions of the underlying contract for assistance payments accepted by the owner and the owner's successors in interest. To the extent assistance is used as provided in the penultimate sentence&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_3_target" name="1437f_3">3</a></sup> of subparagraph (A), the contract for assistance may, at the option of the public housing agency, have an initial term not exceeding 15 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Where a contract for assistance payments is attached to a structure, the owner shall adopt written tenant selection procedures that are satisfactory to the Secretary as (i) consistent with the purpose of improving housing opportunities for very low-income families; and (ii) reasonably related to program eligibility and an applicant's ability to perform the obligations of the lease. An owner shall promptly notify in writing any rejected applicant of the grounds for any rejection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The Secretary shall annually survey public housing agencies to determine which public housing agencies have, in providing assistance in such year, reached the 15 percent limitations contained in subparagraphs (A) and (B), and shall report to the Congress on the results of such survey.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) In determining the amount of assistance provided under an assistance contract for project-based assistance under this paragraph or a contract for assistance for housing constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to assistance provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section (as such subsection existed immediately before October 1, 1983), the Secretary may consider and annually adjust, with respect to such project, for the cost of employing or otherwise retaining the services of one or more service coordinators under section 661&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437f_4_target" name="1437f_4">4</a></sup> of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13631] to coordinate the provision of any services within the project for residents of the project who are elderly or disabled families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The budget authority available under section 1437c(c) of this title for assistance under this section is authorized to be increased by $15,000,000 on or after October 1, 1992, and by $15,000,000 on or after October 1, 1993. Amounts made available under this subparagraph shall be used to provide additional amounts under annual contributions contracts for assistance under this section which shall be made available through assistance contracts only for the purpose of providing service coordinators under clause (i) for projects receiving project-based assistance under this paragraph and to provide additional amounts under contracts for assistance for projects constructed or substantially rehabilitated pursuant to assistance provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section (as such subsection existed immediately before October 1, 1983) only for such purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) An assistance contract for project-based assistance under this paragraph shall provide that the owner shall ensure and maintain compliance with subtitle C of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13601 et seq.] and any regulations issued under such subtitle.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H) An owner of a covered section 8 housing project (as such term is defined in section 659 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13619]) may give preference for occupancy of dwelling units in the project, and reserve units for occupancy, in accordance with <!-- PDFPage:2479 -->subtitle D of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13611 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, with the approval of the Secretary the public housing agency administering a contract under this section with respect to existing housing units may exercise all management and maintenance responsibilities with respect to those units pursuant to a contract between such agency and the owner of such units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A public housing agency that serves more than one unit of general local government may, at the discretion of the agency, in allocating assistance under this section, give priority to disabled families that are not elderly families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Calculation of limit</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Any contract entered into under section 514 of the Multifamily Assisted Housing Reform and Affordability Act of 1997 shall be excluded in computing the limit on project-based assistance under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Restrictions on contracts for assistance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prohibit an owner from pledging, or offering as security for any loan or obligation, a contract for assistance payments entered into pursuant to this section: <em>Provided</em>, That such security is in connection with a project constructed or rehabilitated pursuant to authority granted in this section, and the terms of the financing or any refinancing have been approved by the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;subtitle a&mdash;fha-insured multifamily housing mortgage and housing assistance restructuring</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 511. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) there exists throughout the Nation a need for decent, safe, and affordable housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) as of the date of enactment of this Act [Oct. 27, 1997], it is estimated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the insured multifamily housing portfolio of the Federal Housing Administration consists of 14,000 rental properties, with an aggregate unpaid principal mortgage balance of $38,000,000,000; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) approximately 10,000 of these properties contain housing units that are assisted with project-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f];</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) FHA-insured multifamily rental properties are a major Federal investment, providing affordable rental housing to an estimated 2,000,000 low- and very low-income families;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) approximately 1,600,000 of these families live in dwelling units that are assisted with project-based rental assistance under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) a substantial number of housing units receiving project-based assistance have rents that are higher than the rents of comparable, unassisted rental units in the same housing rental market;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) many of the contracts for project-based assistance will expire during the several years following the date of enactment of this Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) it is estimated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) if no changes in the terms and conditions of the contracts for project-based assistance are made before fiscal year 2000, the cost of renewing all expiring rental assistance contracts under section 8 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 for both project-based and tenant-based rental assistance will increase from approximately $3,600,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 to over $14,300,000,000 by fiscal year 2000 and some $22,400,000,000 in fiscal year 2006;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) of those renewal amounts, the cost of renewing project-based assistance will increase from $1,200,000,000 in fiscal year 1997 to almost $7,400,000,000 by fiscal year 2006; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) without changes in the manner in which project-based rental assistance is provided, renewals of expiring contracts for project-based rental assistance will require an increasingly larger portion of the discretionary budget authority of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in each subsequent fiscal year for the foreseeable future;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) absent new budget authority for the renewal of expiring rental contracts for project-based assistance, many of the FHA-insured multifamily housing projects that are assisted with project-based assistance are likely to default on their FHA-insured mortgage payments, resulting in substantial claims to the FHA General Insurance Fund and Special Risk Insurance Fund;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) more than 15 percent of federally assisted multifamily housing projects are physically or financially distressed, including a number which suffer from mismanagement;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) due to Federal budget constraints, the downsizing of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and diminished administrative capacity, the Department lacks the ability to ensure the continued economic and physical well-being of the stock of federally insured and assisted multifamily housing projects;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) the economic, physical, and management problems facing the stock of federally insured and assisted multifamily housing projects will be best served by reforms that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) reduce the cost of Federal rental assistance, including project-based assistance, to these projects by reducing the debt service and operating costs of these projects while retaining the low-income affordability and availability of this housing;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) address physical and economic distress of this housing and the failure of some project managers and owners of projects to comply with management and ownership rules and requirements; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) transfer and share many of the loan and contract administration functions and responsibilities <!-- PDFPage:2495 -->of the Secretary to and with capable State, local, and other entities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) the authority and duties of the Secretary, not including the control by the Secretary of applicable accounts in the Treasury of the United States, may be delegated to State, local or other entities at the discretion of the Secretary, to the extent the Secretary determines, and for the purpose of carrying out this Act [probably means title V of Pub. L. 105&ndash;65, see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1701 of Title 12, Banks and Banking], so that the Secretary has the discretion to be relieved of processing and approving any document or action required by these reforms.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Consistent with the purposes and requirements of the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;62, see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note set out under section 1101 of Title 31, Money and Finance], the purposes of this subtitle are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to preserve low-income rental housing affordability and availability while reducing the long-term costs of project-based assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to reform the design and operation of Federal rental housing assistance programs, administered by the Secretary, to promote greater multifamily housing project operating and cost efficiencies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to encourage owners of eligible multifamily housing projects to restructure their FHA-insured mortgages and project-based assistance contracts in a manner that is consistent with this subtitle before the year in which the contract expires;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to reduce the cost of insurance claims under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.] related to mortgages insured by the Secretary and used to finance eligible multifamily housing projects;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to streamline and improve federally insured and assisted multifamily housing project oversight and administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to resolve the problems affecting financially and physically troubled federally insured and assisted multifamily housing projects through cooperation with residents, owners, State and local governments, and other interested entities and individuals;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to protect the interest of project owners and managers, because they are partners of the Federal Government in meeting the affordable housing needs of the Nation through the section 8 rental housing assistance program;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to protect the interest of tenants residing in the multifamily housing projects at the time of the restructuring for the housing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) to grant additional enforcement tools to use against those who violate agreements and program requirements, in order to ensure that the public interest is safeguarded and that Federal multifamily housing programs serve their intended purposes.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of amounts; contract authorization; standards for payments; necessity of contribution contracts; performance funding system; audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In addition to the contributions authorized to be made for the purposes specified in section 1437c of this title, the Secretary may make annual contributions to public housing agencies for the operation of low-income housing projects. The contributions payable annually under this section shall not exceed the amounts which the Secretary determines are required (i) to assure the lower income character of the projects involved, and (ii) to achieve and maintain adequate operating services and reserve funds. The Secretary shall embody the provisions for such annual contributions in a contract guaranteeing their payment subject to the availability of funds, and such contract shall provide that no disposition of the low-income housing project, with respect to which the contract is entered into, shall occur during and for ten years after the period when contributions were made pursuant to such contract unless approved by the Secretary. If the Secretary determines that a public housing agency has failed to take the actions required to submit an acceptable audit on a timely basis in accordance with chapter 75 of title 31, the Secretary may arrange for, and pay the costs of, the audit. In such circumstances, the Secretary may withhold, from assistance otherwise payable to the agency under this section, amounts sufficient to pay for the reasonable costs of conducting an acceptable audit, including, when appropriate, the reasonable costs of accounting services necessary to place the agency's books and records in auditable condition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Annual contributions under this section to any public housing agency for any project with a sufficient number of residents who are frail elderly or persons with disabilities may be used, with respect to such project, for (I) the cost of a management staff member to coordinate the provision of any services within the project provided through any agency of the Federal Government or any other public or private department, agency, or organization to residents of the project who are frail elderly or persons with disabilities to enable such residents to live independently and prevent placement in nursing homes or institutions; and (II) expenses for the provision of services for such residents of the project to enable such residents to live independently and prevent placement in nursing homes or institutions, which may include meal services, housekeeping and chore assistance, personal care, laundry assistance, transportation services, and health-related services, except that not more than 15 percent of the cost of the provision of such services may be provided under this section. For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;frail elderly&rdquo; shall have the meaning given the term under section 1701q(d) of title 12, except that such term does not include any person receiving assistance provided under the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 [42 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.] or section 8011 of this title, and the term &ldquo;persons with disabilities&rdquo; shall have the meaning given the term under section 8013 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Annual contributions under this section to any public housing agency for any project may be used, with respect to such project, for (I) the cost of employing or otherwise retaining the services of one or more service coordinators under section 661&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437g_1_target" name="1437g_1">1</a></sup> of the Housing and Commu<!-- PDFPage:2520 -->nity Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13631] to coordinate the provision of any supportive services within the project for residents of the project who are elderly families and disabled families, and (II) expenses for the provision of such services for such residents of the project. Not more than 15 percent of the cost of the provision of such services may be provided under this section. Services may not be provided under this clause for any person receiving assistance under the Congregate Housing Services Act of 1978 [42 U.S.C. 8001 et seq.] or section 8011 of this title. The budget authority available under section 1437c(c) of this title for assistance under this section is authorized to be increased by $30,000,000 on or after October 1, 1992, and by $30,000,000 on or after October 1, 1993. Amounts made available under this clause shall be used to provide additional annual contributions to public housing agencies only for the purpose of providing service coordinators and services under this clause for public housing projects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not make assistance available under this section for any low-income housing project unless such project is one developed pursuant to a contributions contract authorized by section 1437c of this title but not subject to section 1437f of this title, except that after the duration of any such contributions contract with respect to a low-income housing project, the Secretary may provide assistance under this section with respect to such project as long as the lower income nature of such project is maintained.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) For purposes of making payments under this section (except for payments under paragraph (1)(B)), the Secretary shall utilize a performance funding system that is substantially based on the system defined in regulations and in effect on February 5, 1988 (as modified by this paragraph), and that establishes standards for costs of operation and reasonable projections of income, taking into account the character and location of the project and the characteristics of the families served, in accordance with a formula representing the operations of a prototype well-managed project. Such performance funding system shall be established in consultation with public housing agencies and their associations, be contained in a regulation promulgated by the Secretary prior to the start of any fiscal year to which it applies, and remain in effect for the duration of such fiscal year without change. Notwithstanding the preceding sentences, the Secretary shall revise the performance funding system by June 15, 1988, to accurately reflect the increase in insurance costs incurred by public housing agencies. Notwithstanding sections 583(a) and 585(a)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437g_2_target" name="1437g_2">2</a></sup> of title 5 (as added by section 3(a) of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990), any proposed regulation providing for amendment, alteration, adjustment, or other change to the performance funding system relating to vacant public housing units shall be issued pursuant to a negotiated rulemaking procedure under subchapter IV&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437g_2_target" name="1437g_2">2</a></sup> of chapter 5 of such title (as added by section 3(a) of the Negotiated Rulemaking Act of 1990), and the Secretary shall establish a negotiated rulemaking committee for development of any such proposed regulations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) In determining whether an agency is &ldquo;troubled with respect to the modernization program&rdquo;, the Department shall consider only the agency's ability to carry out that program effectively based upon the agency's capacity to accomplish the physical work: (a) with decent quality; (b) in a timely manner; (c) under competent contract administration; and (d) with adequate budget controls.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any fiscal year the Secretary may, pursuant to the request of a troubled agency, increase the amount allocated to the agency under subparagraph (A) to an amount not exceeding the amount that would be allocated to the agency in such fiscal year if the agency were not a troubled agency. An increase under this subparagraph shall be based on the agency's progress toward meeting the performance indicators under section 1437d(j)(1) of this title. The Secretary shall render a decision in writing on each such request not later than 75 days after receipt of the request and any necessary supporting documentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For any fiscal year, any amounts that would have been allocated to an agency under the formula under paragraph (2) that are not allocated to the agency because the agency receives the amount provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, shall be allocated in such year pursuant to the formula to other agencies with 250 or more units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall carry out a credit system under this subparagraph to provide agencies that receive allocations under subparagraph (A) with additional assistance under this section after the agency is determined not to be a troubled agency, to compensate for amounts not received because of the troubled agency designation. The credit system shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Any agency that receives assistance pursuant to subparagraph (A) for any fiscal year shall receive credits for the difference between the amount that the agency would have been allocated in such year if it were not designated a troubled agency and the amount allocated for the agency for such year under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) An agency may not receive credits under this subparagraph for more than 3 consecutive fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) After a 3-year period during which an agency has accrued credits, the credits accrued by the agency shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) decreased by 10 percent of the total credits accumulated if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the first fiscal year after such 3-year period of accrual of credits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) decreased by an additional 20 percent of the original total accumulated credits if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the second fiscal year after such 3-year accrual period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) decreased by an additional 30 percent of the original total accumulated credits if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the third fiscal year after such 3-year accrual period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) eliminated if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the fourth fiscal year after such 3-year accrual period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) After a determination by the Secretary that an agency is not a troubled agency, the Secretary shall provide the agency with amounts made available under this clause in accordance with the amount of credits accumulated by the agency (subject to the reductions under clause (iii)). Such amounts shall be provided in addition to the amounts allocated to the agency pursuant to the formula under paragraph (2). In each fiscal year, the Secretary shall reserve from amounts available for allocation under paragraph (2)(A) the amount necessary to provide assistance pursuant to such credits, except that the reserved amount may not exceed 5 percent of the total amount available for allocation under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) In making payments for accrued credits in accordance with clause (iv), the Secretary may take into account the ability of the agency to expeditiously expend amounts received for credits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any amounts (A) allocated under paragraph (4) that become available for reallocation be<!-- PDFPage:2532 -->cause an agency does not qualify to receive all or a part of its formula allocation due to failure to comply with the requirements of this section (other than because of designation as a troubled agency), and (B) recaptured by the Secretary for good cause, shall (subject to approval in appropriations Acts) be reallocated by the Secretary in the next fiscal year to other housing agencies that own or operate 250 or more units, based on their relative needs. The relative needs of agencies shall be measured by the formula established pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A public housing agency may appeal the amount of its allocation determined under the formula on the basis of unique circumstances or on the basis that the objectively measurable data regarding the agency, community, and project characteristics used for determining the formula amount were not correct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Amounts allocated to a public housing agency under paragraph (3) or (4) may be used for any eligible activity in accordance with this section, notwithstanding that the allocation amount is determined by allocating half based on relative backlog needs and half based on relative accrued needs of agencies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) 80 percent shall be available for carrying out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Other uses of modernization and development assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition to the purposes enumerated in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, a public housing agency may use modernization assistance provided under this section, and development assistance provided under section 1437c(a) of this title that was not allocated, as determined by the Secretary, for priority replacement housing, for any eligible activity authorized by this section, by section 1437c of this title, or by applicable Appropriations Acts for a public housing agency, including the demolition, rehabilitation, revitalization, and replacement of existing units and projects and, for up to 10 percent of its allocation of such funds in any fiscal year, for any operating subsidy purpose authorized in section 1437g of this title.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Units shall be made available in such developments for periods of not less than 20 years, by master contract or by individual lease, for occupancy by low-income and very low-income families referred from time to time by the public housing agency. The number of such units shall be:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the same proportion to the total number of units in such development that the total financial commitment provided by the public housing agency bears to the value <!-- PDFPage:2534 -->of the total financial commitment in the development, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not be less than the number of units that could have been developed under the conventional public housing program with the assistance involved, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) as may otherwise be approved by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not approve an application by a public housing agency for permission, with or without financial assistance under this chapter, to demolish or dispose of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project unless the Secretary has determined that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of an application proposing demolition of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project, the project or portion of the project is obsolete as to physical condition, location, or other factors, making it unusable for housing purposes, and no reasonable program of modifications is feasible to return the project or portion of the project to useful life; or in the case of an application proposing the demolition of only a portion of a project, the demolition will help to assure the useful life of the remaining portion of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an application proposing disposition of real property of a public housing agency by sale or other transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the property's retention is not in the best interests of the tenants or the public housing agency because developmental changes in the area surrounding the project adversely affect the health or safety of the tenants or the feasible operation of the project by the public housing agency, because disposition allows the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties which will be more efficiently or effectively operated as low-income housing projects and which will preserve the total amount of low-income housing stock available in the community, or because of other factors which the Secretary determines are consistent with the best interests of the tenants and public housing agency and which are not inconsistent with other provisions of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for property other than dwelling units, the property is excess to the needs of a project or the disposition is incidental to, or does not interfere with, continued operation of a project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the net proceeds of the disposition will be used for (i) the payment of development cost for the project and for the retirement of outstanding obligations issued to finance original development or modernization of the project, which, in the case of scattered-site housing of a public housing agency, shall be in an amount that bears the same ratio to the total of such costs and obligations as the number of units disposed of bears to the total number of units of the project at the time of disposition, and (ii) to the extent that any proceeds remain after the application of proceeds in accordance with clause (i), the provision of housing assistance for low-income families through such measures as modernization of low-in<!-- PDFPage:2542 -->come housing, or the acquisition, development, or rehabilitation of other properties to operate as low-income housing; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of an application proposing demolition or disposition of any portion of a public housing project, assisted at any time under section 1437c(j)(2) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such assistance has not been provided for the portion of the project to be demolished or disposed within the 10-year period ending upon submission of the application; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the property's retention is not in the best interest of the tenants or the public housing agency because of extraordinary changes in the area surrounding the project or other extraordinary circumstances of the project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Consultation with tenants and tenant councils; opportunity to purchase; relocation assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not approve an application or furnish assistance under this section or under this chapter unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the application from the public housing agency has been developed in consultation with tenants and tenant councils, if any, who will be affected by the demolition or disposition, and the tenant councils, resident management corporation, and tenant cooperative of the project or portion of the project covered by the application, if any, have been given appropriate opportunities to purchase the project or portion of the project covered by the application, and contains a certification by appropriate local government officials that the proposed activity is consistent with the applicable housing assistance plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) all tenants to be displaced as a result of the demolition or disposition will be given assistance by the public housing agency and are relocated to other decent, safe, sanitary, and affordable housing, which is, to the maximum extent practicable, housing of their choice, including housing assisted under section 1437f of this title, and the public housing agency provides for the payment of the relocation expenses of each tenant to be displaced, ensures that the rent paid by the tenant following relocation will not exceed the amount permitted under this chapter and shall not commence demolition or disposition of any unit until the tenant of the unit is relocated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Financial assistance; contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary is authorized to make available financial assistance for applications approved under this section using available contributions authorized under section 1437c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Conditions for agency action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A public housing agency shall not take any action to demolish or dispose of a public housing project or a portion of a public housing project without obtaining the approval of the Secretary and satisfying the conditions specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section: <em>Provided</em>, That nothing in this section shall prevent a public housing agency from consolidating occupancy within or among buildings of a public housing project, or among projects, or with other housing for the purpose of improving the living conditions of or providing more efficient services to its tenants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Set-asides for replacement housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In each of fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary may reserve from any budget authority appropriated for such year for assistance under section 1437f of this title that is available for families not currently receiving such assistance not more than 10 percent of such budget authority for providing replacement housing for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In each of fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary may reserve from any budget authority appropriated for such year for development of public housing under section 1437c(a)(2) of this title not more than the lesser of 30 percent of such budget authorization or $150,000,000, for providing replacement housing for units demolished or disposed of pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Construction on original site or in same neighborhood</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, replacement housing units for public housing units demolished may be built on the original public housing site or in the same neighborhood if the number of such replacement units is significantly fewer than the number of units demolished. No one may rely on the preceding sentence as the basis for reconsidering a final order of a court issued, or a settlement approved, by a court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applicability to disposition of public housing project in accordance with approved homeownership program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply to the disposition of a public housing project in accordance with an approved homeownership program under subchapter II&ndash;A of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to encourage increased resident management of public housing projects, as a means of improving existing living conditions in public housing projects, by providing increased flexibility for public housing projects that are managed by residents by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) permitting the retention, and use for certain purposes, of any revenues exceeding operating and project costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing funding, from amounts otherwise available, for technical assistance to promote formation and development of resident management entities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;public housing project&rdquo; includes one or more contiguous buildings or an area of contiguous row houses the elected resident councils of which approve the establishment of a resident management corporation and otherwise meet the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">As a condition of entering into a resident management program, the elected resident council of a public housing project shall approve the establishment of a resident management corporation. When such approval is made by the elected resident council of a building or row house area, the resident management program shall not interfere with the rights of other families residing in the project or harm the efficient operation of the project. The resident management corporation and the resident council may be the same organization, if the organization complies with the requirements applicable to both the corporation and council. The corporation shall be a nonprofit corporation organized under the laws of the State in which the project is located, and the tenants of the project shall be the sole voting members of the corporation. If there is no elected resident council, a majority of the households of the public housing project shall approve the establishment of a resident council to determine the feasibility of establishing a resident management corporation to manage the project.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Management responsibilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A resident management corporation that qualifies under this section, and that supplies insurance and bonding or equivalent protection sufficient to the Secretary and the public housing agency, shall enter into a contract with the public housing agency establishing the respective management rights and responsibilities of the corporation and the public housing agency. Such contract shall be consistent with the requirements of this chapter applicable to public housing projects and may include specific terms governing management personnel and compensation, access to public housing project records, submission of and adherence to budgets, rent collection procedures, tenant income verification, tenant eligibility determinations, tenant eviction, the acquisition of supplies and materials, and such other matters as may be appropriate.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the total income of a public housing agency (including the operating subsidy provided to the public housing agency under section 1437g of this title) is reduced or increased, the income provided by the public housing agency to a public housing project managed by a resident management corporation shall be reduced or increased in proportion to the reduction or increase in the total income of the public housing agency, except that any reduction in operating subsidy that occurs as a result of fraud, waste, or mismanagement by the public housing agency shall not affect the funds provided to the resident management corporation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Retention of excess revenues</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Any income generated by a resident management corporation of a public housing project that exceeds the income estimated for purposes of this subsection shall be excluded in subsequent years in calculating (i) the operating subsidies provided to the public housing agency under section 1437g of this title; and (ii) the funds provided by the public housing agency to the resident management corporation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any revenues retained by a resident management corporation under subparagraph (A) shall be used for purposes of improving the maintenance and operation of the public housing project, for establishing business enterprises that employ residents of public housing, or for acquiring additional dwelling units for low-income families.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of the Family Self-Sufficiency program established under this section is to promote the development of local strategies to coordinate use of public housing and assistance under the certificate and voucher programs under section 1437f of this title with public and private resources, to enable eligible families to achieve economic independence and self-sufficiency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Required programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall carry out a program under which each public housing agency that administers assistance under subsection (b) or (<em>o</em>) of section 1437f of this title or makes available new public housing dwelling units&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may, during fiscal years 1991 and 1992, carry out a local Family Self-Sufficiency program under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) effective on October 1, 1992, the Secretary shall require each such agency to carry out a local Family Self-Sufficiency program under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each local program shall, subject to availability of supportive services, include an action plan under subsection (g) of this section and shall provide comprehensive supportive services for families electing to participate in the program. In carrying out the self-sufficiency program under this section, the Secretary shall consult with the heads of other appropriate Federal agencies and provide for cooperative actions and funding agreements with such agencies. Each public housing agency administering an approved local program may employ a service coordinator to administer the local program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall not require a public housing agency to carry out a local program under subsection (a) of this section if the public housing agency provides certification (as such term is defined under title I of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12701 et seq.]) to the Secretary, that the establishment and operation of the program is not feasible because of local circumstances, which may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) lack of supportive services accessible to eligible families, which shall include insufficient availability of resources for programs under the Job Training Partnerships&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437u_1_target" name="1437u_1">1</a></sup> Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.] or the Job Opportunities and Basic Skills Training Program under part F&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437u_2_target" name="1437u_2">2</a></sup> of title IV of the Social Security Act;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In allocating assistance available for reservation under this chapter, the Secretary may not refuse to provide assistance or decrease the amount of assistance that would otherwise be provided to any public housing agency because the agency has provided a certification under this paragraph or because, pursuant to a certification, the agency has failed to carry out a self-sufficiency program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency required to carry out a local program under this section shall make the following housing assistance available under the program in each fiscal year:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Certificate and voucher assistance under section 1437f(b) and (<em>o</em>) of this title, in an amount equivalent to the increase for such year in the number of families so assisted by the agency (as compared to the preceding year).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Public housing dwelling units, in the number equal to the increase for such year in units made available by the agency (as compared to the preceding year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Each such public housing agency shall continue to operate a local program for the number of families determined under this paragraph subject only to the availability under appropriations Acts of sufficient amounts for assistance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Nonparticipation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Assistance under the certificate or voucher programs under section 1437f of this title for a family that elects not to participate in a local program shall not be delayed by reason of such election.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contract of participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency carrying out a local program under this section shall enter into a contract with each leaseholder receiving assistance under the certificate and voucher programs of the public housing agency under section 1437f of this title or residing in public housing administered by the agency, that elects to participate in the self-sufficiency program under this section. The contract shall set forth the provisions of the local program, shall establish specific interim and final goals by which compliance with and performance of the contract may be measured, and shall specify the resources and supportive services to be made available to the participating family pursuant to paragraph (2) and the responsibilities of the participating fam<!-- PDFPage:2553 -->ily. The contract shall provide that the public housing agency may terminate or withhold assistance under section 1437f of this title and services under paragraph (2) of this subsection if the public housing agency determines, through an administrative grievance procedure in accordance with the requirements of section 1437d(k) of this title, that the family has failed to comply with the requirements of the contract without good cause (which may include a loss or reduction in access to supportive services, or a change in circumstances that makes the family or individual unsuitable for participation).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Supportive services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A local program under this section shall provide appropriate supportive services under this paragraph to each participating family entering into a contract of participation under paragraph (1). The supportive services shall be provided during the period the family is receiving assistance under section 1437f of this title or residing in public housing, and may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) child care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) transportation necessary to receive services;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Term and extension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each family participating in a local program shall be required to fulfill its obligations under the contract of participation not later than 5 years after entering into the contract. The public housing agency shall extend the term of the contract for any family that requests an extension, upon a finding of the agency of good cause.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Employment and counseling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The contract of participation shall require the head of the participating family to seek suitable employment during the term of the contract. The public housing agency may, during such period, provide counseling for the family with respect to affordable rental and homeownership opportunities in the private housing market and money management counseling.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Incentives for participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maximum rents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the term of the contract of participation, the amount of rent paid by any participating family whose monthly adjusted income does not exceed 50 percent of the area median income for occupancy in the public housing unit or dwelling unit assisted under section 1437f of this title may not be increased on the basis of any increase in the earned income of the family, unless the increase results in an income exceeding 50 percent of the area median income. The Secretary shall provide for increased rents for participating families whose incomes are between 50 and 80 percent of the area median income, so that any family whose income increases to 80 percent or more of the area median income pays 30 percent of the family's monthly adjusted income for rent. Upon completion of the contract of participation, if the participating family continues to qualify for and reside in a dwelling unit in public housing or housing assisted under section 1437f of this title, the rent charged the participating family shall be increased (if applicable) to 30 percent of the monthly adjusted income of the family.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Escrow savings accounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each participating family whose monthly adjusted income is less than 50 percent of the area median income, the difference between 30 percent of the adjusted income of the participating family and the amount of rent paid by a participating family shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account established by the public housing agency on behalf of the participating family. For families with incomes between 50 and 80 percent of the area median income, the Secretary shall provide for escrow of the difference between 30 percent of the family income and the amount paid by the family for rent as determined by the Secretary under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall not escrow any amounts for any family whose adjusted income exceeds 80 percent of the area median income. Amounts in the escrow account may be withdrawn by the participating family after the family ceases to receive income assistance under Federal or State welfare programs, upon successful performance of the obligations of the family under the contract of participation entered into by the family under subsection (c) of this section, as determined according to the specific goals and terms included in the contract, and under other circumstances in which the Secretary determines an exception for good cause is warranted. A public housing agency establishing such escrow accounts may make certain amounts in the accounts available to the participating families before full performance of the contract obligations based on compliance with, and completion of, specific interim goals included in the contract; except that any such amounts shall be used by the participating families for purposes consistent with the contracts of participation, as determined by the public housing agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437u_3_target" name="1437u_3">3</a></sup> Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each public housing agency carrying out a local program under this section shall establish a plan to offer incentives to families to encourage families to participate in the program. The plan shall require the establishment of escrow savings accounts under paragraph (2) and may include any other incentives designed by the public housing agency.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2554 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(3)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437u_3_target" name="1437u_3">3</a></sup> Use of escrow savings accounts for section 1437f homeownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (3), a family that uses assistance under section 1437f(y) of this title to purchase a dwelling may use up to 50 percent of the amount in its escrow account established under paragraph (3) for a downpayment on the dwelling. In addition, after the family purchases the dwelling, the family may use any amounts remaining in the escrow account to cover the costs of major repair and replacement needs of the dwelling. If a family defaults in connection with the loan to purchase a dwelling and the mortgage is foreclosed, the remaining amounts in the escrow account shall be recaptured by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effect of increases in family income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any increase in the earned income of a family during the participation of the family in a local program established under this section may not be considered as income or a resource for purposes of eligibility of the family for other benefits, or amount of benefits payable to the family, under any program administered by the Secretary, unless the income of the family equals or exceeds 80 percent of the median income of the area (as determined by the Secretary with adjustments for smaller and larger families).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Opportunity to cure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any lender that provides financing in connection with a homeownership program under this subchapter shall give the public housing agency, resident management corporation, individual owner, or other appropriate entity a reasonable opportunity to cure a financial default before foreclosing on the property, or taking other action as a result of the default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Housing quality standards</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval of housing assistance application for areas not subject to approved plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For areas in which an approved local housing assistance plan is not applicable the Secretary shall not approve an application for housing assistance unless he determines that there is a need for such assistance, taking into consideration any applicable State housing plans, and that there is or will be available in the area public facilities and services adequate to serve the housing proposed to be assisted.

In allocating assistance under this paragraph for each program of housing assistance under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall apply the formula, to the extent practicable, in a manner so that the assistance under the program is allocated according to the particular relative needs under the preceding sentence that are characteristic of and related to the particular type of assistance provided under the program. Assistance under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 [12 U.S.C. 1701q] shall be allocated in a manner that ensures that awards of the assistance under such section are made for projects of sufficient size to accommodate facilities for supportive services appropriate to the needs of frail elderly residents. The preceding sentence shall not apply to projects acquired from the Resolution Trust Corporation under section 1441a(c) of title 12.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Assistance under section 8(b)(1) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437f(b)(1)] shall be allocated in a manner that enables participating jurisdictions to carry out, to the maximum extent practicable, comprehensive housing affordability strategies approved in accordance with section 105 of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12705].

For purposes of this clause, the term &ldquo;participating jurisdiction&rdquo; means a State or unit of general local government designated by the Secretary to be a participating jurisdiction under title II of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12721 et seq.].</p>

Such amounts shall be allocated on the basis of the formula under subsection (d)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary shall not reserve or obligate assistance subject to allocation under paragraph (1)(A) to specific recipients, unless the assistance is first allocated on the basis of the formula contained in that paragraph and then is reserved and obligated pursuant to a competition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any competition referred to in subparagraph (A) shall be conducted pursuant to specific criteria for the selection of recipients of assistance. The criteria shall be contained in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a regulation promulgated by the Secretary after notice and public comment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to the extent authorized by law, a notice published in the Federal Register.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subject to the times at which appropriations for assistance subject to paragraph (1)(A) may become available for reservation in any fiscal year, the Secretary shall take such steps as the Secretary deems appropriate to ensure that, to the maximum extent practicable, the process referred to in subparagraph (A) is carried out with similar frequency and at similar times for each fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This paragraph shall not apply to assistance referred to in paragraph (4).</p>
