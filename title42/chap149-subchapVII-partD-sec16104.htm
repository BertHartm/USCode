<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) commence a review of the mobile source air emission models of the Environmental Protection Agency used under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) to determine whether the models accurately reflect the emissions resulting from long-duration idling of heavy-duty vehicles and other vehicles and engines; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:7152 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) update those models as the Administrator determines to be appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) commence a review of the emission reductions achieved by the use of idle reduction technology; and</p>
