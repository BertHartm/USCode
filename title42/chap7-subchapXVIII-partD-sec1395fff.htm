<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1395x(v) of this title, the Secretary shall provide, for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after October 1, 2000, for payments for home health services in accordance with a prospective payment system established by the Secretary under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) System of prospective payment for home health services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish under this subsection a prospective payment system for payment for all costs of home health services. Under the system under this subsection all services covered and paid on a reasonable cost basis under the medicare home health benefit as of August 5, 1997, including medical supplies, shall be paid for on the basis of a prospective payment amount determined under this subsection and applicable to the services involved. In implementing the system, the Secretary may provide for a transition (of not longer than 4 years) during which a portion of such payment is based on agency-specific costs, but only if such transition does not result in aggregate payments under this subchapter that exceed the aggregate payments that would be made if such a transition did not occur.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Unit of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In defining a prospective payment amount under the system under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider an appropriate unit of service and the number, type, and duration of visits provided within that unit, potential changes in the mix of services provided within that unit and their cost, and a general system design that provides for continued access to quality services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment basis</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Initial basis</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Under such system the Secretary shall provide for computation of a standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Such amount (or amounts) shall initially be based on the most current audited cost report data available to the Secretary and shall be computed in a manner so that the total amounts payable under the system for the 12-month period beginning on the date the Secretary implements the system shall be equal to the total amount that would have been made if the system had not been in effect and if section 1395x(v)(1)(L)(ix) of this title had not been enacted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) For the 12-month period beginning after the period described in subclause (I), such amount (or amounts) shall be equal to the amount (or amounts) determined under subclause (I), updated under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) For periods beginning after the period described in subclause (II), such amount (or amounts) shall be equal to the amount (or amounts) that would have been determined under subclause (I) that would have been made for fiscal year 2001 if the system had not been in effect and if section 1395x(v)(1)(L)(ix) of this title had not been enacted but if the reduction in limits described in clause (ii) had been in effect, updated under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Each such amount shall be standardized in a manner that eliminates the effect of variations in relative case mix and area wage adjustments among different home health agencies in a budget neutral manner consistent with the case mix and wage level adjustments provided under paragraph (4)(A). Under the system, the Secretary may recognize regional differences or differences based upon whether or not the services or agency are in an urbanized area.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The reduction described in this clause is a reduction by 15 percent in the cost limits and per beneficiary limits described in section 1395x(v)(1)(L) of this title, as those limits are in effect on September 30, 2000.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2449 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Annual update</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) shall be adjusted for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2002) in a prospective manner specified by the Secretary by the home health applicable increase percentage (as defined in clause (ii)) applicable to the fiscal year involved.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Home health applicable increase percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;home health applicable increase percentage&rdquo; means, with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the home health market basket percentage increase (as defined in clause (iii)) minus 1.1 percentage points; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any subsequent fiscal year, the home health market basket percentage increase.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Home health market basket percentage increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;home health market basket percentage increase&rdquo; means, with respect to a fiscal year, a percentage (estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the fiscal year) determined and applied with respect to the mix of goods and services included in home health services in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase under section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title is determined and applied to the mix of goods and services comprising inpatient hospital services for the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Adjustment for case mix changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments under paragraph (4)(A)(i) for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of different units of services that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary may adjust the standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) under paragraph (3) for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment for outliers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall reduce the standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) under this paragraph applicable to home health services furnished during a period by such proportion as will result in an aggregate reduction in payments for the period equal to the aggregate increase in payments resulting from the application of paragraph (5) (relating to outliers).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payment computation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The payment amount for a unit of home health services shall be the applicable standard prospective payment amount adjusted as follows:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Case mix adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount shall be adjusted by an appropriate case mix adjustment factor (established under subparagraph (B)).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Area wage adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The portion of such amount that the Secretary estimates to be attributable to wages and wage-related costs shall be adjusted for geographic differences in such costs by an area wage adjustment factor (established under subparagraph (C)) for the area in which the services are furnished or such other area as the Secretary may specify.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Establishment of case mix adjustment factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish appropriate case mix adjustment factors for home health services in a manner that explains a significant amount of the variation in cost among different units of services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Establishment of area wage adjustment factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish area wage adjustment factors that reflect the relative level of wages and wage-related costs applicable to the furnishing of home health services in a geographic area compared to the national average applicable level. Such factors may be the factors used by the Secretary for purposes of section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Outliers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may provide for an addition or adjustment to the payment amount otherwise made in the case of outliers because of unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care. The total amount of the additional payments or payment adjustments made under this paragraph with respect to a fiscal year may not exceed 5 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on the prospective payment system under this subsection in that year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Proration of prospective payment amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a beneficiary elects to transfer to, or receive services from, another home health agency within the period covered by the prospective payment amount, the payment shall be prorated between the home health agencies involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for payment information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to home health services furnished on or after October 1, 1998, no claim for such a service may be paid under this subchapter unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the claim has the unique identifier (provided under section 1395u(r) of this title) for the physician who prescribed the services or made the certification described in section 1395f(a)(2) or 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a service visit described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of section 1395x(m) of this title, the claim contains a code (or <!-- PDFPage:2450 -->codes) specified by the Secretary that identifies the length of time of the service visit, as measured in 15 minute increments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title, 1395<em>oo</em> of this title, or otherwise of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the establishment of a transition period under subsection (b)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the definition and application of payment units under subsection (b)(2) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the computation of initial standard prospective payment amounts under subsection (b)(3)(A) of this section (including the reduction described in clause (ii) of such subsection);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the establishment of the adjustment for outliers under subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the establishment of case mix and area wage adjustments under subsection (b)(4) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the establishment of any adjustments for outliers under subsection (b)(5) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Construction related to home health services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Telecommunications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a home health agency furnishing a home health unit of service for which payment is made under the prospective payment system established by this section for such units of service from furnishing services via a telecommunication system if such services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) do not substitute for in-person home health services ordered as part of a plan of care certified by a physician pursuant to section 1395f(a)(2)(C) or 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are not considered a home health visit for purposes of eligibility or payment under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Physician certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as waiving the requirement for a physician certification under section 1395f(a)(2)(C) or 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title for the payment for home health services, whether or not furnished via a telecommunications system.</p>
