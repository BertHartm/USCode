<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computerized list maintenance</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Safeguards to ensure that eligible voters are not removed in error from the official list of eligible voters.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Verification of voter registration information</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

To the extent that the State has a computerized list in effect under this subsection and the list assigns unique identifying numbers to registrants, the number assigned under this clause shall be the unique identifying number assigned under the list.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Determination of validity of numbers provided</h4>
