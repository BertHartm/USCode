<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) measures that increase public awareness of suicide as a preventable public health problem, and target parents and youth so that suicide risks and warning signs can be recognized, will help to eliminate the ignorance and stigma of suicide as barriers to youth and families seeking preventive care;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) suicide prevention efforts in the year 2000 should&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) target at-risk youth, particularly youth with mental health problems, substance abuse problems, or contact with the juvenile justice system;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) research of United States youth, such as a 1994 study by Lewinsohn, Rohde, and Seeley, has shown predictors of suicide, such as a history of suicide attempts, current suicidal ideation and depression, a recent attempt or completed suicide by a friend, and low self-esteem; and</p>
