<h4 class="note-head">Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology Development</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 105&ndash;255, Oct. 14, 1998, 112 Stat. 1889, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology Development Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) According to the National Science Foundation's 1996 report, Women, Minorities, and Persons with Disabilities in Science and Engineering&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) women have historically been underrepresented in scientific and engineering occupations, and although progress has been made over the last several decades, there is still room for improvement;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) female and minority students take fewer high-level mathematics and science courses in high school;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) female students earn fewer bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees in science and engineering;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) among recent bachelors of science and bachelors of engineering graduates, women are less likely to be in the labor force, to be employed full-time, and to be employed in their field than are men;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) among doctoral scientists and engineers, women are far more likely to be employed at 2-year institutions, are far less likely to be employed in research universities, and are much more likely to teach part-time;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) among university full-time faculty, women are less likely to chair departments or hold high-ranked positions;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) a substantial salary gap exists between men and women with doctorates in science and engineering;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(H) Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans continue to be seriously underrepresented in graduate science and engineering programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(I) Blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans as a group are 23 percent of the population of the United States, but only 6 percent are scientists or engineers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) According to the National Research Council's 1995 report, Women Scientists and Engineers Employed in Industry: Why So Few?&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) limited access is the first hurdle faced by women seeking industrial jobs in science and engineering, and while progress has been made in recent years, common recruitment and hiring practices that make extensive use of traditional networks often overlook the available pool of women;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) once on the job, many women find paternalism, sexual harassment, allegations of reverse discrimination, different standards for judging the work of men and women, lower salary relative to their male peers, inequitable job assignments, and other aspects of a male-oriented culture that are hostile to women; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) women to a greater extent than men find limited opportunities for advancement, particularly for moving into management positions, and the number of women who have achieved the top levels in corporations is much lower than would be expected, based on the pipeline model.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The establishment of a commission to examine issues raised by the findings of these two reports would help&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to focus attention on the importance of eliminating artificial barriers to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women and minorities in the fields of science, engineering, and technology, and in all employment sectors of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to promote work force diversity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) to sensitize employers to the need to recruit and retain women and minority scientists, engineers, and computer specialists; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) to encourage the replication of successful recruitment and retention programs by universities, corporations, and Federal agencies having difficulties in employing women or minorities in the fields of science, engineering, and technology.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;There is established a commission to be known as the &lsquo;Commission on the Advancement of Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering, and Technology Development&rsquo; (in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Commission&rsquo;).</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 4. DUTY OF THE COMMISSION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Commission shall review available research, and, if determined necessary by the Commission, conduct additional research to&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) examine the preparedness of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) pursue careers in science, engineering, and technology development; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) advance to positions of greater responsibility within academia, industry, and government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) describe the practices and policies of employers and labor unions relating to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in the fields of science, engineering, and technology development;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) identify the opportunities for, and artificial barriers to, the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in the fields of science, engineering, and technology development in academia, industry, and government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) compile a synthesis of available research on lawful practices, policies, and programs that have <!-- PDFPage:3755 -->successfully led to the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in science, engineering, and technology development;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) issue recommendations with respect to lawful policies that government (including Congress and appropriate Federal agencies), academia, and private industry can follow regarding the recruitment, retention, and advancement of women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in science, engineering, and technology development;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) identify the disincentives for women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities to continue graduate education in the fields of engineering, physics, and computer science;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) compile a list of all federally funded reports on the subjects of encouraging women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities to enter the fields of science and engineering and retaining women, minorities, and individuals with disabilities in the science and engineering workforce that have been issued since the date that the Task Force described in paragraph (10) submitted its report to Congress;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) assess the extent to which the recommendations contained in the reports described in paragraph (11) have been implemented; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) evaluate the benefits of family-friendly policies in order to assist recruiting, retaining, and advancing women in the fields of science, engineering, and technology such as the benefits or disadvantages of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (29 U.S.C. 2001 et seq.
