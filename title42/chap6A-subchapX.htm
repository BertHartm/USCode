<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) made by a trauma center that, with respect to the system described in section 300d&ndash;41(b)(2) of this title in which the center is a participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is providing trauma care in a geographic area in which the availability of trauma care has significantly decreased as a result of a trauma center in the area permanently ceasing participation in such system as of a date occurring during the 2-year period specified in section 300d&ndash;41(b)(1)(B) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will, in providing trauma care during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the application for the grant is submitted, incur uncompensated costs in an amount rendering the center unable to continue participation in such system, resulting in a significant decrease in the availability of trauma care in the geographic area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further preference for certain applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to applications for grants under section 300d&ndash;41 of this title that are receiving preference for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall give further preference to any such application made by a trauma center for which a disproportionate percentage of the uncompensated costs of the center result from the provision of trauma care to individuals who neither are citizens nor aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;194, &sect;2, Dec. 19, 2003, 117 Stat. 2888, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Poison control centers are our Nation's primary defense against injury and deaths from poisoning. Twenty-four hours a day, the general public as well as health care practitioners contact their local poison centers for help in diagnosing and treating victims of poisoning and other toxic exposures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Poisoning is the third most common form of unintentional death in the United States. In any given year, there will be between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 poison exposures. More than 50 percent of these exposures will involve children under the age of 6 who are exposed to toxic substances in their home. Poisoning accounts for 285,000 hospitalizations, 1,200,000 days of acute hospital care, and 13,000 fatalities annually.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Stabilizing the funding structure and increasing accessibility to poison control centers will promote the utilization of poison control centers, and reduce the inappropriate use of emergency medical services and other more costly health care services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The tragic events of September 11, 2001, and the anthrax cases of October 2001, have dramatically changed our Nation. During this time period, poison centers in many areas of the country were answering thousands of additional calls from concerned residents. Many poison centers were relied upon as a source for accurate medical information about the disease and the complications resulting from prophylactic antibiotic therapy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The 2001 Presidential Task Force on Citizen Preparedness in the War on Terrorism recommended that the Poison Control Centers be used as a source of public information and public education regarding potential biological, chemical, and nuclear domestic terrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The increased demand placed upon poison centers to provide emergency information in the event of a terrorist event involving a biological, chemical, or nuclear toxin will dramatically increase call volume.&rdquo;</p>
