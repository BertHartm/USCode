<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provide the voter with the opportunity (in a private and independent manner) to change the ballot or correct any error before the ballot is cast and counted (including the opportunity to correct the error through the issuance of a replacement ballot if the voter was otherwise unable to change the ballot or correct any error); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the total combination of mechanical, electromechanical, or electronic equipment (including the software, firmware, and documentation required to program, control, and support the equipment) that is used&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to define ballots;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to cast and count votes;</p>
