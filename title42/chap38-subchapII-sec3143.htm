<p class="statutory-body">Funds obtained by the Secretary under section 3141 of this title, loan funds obtained under section 3171 of this title, and collections and repayments received under this chapter, shall be deposited in an economic development revolving fund (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;fund&rdquo;), which is hereby established in the Treasury of the United States, and which shall be available to the Secretary for the purpose of extending financial assistance under sections 3141, 3142, and 3171 of this title, and for the payment of all obligations and expenditures arising in connection therewith. There shall also be credited to the fund such funds as have been paid into the area redevelopment fund or may be received from obligations outstanding under the Area Redevelopment Act [42 U.S.C. 2501 et seq.]. The fund shall pay into miscellaneous receipts of the Treasury, following the close of each fiscal year, interest on the amount of loans outstanding under this chapter computed in such manner and at such rate as may be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States with remaining periods to maturity comparable to the average maturities of such loans, adjusted to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, during the month of September preceding the fiscal year in which the loans were made.</p>
