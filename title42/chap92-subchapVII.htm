<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty against any person under this chapter, the Secretary shall provide to such person notice of the proposed penalty. Such notice shall inform such person of his opportunity to elect in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice to have the procedures of paragraph (3) (in lieu of those of paragraph (2)) apply with respect to such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Unless an election is made within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice under paragraph (1) to have paragraph (3) apply with respect to such penalty, the Secretary shall assess the penalty, by order, after a determination of violation has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant to section 554 of title 5 before an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. Such assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's findings and the basis for such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this paragraph may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the Secretary assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United States court of appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary, or the court may remand the proceeding to the Secretary for such further action as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the procedures of this paragraph have been elected, the Secretary shall promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of the notice under paragraph (1) of the proposed penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the civil penalty has not been paid within 60 calendar days after the assessment order has been made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall institute an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for an order affirming the assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to review de novo the law and the facts involved, and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, such assessment.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4664 --><p class="statutory-body">(C) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (2), or after the appropriate district court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall institute an action to recover the amount of such penalty in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of title 28, or of section 7192(c) of this title, the Secretary shall be represented by the general counsel of the Department of Energy (or any attorney or attorneys within the Department of Energy designated by the Secretary) who shall supervise, conduct, and argue any civil litigation to which paragraph (3) of this subsection applies (including any related collection action under paragraph (4)) in a court of the United States or in any other court, except the Supreme Court. However, the Secretary or the general counsel shall consult with the Attorney General concerning such litigation, and the Attorney General shall provide, on request, such assistance in the conduct of such litigation as may be appropriate.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8441. Preservation of contractual interest</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Right to transfer contractual interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If any person receives natural gas, the use of which is prohibited by the provisions of sub<!-- PDFPage:4665 -->chapter III of this chapter or any rule or order thereunder, and if such natural gas is received pursuant to a contract in effect on April 20, 1977, between such person and any other person, such person receiving such natural gas may transfer all or any portion of such person's contractual interests under such contract and receive consideration from the person to whom such contractual interests are transferred. The consideration authorized by this subsection shall not exceed the maximum consideration established as just compensation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who would have transported or distributed the natural gas subject to a contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be entitled to receive just compensation (as determined by the Commission) from the person to whom such contractual interests are transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall, by rule, establish guidelines for the application on a regional or national basis (as may be appropriate) of the criteria specified in subsection (e)(1) of this section to determine the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The person transferring contractual interests pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section and the person to whom such interests are transferred may agree on the amount of, or method of determining, the consideration to be paid for such transfer and certify such consideration to the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph (4), such agreed-upon consideration shall not exceed the consideration determined by application of the guidelines prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event the person transferring contractual interests pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section and the person to whom such interests are to be transferred fail to agree, under paragraph (2), on the amount of, or method of determining, the consideration to be paid for such transfer, the Commission may, at the request of both such persons, prescribe the amount of, or method of determining, such consideration. Upon the request of either such person, the Commission shall make such determination on the record, after an opportunity for agency hearing. In any such latter case, the determination of the Commission shall be binding upon the party requesting that such determination be made on the record of the agency hearing. The consideration prescribed by the Commission shall not exceed the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section. In prescribing the amount of, or method of determining, consideration under this paragraph, to the maximum extent practicable, the Commission shall utilize any liquidated damages provision set forth in the applicable contract, but in no event may the Commission prescribe consideration in excess of the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the event that the consideration agreed upon under paragraph (2) exceeds the consideration determined by application of the guidelines prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (1), the Commission may approve such agreed-upon consideration if the Commission determines such agreed-upon consideration does not exceed the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If consideration is agreed upon under paragraph (2) and such consideration exceeds the consideration determined by application of the guidelines prescribed under paragraph (1), but does not exceed the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section, the Commission may not require a refund of any portion of the agreed-upon consideration paid with respect to deliveries of natural gas occurring prior to the Commission's action under paragraph (4) approving or disapproving such consideration unless the Commission determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such agreed-upon consideration was fraudulently established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the processing of the request for approval of such agreed-upon consideration under paragraph (4) was willfully delayed by a party to the transfer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such agreed-upon consideration exceeds the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restrictions on transfers unenforceable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any provision of any contract, which prohibits any transfer authorized by subsection (a)(1) of this section or terminates such contract on the basis of such transfer, shall be unenforceable in any court of the United States and in any court of any State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No State may enforce any prohibition on any transfer authorized by subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contractual obligations unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The person acquiring contractual interests transferred pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall assume the contractual obligations which the person transferring such contractual interests has under such contract. This subsection shall not relieve the person transferring such contractual interests from any contractual obligation of such person under such contract if such obligation is not performed by the person acquiring such contractual interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The term &ldquo;just compensation&rdquo;, when used with respect to any transfer of contractual interests authorized by subsection (a)(1) of this section, means the maximum amount of, or method of determining, consideration which does not exceed the amount by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the reasonable costs (excluding capital costs) incurred, during the remainder of the period of the contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred under subsection (a)(1) of this section, in direct association with the use of a fuel, other than natural gas, as a primary energy source by the applicable existing electric powerplant, exceed</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the price of natural gas under such contract during such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the reasonable costs associated with the use of a fuel, other than natural gas, as a primary energy <!-- PDFPage:4666 -->source shall include an allowance for the amortization, over the remaining useful life, of the undepreciated value of depreciable assets located on the premises containing such electric powerplant, which assets were directly associated with the use of natural gas and are not usable in connection with the use of such other fuel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The term &ldquo;just compensation&rdquo;, when used with respect to subsection (a)(2) of this section, means an amount equal to any loss of revenue, during the remaining period of the contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section, to the extent such loss (A) is directly incurred by reason of the discontinuation of the transportation or distribution of natural gas resulting from the transfer of contractual interests pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section, and (B) is not offset by revenues derived from other transportation or distribution which would not have occurred if such contractual interests had not been transferred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The term &ldquo;contractual interests&rdquo;, with respect to a contract described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, includes the right to receive natural gas as affected by any applicable curtailment plan filed with the Commission or the appropriate State regulatory authority.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Coordination with Natural Gas Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Consideration paid by any interstate pipeline pursuant to this section shall be deemed just and reasonable for purposes of sections 4, 5, and 7 of the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717c, 717d, 717f]. The Commission shall not deny a passthrough by such interstate pipeline of such consideration based upon the amount of such consideration paid pursuant to this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No person shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.] or to regulation as a common carrier under any provision of Federal or State law solely by reason of making any sale, or engaging in any transportation, of natural gas with respect to which the transfer of contractual interests is authorized under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall exempt from the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Natural Gas Act [15 U.S.C. 717 et seq.] any transportation in interstate commerce of natural gas, any sale in interstate commerce for resale of natural gas, or any person engaged in such transportation or such sale to the extent such transportation, sale or person is subject to the juridiction&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8441_1_target" name="8441_1">1</a></sup> of the Commission under such Act without regard to the transfer of contractual interests under subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this section shall exempt any person from any obligation to obtain a certificate of public convenience and necessity for the transportation by an interstate pipeline of natural gas with respect to which the transfer of contractual interests is authorized under subsection (a)(1) of this section. The Commission shall not deny such a certificate for the transportation in interstate commerce of natural gas based upon the amount of consideration paid pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Volume limitation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the volume determined by reference to the maximum delivery obligations specified in such contract;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the volume which such supplier would have been required to supply, under the curtailment plan in effect for such supplier, to the person, who transferred contractual interests under subsection (a)(1) of this section, if no such transfer had occurred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the volume which would have been delivered, or for which payment would have been made, pursuant to such contract but for the prohibition on the use of such natural gas under subchapter III of this chapter or any rule or order thereunder; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President, acting through the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall make a full and complete investigation and study of the alternative national uses of coal available in the United States to meet the Nation's energy requirements consistent with national policies for the protection and enhancement of the quality of the environment and for economic recovery and full employment. In particular the study should identify and evaluate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) current and prospective coal requirements of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) current and prospective voluntary and mandatory energy conservation measures and their potential for reduction of the United States coal requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) current and prospective coal resource production, transportation, conversion, and utilization requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent and adequacy of coal research, development, and demonstration programs being carried out by Federal, State, local, and nongovernmental entities (including financial resources, manpower, and statutory authority);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) programs for the development of coal mining technologies which increase coal production and utilization while protecting the health and safety of coal miners;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) alternative strategies for meeting anticipated United States coal requirements, consistent with achieving other national goals, including national security and environmental protection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) existing and prospective governmental policies and laws affecting the coal industry with the view of determining what, if any, changes in and implementation of such policies and laws may be advisable in order to consolidate, coordinate, and provide an effective and equitable national energy policy consistent with other national policies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the most efficient use of the Nation's coal resources considering economic (including capital and consumer costs, and balance of payments), social (including employment), environmental, technological, national defense, and other aspects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 18 months after the effective date of this chapter, the President shall submit to the Congress a report with respect to the studies and investigations, together with findings and recommendations in order that the Congress may have such information in a timely fashion. Such report shall include the President's determinations and recommendations with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Nation's projected coal needs nationally and regionally, for the next 2 decades with particular reference to electric power;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the coal resources available or which must be developed to meet those needs, including, as applicable, the programs for research, development, and demonstration necessary to provide technological advances which may greatly enhance the Nation's ability to efficiently and economically utilize its fuel resources, consistent with applicable environmental requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the air, water, and other pollution created by coal requirements, including any programs to overcome promptly and efficiently any technological or economic barriers to the elimination of such pollution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the existing policies and programs of the Federal Government and of State and local governments, which have any significant impact on the availability, production or efficient and economic utilization of coal resources and on the ability to meet the Nation's energy needs and environmental requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the adequacy of various transportation systems, including roads, railroads, and waterways to meet projected increases in coal production and utilization.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before submitting a report to the Congress under subsection (b) of this section, the President shall publish in the Federal Register a notice and summary of the proposed report, make copies of such report available, and accord interested persons an opportunity (of not less than 90 days&rsquo; duration) to present written comments; and shall make such modifications of such report as he may consider appropriate on the basis of such comments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for allocation between the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency for fiscal years 1979 and 1980, not to exceed $18,000,000, for use in carrying out the purposes of this section.</p>
