<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 2 years after October 24, 1992, the Secretary, after consulting with appropriate Federal agencies, CABO, ASHRAE, the National Association of Home Builders, the Illuminating Engineering Society, the American Institute of Architects, the National Conference of the States on Building Codes and Standards, and other appropriate persons, shall establish, by rule, Federal building energy standards that require in new Federal buildings those energy efficiency measures that are technologically feasible and economically justified. Such standards shall become effective no later than 1 year after such rule is issued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standards established under paragraph (1) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) contain energy saving and renewable energy specifications that meet or exceed the energy saving and renewable energy specifications of the 2004 International Energy Conservation Code (in the case of residential buildings) or ASHRAE Standard 90.1&ndash;2004 (in the case of commercial buildings);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to the extent practicable, use the same format as the appropriate voluntary building energy code; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) consider, in consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency and other Federal agencies, and where appropriate contain, measures with regard to radon and other indoor air pollutants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Not later than 1 year after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall establish, by rule, revised Federal building energy efficiency performance standards that require that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) if life-cycle cost-effective for new Federal buildings&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the buildings be designed to achieve energy consumption levels that are at least 30 percent below the levels established in the version of the ASHRAE Standard or the International Energy Conservation Code, as appropriate, that is in effect as of August 8, 2005; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) sustainable design principles are applied to the siting, design, and construction of all new and replacement buildings; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if water is used to achieve energy efficiency, water conservation technologies shall be applied to the extent that the technologies are life-cycle cost-effective.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than 1 year after the date of approval of each subsequent revision of the ASHRAE Standard or the International Energy Conservation Code, as appropriate, the Secretary shall determine, based on the cost-effectiveness of the requirements under the amendment, whether the revised standards established under this paragraph should be updated to reflect the amendment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the budget request of the Federal agency for each fiscal year and each report submitted by the Federal agency under section 8258(a) of this title, the head of each Federal agency shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a list of all new Federal buildings owned, operated, or controlled by the Federal agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a statement specifying whether the Federal buildings meet or exceed the revised standards established under this paragraph.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5222 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall periodically, but not less than once every 5 years, review the Federal building energy standards established under this section and shall, if significant energy savings would result, upgrade such standards to include all new energy efficiency and renewable energy measures that are technologically feasible and economically justified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Interim standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Interim energy performance standards for new Federal buildings issued by the Secretary under this subchapter as it existed before October 24, 1992, shall remain in effect until the standards established under subsection (a) of this section become effective.</p>
