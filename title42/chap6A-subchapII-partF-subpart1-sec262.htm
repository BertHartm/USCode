<p class="statutory-body-5em">(cc) a clinical study or studies (including the assessment of immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics) that are sufficient to demonstrate safety, purity, and potency in 1 or more appropriate conditions of use for which the reference product is licensed and intended <!-- PDFPage:357 -->to be used and for which licensure is sought for the biological product;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the biological product and reference product utilize the same mechanism or mechanisms of action for the condition or conditions of use prescribed, recommended, or suggested in the proposed labeling, but only to the extent the mechanism or mechanisms of action are known for the reference product;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Evaluation by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon review of an application (or a supplement to an application) submitted under this subsection, the Secretary shall license the biological product under this subsection if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary determines that the information submitted in the application (or the supplement) is sufficient to show that the biological product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is biosimilar to the reference product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) meets the standards described in paragraph (4), and therefore is interchangeable with the reference product; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the applicant (or other appropriate person) consents to the inspection of the facility that is the subject of the application, in accordance with subsection (c).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon review of an application submitted under this subsection or any supplement to such application, the Secretary shall determine the biological product to be interchangeable with the reference product if the Secretary determines that the information submitted in the application (or a supplement to such application) is sufficient to show that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the biological product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is biosimilar to the reference product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) can be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for a biological product that is administered more than once to an individual, the risk in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the biological product and the reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) General rules</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) One reference product per application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A biological product, in an application submitted under this subsection, may not be evaluated against more than 1 reference product.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Exclusivity for first interchangeable biological product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon review of an application submitted under this subsection relying on the same reference product for which a prior biological product has received a determination of interchangeability for any condition of use, the Secretary shall not make a determination under paragraph (4) that the second or subsequent biological product is interchangeable for any condition of use until the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 1 year after the first commercial marketing of the first interchangeable biosimilar biological product to be approved as interchangeable for that reference product;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 18 months after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a final court decision on all patents in suit in an action instituted under subsection (<em>l</em>)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first approved interchangeable biosimilar biological product; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:358 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the dismissal with or without prejudice of an action instituted under subsection (<em>l</em>)(6) against the applicant that submitted the application for the first approved interchangeable biosimilar biological product; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 18 months after approval of the first interchangeable biosimilar biological product if the applicant that submitted such application has not been sued under subsection (<em>l</em>)(6).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;final court decision&rdquo; means a final decision of a court from which no appeal (other than a petition to the United States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari) has been or can be taken.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall not apply to a license for or approval of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a supplement for the biological product that is the reference product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a subsequent application filed by the same sponsor or manufacturer of the biological product that is the reference product (or a licensor, predecessor in interest, or other related entity) for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a change (not including a modification to the structure of the biological product) that results in a new indication, route of administration, dosing schedule, dosage form, delivery system, delivery device, or strength; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) a modification to the structure of the biological product that does not result in a change in safety, purity, or potency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Guidance documents</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may, after opportunity for public comment, issue guidance in accordance, except as provided in subparagraph (B)(i), with section 701(h) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 371(h)] with respect to the licensure of a biological product under this subsection.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Certain product classes</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Guidance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may indicate in a guidance document that the science and experience, as of the date of such guidance, with respect to a product or product class (not including any recombinant protein) does not allow approval of an application for a license as provided under this subsection for such product or product class.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Modification or reversal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may issue a subsequent guidance document under subparagraph (A) to modify or reverse a guidance document under clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) No effect on ability to deny license</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Clause (i) shall not be construed to require the Secretary to approve a product with respect to which the Secretary has not indicated in a guidance document that the science and experience, as described in clause (i), does not allow approval of such an application.</p>
