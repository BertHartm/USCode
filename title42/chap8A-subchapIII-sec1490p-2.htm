<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will remain available as provided in paragraph (2), according to such binding commitments as the Secretary may require, for the period of the original term of the loan guaranteed, unless the housing is acquired by foreclosure (or instrument in lieu of foreclosure) or the Secretary waives the applicability of such requirement for the loan only after determining, based on objective information, that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirement</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) meets the qualifications, and has been approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, to make loans for multifamily housing that are to be insured under the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.];</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Each loan guaranteed pursuant to this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be made for a period of not less than 25 nor greater than 40 years from the date the loan was made and may provide for amortization of the loan over a period of not to exceed 40 years with a final payment of the balance due at the end of the loan term;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Authority for lenders to issue certificates of guarantee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may authorize certain eligible lenders to determine whether a loan meets the requirements for guarantee under this section and, subject to the availability of authority to enter into guarantees under this section, execute a firm commitment for a guarantee binding upon the Secretary and issue a certificate of guarantee evidencing a guarantee, without review and approval by the Secretary of the specific loan. The Secretary may establish standards for approving eligible lenders for a delegation of authority under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Payment under guarantee</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Notice of default</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the event of default by the borrower on a loan guaranteed under this section, the holder of the guarantee certificate for the loan shall provide written notice of the default to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Foreclosure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After receiving notice under paragraph (1) and providing written notice of action under this paragraph to the Secretary, the holder of the guarantee certificate for the loan may initiate foreclosure proceedings for the loan in a court of competent jurisdiction, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, to obtain possession of the security property. After the court issues a final order authorizing foreclosure on the property, the holder of the certificate shall be entitled to payment by the Secretary under the guarantee (in the amount provided under subsection (b) of this section) upon (A) submission to the Secretary of a claim for payment under the guarantee, and (B) assignment to the Secretary of all the claims of the holder of the guarantee against the borrower or others arising out of the loan transaction or foreclosure proceedings, except claims released with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assignment by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After receiving notice under paragraph (1), the Secretary may accept assignment of the loan if the Secretary determines that the assignment is in the best interests of the United States.

Upon assignment of a loan under this paragraph, the holder of a guarantee certificate for the loan shall be entitled to payment by the Secretary under the guarantee (in the amount provided under subsection (b) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before any payment under a guarantee is made under paragraph (2) or (3), the holder of the guarantee certificate shall exhaust all reasonable possibilities of collection on the loan guaranteed. Upon payment, in whole or in part, to the holder, the note or judgment evidencing the debt shall be assigned to the United States and the holder shall have no further claim against the borrower or the United States. The Secretary shall then take such action to collect as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Violation of guarantee requirements by lenders issuing guarantees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Indemnification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a loan guaranteed by an eligible lender pursuant to delegation of authority under subsection (h) of this section was not originated in accordance with the requirements under this section and the Secretary pays a claim under the guarantee for the loan, the Secretary may require the eligible lender authorized under subsection (h) of this section to issue the guarantee certificate for the loan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to indemnify the Secretary for the loss, if the payment under the guarantee was made within a reasonable period specified by the Secretary; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to indemnify the Secretary for the loss regardless of when payment under the guarantee was made, if the Secretary determines that fraud or misrepresentation was involved in connection with the origination of the loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination of authority to issue guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may cancel a delegation of authority under subsection (h) of this section to an eligible lender if the Secretary determines that the lender has violated the requirements and procedures for guaranteed loans under this section or for other good cause. Any such cancellation shall be made by giving notice to the eligible lender and shall take effect upon receipt of the notice by the mortgagee or at a later date, as the Secretary may provide. A decision by the Secretary to cancel a delegation shall be final and conclusive and shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Refinancing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any loan guaranteed under this section may be refinanced and extended in accordance with terms and conditions that the Secretary shall prescribe, but in no event for an additional amount or term that exceeds the limitations under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Geographical targeting</h4>

The Secretary shall require the independent entity conducting the study to submit a report to the Secretary and to the Congress describing the results of the study not later than the expiration of the 90-day period beginning on March 28, 1996.</p>
