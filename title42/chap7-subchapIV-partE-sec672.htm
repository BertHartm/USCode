<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Voluntary placement&rdquo; and &ldquo;voluntary placement agreement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this part and part B of this subchapter, (1) the term &ldquo;voluntary placement&rdquo; means an out-of-home placement of a minor, by or with participation of a State agency, after <!-- PDFPage:1934 -->the parents or guardians of the minor have requested the assistance of the agency and signed a voluntary placement agreement; and (2) the term &ldquo;voluntary placement agreement&rdquo; means a written agreement, binding on the parties to the agreement, between the State agency, any other agency acting on its behalf, and the parents or guardians of a minor child which specifies, at a minimum, the legal status of the child and the rights and obligations of the parents or guardians, the child, and the agency while the child is in placement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the placement of a minor child in foster care occurred pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement entered into by the parents or guardians of such child as provided in subsection (a) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such parents or guardians request (in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe) that the child be returned to their home or to the home of a relative,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the voluntary placement agreement shall be deemed to be revoked unless the State agency opposes such request and obtains a judicial determination, by a court of competent jurisdiction, that the return of the child to such home would be contrary to the child's best interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Aid for dependent children; assistance for minor children in needy families</h4>

For purposes of division A&nbsp;<sup><a href="#672_1_target" name="672_1">1</a></sup> of subchapter XX of this chapter, any child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are made under this section is deemed to be a minor child in a needy family under a State program funded under part A of this subchapter and is deemed to be a recipient of assistance under such part.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Administrative costs associated with otherwise eligible children not in licensed foster care settings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Expenditures by a State that would be considered administrative expenditures for purposes of section 674(a)(3) of this title if made with respect to a child who was residing in a foster family home or child-care institution shall be so considered with respect to a child not residing in such a home or institution&mdash;</p>
