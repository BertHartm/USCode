<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this section, the Federal Government shall acquire space transportation services from United States commercial providers whenever such services are required in the course of its activities. To the maximum extent practicable, the Federal Government shall plan missions to accommodate the space transportation services capabilities of United States commercial providers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Government shall not be required to acquire space transportation services under subsection (a) of this section if, on a case-by-case basis, the Administrator or, in the case of a national security issue, the Secretary of the Air Force, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a payload requires the unique capabilities of the Space Shuttle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cost effective space transportation services that meet specific mission requirements would not be reasonably available from United States commercial providers when required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers poses an unacceptable risk of loss of a unique scientific opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers is inconsistent with national security objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers is inconsistent with international agreements for international collaborative efforts relating to science and technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) it is more cost effective to transport a payload in conjunction with a test or demonstration of a space transportation vehicle owned by the Federal Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a payload can make use of the available cargo space on a Space Shuttle mission as a secondary payload, and such payload is consistent with the requirements of research, development, demonstration, scientific, commercial, and educational programs authorized by the Administrator.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this section shall prevent the Administrator from planning or negotiating agreements with foreign entities for the launch of Federal Government payloads for international collaborative efforts relating to science and technology.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Delayed effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (a) of this section shall not apply to space transportation services and space transportation vehicles acquired or owned by the Federal Government before October 28, 1998, or with respect to which a contract for such acquisition or ownership has been entered into before October 28, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Historical purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not be construed to prohibit the Federal Government from acquiring, owning, or maintaining space transportation vehicles solely for historical display purposes.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy and preparation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall prepare for an orderly transition from the Federal operation, or Federal management of contracted operation, of space transportation systems to the Federal purchase of commercial space transportation services for all nonemergency space transportation requirements for transportation to and from Earth orbit, including human, cargo, and mixed payloads. In those preparations, the Administrator shall take into account the need for short-term economies, as well as the goal of restoring the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's research focus and its mandate to promote the fullest possible commercial use of space. As part of those preparations, the Administrator shall plan for the potential privatization of the Space Shuttle program. Such plan shall keep safety and cost effectiveness as high priorities. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from studying, designing, developing, or funding upgrades or modifications essential to the safe and economical operation of the Space Shuttle fleet.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Feasibility study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall conduct a study of the feasibility of implementing the recommendation of the Independent Shuttle Management Review Team that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration transition toward the privatization of the Space Shuttle. The study shall identify, discuss, and, where possible, present options for resolving, the major policy and legal issues that must be addressed before the Space Shuttle is privatized, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether the Federal Government or the Space Shuttle contractor should own the Space Shuttle orbiters and ground facilities;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6366 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether the Federal Government should indemnify the contractor for any third party liability arising from Space Shuttle operations, and, if so, under what terms and conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether payloads other than National Aeronautics and Space Administration payloads should be allowed to be launched on the Space Shuttle, how missions will be prioritized, and who will decide which mission flies and when;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether commercial payloads should be allowed to be launched on the Space Shuttle and whether any classes of payloads should be made ineligible for launch consideration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whether National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other Federal Government payloads should have priority over non-Federal payloads in the Space Shuttle launch assignments, and what policies should be developed to prioritize among payloads generally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) whether the public interest requires that certain Space Shuttle functions continue to be performed by the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) how much cost savings, if any, will be generated by privatization of the Space Shuttle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 60 days after October 28, 1998, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall complete the study required under subsection (b) of this section and shall submit a report on the study to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorized Federal uses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A missile described in subsection (c) of this section may be converted for use as a space transportation vehicle by the Federal Government if, except as provided in paragraph (2) and at least 30 days before such conversion, the agency seeking to use the missile as a space transportation vehicle transmits to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives, and to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, a certification that the use of such missile&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) would result in cost savings to the Federal Government when compared to the cost of acquiring space transportation services from United States commercial providers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) meets all mission requirements of the agency, including performance, schedule, and risk requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is consistent with international obligations of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) is approved by the Secretary of Defense or his designee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Missiles referred to</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The missiles referred to in this section are missiles owned by the United States that&mdash;</p>
