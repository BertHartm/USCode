<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it meets the requirements of paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (5) of section 6943(a) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it contains provision for revision of such plan, after notice and public hearing, whenever the Administrator, by regulation, determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that revised regulations respecting minimum requirements have been promulgated under paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (5) of section 6943(a) of this title with which the State plan is not in compliance;</p>

Such withdrawal of approval shall cease to be effective upon the Administrator's determination that such complies with such minimum requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility of States for Federal financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall approve a State application for financial assistance under this <!-- PDFPage:5378 -->subchapter, and make grants to such State, if such State and local and regional authorities within such State have complied with the requirements of section 6946 of this title within the period required under such section and if such State has a State plan which has been approved by the Administrator under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall approve a State application for financial assistance under this subchapter, and make grants to such State, for fiscal years 1978 and 1979 if the Administrator determines that the State plan continues to be eligible for approval under subsection (a) of this section and is being implemented by the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon withdrawal of approval of a State plan under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall withhold Federal financial and technical assistance under this subchapter (other than such technical assistance as may be necessary to assist in obtaining the reinstatement of approval) until such time as such approval is reinstated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Existing activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall be construed to prevent or affect any activities respecting solid waste planning or management which are carried out by State, regional, or local authorities unless such activities are inconsistent with a State plan approved by the Administrator under this subchapter.</p>
