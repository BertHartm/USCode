<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Awarding of contracts in areas</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall conduct a competition among individuals and entities supplying items and services described in subsection (c) of this section for each competitive acquisition area established under a demonstration project implemented under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expansion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines from the evaluations under paragraph (1) that there is clear evidence that any demonstration project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) results in a decrease in Federal expenditures under this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does not reduce program access, diversity of product selection, and quality under this subchapter,</p>
