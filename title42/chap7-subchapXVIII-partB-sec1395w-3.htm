<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Implementation of programs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish and implement programs under which competitive acquisition areas are established throughout the United States for contract award purposes for the furnishing under this part of competitively priced items and services (described in paragraph (2)) for which payment is made under this part. Such areas may differ for different items and services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Phased-in implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The programs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be phased in among competitive acquisition areas in a manner consistent with subparagraph (D) so that the competition under the programs occurs in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 10 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in 2007;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) an additional 70 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in 2011; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) additional areas after 2011 (or, in the case of national mail order for items and services, after 2010); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may be phased in first among the highest cost and highest volume items and services or those items and services that the Secretary determines have the largest savings potential.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the Secretary shall conduct the competition for such round in a manner so that it occurs in 2009 with respect to the same items and services and the same areas, except as provided in subclauses (III) and (IV);</p>
