Such areas may differ for different items and services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Phased-in implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The programs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall be phased in among competitive acquisition areas in a manner so that the competition under the programs occurs in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 10 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in 2007;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 80 of the largest metropolitan statistical areas in 2009; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) additional areas after 2009; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may be phased in first among the highest cost and highest volume items and services or those items and services that the Secretary determines have the largest savings potential.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Waiver of certain provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In carrying out the programs, the Secretary may waive such provisions of the Federal Acquisition Regulation as are necessary for the efficient implementation of this section, other than provisions relating to confidentiality of information and such other provisions as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for certain rented items of durable medical equipment and oxygen</h4>
