<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Application of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A requirement under this chapter that applies to an entity receiving assistance under this section (other than a requirement limited to an entity receiving assistance under subsection (a)) shall be considered to apply to a Federal agency that enters into an interagency agreement under this subsection, even though no Federal agency may receive financial assistance under such an agreement.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Requirements for grant recipients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In awarding a fixed-amount grant under this subsection, the Corporation&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to report on the program's performance on standardized measures and performance levels established by the Corporation;</p>
