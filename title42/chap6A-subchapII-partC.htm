<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) The choice by an eligible patient of the option under clause (i) of subparagraph (A) may at any time be revoked by the patient, and the patient may instead choose the option under clause (ii) of such subparagraph. The choice by an eligible patient of the option under such clause (ii) is irrevocable.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(C) Payments under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be made on a monthly basis, and shall be pro rated as applicable. In 1999 and each subsequent year, the monthly amount of such payments shall be increased by a percentage equal to any percentage increase taking effect under section 215(i) of the Social Security Act [section 415(i) of this title] (relating to a cost-of-living increase) for benefits under title II of such Act [section 401 et seq. of this title] (relating to Federal old-age, survivors, and disability insurance benefits). Any such percentage increase in monthly payments under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall take effect in the same month as the percentage increase under such section 215(i) takes effect.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(D) With respect to the provision of outpatient and inpatient medical care for Hansen's disease and related complications to an eligible patient:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(i) The choice the patient makes under subparagraph (A) does not affect the responsibility of the Secretary for providing to the patient such care at or through the Center.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) If the patient chooses the option under subparagraph (A)(ii) and receives inpatient care at or through the Center, the Secretary may reduce the amount of payments under such subparagraph, except to the extent that reimbursement for the expenses of such care is available to the provider of the care through the program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [section 1395 et seq. of this title] or the program under title XIX of such Act [section 1396 et seq. of this title]. Any such reduction shall be made on the basis of the number of days for which the patient received the inpatient care.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Secretary shall provide to each eligible patient such information and time as may be necessary for the patient to make an informed decision regarding the options under paragraph (5)(A).</p>
