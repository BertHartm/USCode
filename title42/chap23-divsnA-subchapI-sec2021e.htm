<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the seven-year period beginning January 1, 1986 and ending December 31, 1992, subject to the provisions of subsections (b) through (g) of this section, each State in which there is located a regional disposal facility referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) of this section shall make disposal capacity available for low-level radioactive waste generated by pressurized water and boiling water commercial nuclear power reactors in accordance with the allocations established in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other sources of low-level radioactive waste</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the seven-year period beginning January 1, 1986 and ending December 31, 1992, subject to the provisions of subsections (b) through (g) of this section, each State in which there is located a regional disposal facility referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) of this section shall make disposal capacity available for low-level radioactive waste generated by any source not referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Allocation of disposal capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) During the seven-year period beginning January 1, 1986 and ending December 31, 1992, low-level radioactive waste generated within a sited compact region shall be accorded priority under this section in the allocation of available disposal capacity at a regional disposal facility referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) of this section and located in the sited compact region in which such waste is generated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any State in which a regional disposal facility referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) of this section is located may, subject to the provisions of its compact, prohibit the disposal at such facility of low-level radioactive waste generated outside of the compact region if the disposal of such waste in any given calendar year, together with all other low-level radioactive waste disposed of at such facility within that same calendar year, would result in that facility disposing of a total annual volume of low-level radioactive waste in excess of 100 per centum of the average annual volume for such facility designated in subsection (b) of this section: <em>Provided, however</em>, That in the event that all three States in which regional disposal facilities referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) of this section act to prohibit the disposal of low-level radioactive waste pursuant to this subparagraph, each such State shall, in accordance with any applicable procedures of its compact, permit, as necessary, the disposal of additional quantities of such waste in increments of 10 per centum of the average annual volume for each such facility designated in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Nothing in this paragraph shall require any disposal facility or State referred to in paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (b) of this section to accept for disposal low-level radioactive waste in excess of the total amounts designated in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Cessation of operation of low-level radioactive waste disposal facility</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Method of calculation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of calculating the aggregate amount of disposal capacity available to a commercial nuclear power reactor under this subsection, the number of months shall be computed beginning with the first month of the applicable period, or the sixteenth month after receipt of a full power operating license, whichever occurs later.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Unused allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any unused allocation under paragraph (1) received by a reactor during the transition period or the licensing period may be used at any time after such reactor receives its full power license or after the beginning of the pertinent period, whichever is later, but not in any event after December 31, 1992, or after commencement of operation of a regional disposal facility in the compact region or State in which such reactor is located, whichever occurs first.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Transferability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any commercial nuclear power reactor in a State or compact region that is in compliance with the requirements of subsection (e) of this section may assign any disposal capacity allocated to it under this subsection to any other person in each State or compact region. Such assignment may be for valuable consideration and shall be in writing, copies of which shall be filed at the affected compact commissions and States, along with the assignor's unconditional written waiver of the disposal capacity being assigned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Unusual volumes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary may, upon petition by the owner or operator of any commercial nuclear power reactor, allocate to such reactor disposal capacity in excess of the amount calculated under paragraph (1) if the Secretary finds and states in writing his reasons for so finding that making additional capacity available for such reactor through this paragraph is required to permit unusual or unexpected operating, maintenance, repair or safety activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary may not make allocations pursuant to subparagraph (A) that would result in the acceptance for disposal of more than 800,000 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste or would result in the total of the allocations made pursuant to this subsection exceeding 11,900,000 cubic feet over the entire seven-year interim access period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the seven-year interim access period referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the disposal facilities referred to in subsection (b) of this section shall not be required to accept more than 11,900,000 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste generated by commercial nuclear power reactors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of surcharge funds for milestone incentives; consequences of failure to meet disposal deadline</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Surcharges</h4>
