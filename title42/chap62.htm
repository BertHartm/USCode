<p class="statutory-body">The Office is authorized to make grants to a general local government, or a combination of general local governments, that serve a population of fifty thousand or more, for up to 75 per centum (or, with respect to fiscal years commencing after the expiration of three years following the effective date of the grant provisions of this chapter, for up to 50 per centum) of the costs of developing and carrying out programs or projects, on the certification of the mayor(s), or chief executive officer(s), of the general local government or combination of local governments that the programs or projects are consistent with the applicable principles set forth in clauses (1)&ndash;(6) of the third paragraph of section 4701 of this title, to strengthen the personnel administration of such governments. Such a grant may not be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if, at the time of submission of an application, the State concerned has an approved plan which, with the agreement of the particular local government concerned, provides for strengthening one or more aspects of personnel administration in that local government, unless the local government concerned has problems which are not met by the previously approved plan and for which, with the agreement of the State government concerned with respect to those aspects of personnel administration covered in the approved plan, it is submitting an application; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after the State concerned has a statewide plan which has been developed by an appropriate State agency designated or established pursuant to State law which provides such agency with adequate authority, administrative organization, and staffing to develop and administer such a statewide plan, and to provide technical assistance and other appropriate support in carrying out the local components of the plan, and which provides procedures insuring adequate involvement of officials of affected local governments in the development and administration of such a statewide plan, unless the local government concerned has special, unique, or urgent problems which are not met by the approved statewide plan and for which it submits an application for funds to be distributed under section 4766(a) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Upon the request of a Governor or chief executive authority, a grant to a general local government or combination of such governments in that State may not be made during a period not to exceed ninety days commencing with the date provided in section 4772 of this title, or the date on which official regulations for this chapter are promulgated, whichever date is later: <em>Provided</em>, That the request of the Governor or chief executive authority indicates that he is developing a plan under (1) above, or during a period not to exceed one hundred and eighty days commencing with the date provided in section 4772 of this title, or the date on which official regulations for this chapter are promulgated, whichever date is later, provided the request of the Governor or chief executive authority indicates that he is developing a statewide plan under (2) above.</p>

Such a grant may cover the costs of developing the program or project covered by the application. The Office may make grants to general local governments, or combinations of such governments, that serve a population of less than fifty thousand, if it finds that such grants will help meet essential needs in programs or projects of national interest and will assist general local governments experiencing special problems in personnel administration related to such programs or projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Gubernatorial review of application; disapproval explanation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An application to be submitted to the Office under subsection (b) of this section shall first be submitted by the general local government or combination of such governments to the Governor for review, comments, and recommendations.

Comments and recommendations (if any) made as a result of the review, and a statement by the general local government or combination of such governments that it has considered the comments and recommendations of the Governor shall accompany the application to the Office.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4766. Distribution of grants</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State and local government allocations; equitable distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Office shall allocate 20 per centum of the total amount available for grants under this chapter in such manner as will most nearly provide an equitable distribution of the grants among States and between State and local governments, taking into consideration such factors as the size of the population, number of employees affected, the urgency of the programs or projects, the need for funds to carry out the purposes of this chapter, and the potential of the governmental jurisdictions concerned to use the funds most effectively.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Weighted formula; minimum allocation; reallocation; &ldquo;State&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Office shall allocate 80 per centum of the total amount available for grants under this chapter among the States on a weighted formula taking into consideration such factors as the size of population and the number of State and local government employees affected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount allocated for each State under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall be further allocated by the Office to meet the needs of both the State government and the local governments within the State on a weighted formula taking into consideration such factors as the number of State and local government employees and the amount of State and local government expenditures. The Office shall determine the categories of employees and expenditures to be included or excluded, as the case may be, in the number of employees and amount of expenditures. The minimum allocation for meeting needs of local governments in each State (other than the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands) shall be 50 per centum of the amount allocated for the State under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of any allocation under paragraph (2) of this subsection which the Office determines, on the basis of information available to it, will not be used to meet needs for which allocated shall be available for use to meet the needs of the State government or local governments in that State, as the case may be, on such date or dates as the Office may fix.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The amount allocated for any State under paragraph (1) of this subsection which the Office determines, on the basis of information available to it, will not be used shall be available for reallocation by the Office from time to time, on such date or dates as it may fix, among other States with respect to which such a determination has not been made, in accordance with the formula set forth in paragraph (1) of this subsection, but with such amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Office estimates said State needs and will be able to use; and the total of such reductions shall be similarly reallocated among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purposes of this subsection, &ldquo;State&rdquo; means the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, and the Virgin Islands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, the total of the payments from the appropriations for any fiscal year under this chapter made with respect to programs or projects in any one State may not exceed an amount equal to 121/2 per centum of such appropriation.</p>
