<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;280, &sect;2, Nov. 6, 2002, 116 Stat. 1988, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Rare diseases and disorders are those which affect small patient populations, typically populations smaller than 200,000 individuals in the United States. Such diseases and conditions include Huntington's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (Lou Gehrig's disease), Tourette syndrome, Crohn's disease, cystic fibrosis, cystinosis, and Duchenne muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) For many years, the 25,000,000 Americans suffering from the over 6,000 rare diseases and disorders were denied access to effective medicines because prescription drug manufacturers could rarely make a profit from marketing drugs for such small groups of patients. The prescription drug industry did not adequately fund research into such treatments. Despite the urgent health need for these medicines, they came to be known as &lsquo;orphan drugs&rsquo; because no companies would commercialize them.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:461 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) During the 1970s, an organization called the National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) was founded to provide services and to lobby on behalf of patients with rare diseases and disorders. NORD was instrumental in pressing Congress for legislation to encourage the development of orphan drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Orphan Drug Act [Pub. L. 97&ndash;414, see Short Title of 1983 Amendments note set out under section 301 of Title 21, Food and Drugs] created financial incentives for the research and production of such orphan drugs. New Federal programs at the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration encouraged clinical research and commercial product development for products that target rare diseases. An Orphan Products Board was established to promote the development of drugs and devices for rare diseases or disorders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Before 1983, some 38 orphan drugs had been developed. Since the enactment of the Orphan Drug Act [Jan. 4, 1983], more than 220 new orphan drugs have been approved and marketed in the United States and more than 800 additional drugs are in the research pipeline.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Despite the tremendous success of the Orphan Drug Act, rare diseases and disorders deserve greater emphasis in the national biomedical research enterprise. The Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health was created in 1993, but lacks a statutory authorization.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The National Institutes of Health has received a substantial increase in research funding from Congress for the purpose of expanding the national investment of the United States in behavioral and biomedical research.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Notwithstanding such increases, funding for rare diseases and disorders at the National Institutes of Health has not increased appreciably.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) To redress this oversight, the Department of Health and Human Services has proposed the establishment of a network of regional centers of excellence for research on rare diseases.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Short Title of 2002 Amendments note set out under section 201 of this title] are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) amend the Public Health Service Act [this chapter] to establish an Office of Rare Diseases at the National Institutes of Health; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) increase the national investment in the development of diagnostics and treatments for patients with rare diseases and disorders.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;505, title II, &sect;202, Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2325, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Clinical research is critical to the advancement of scientific knowledge and to the development of cures and improved treatment for disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Tremendous advances in biology are opening doors to new insights into human physiology, pathophysiology and disease, creating extraordinary opportunities for clinical research.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Clinical research includes translational research which is an integral part of the research process leading to general human applications. It is the bridge between the laboratory and new methods of diagnosis, treatment, and prevention and is thus essential to progress against cancer and other diseases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States will spend more than $1,200,000,000,000 on health care in 1999, but the Federal budget for health research at the National Institutes of Health was $15,600,000,000 only 1 percent of that total.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Studies at the Institute of Medicine, the National Research Council, and the National Academy of Sciences have all addressed the current problems in clinical research.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Director of the National Institutes of Health has recognized the current problems in clinical research and appointed a special panel, which recommended expanded support for existing National Institutes of Health clinical research programs and the creation of new initiatives to recruit and retain clinical investigators.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The current level of training and support for health professionals in clinical research is fragmented, undervalued, and underfunded.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Young investigators are not only apprentices for future positions but a crucial source of energy, enthusiasm, and ideas in the day-to-day research that constitutes the scientific enterprise. Serious questions about the future of life-science research are raised by the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) The number of young investigators applying for grants dropped by 54 percent between 1985 and 1993.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The number of physicians applying for first-time National Institutes of Health research project grants fell from 1226 in 1994 to 963 in 1998, a 21 percent reduction.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Newly independent life-scientists are expected to raise funds to support their new research programs and a substantial proportion of their own salaries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) The following have been cited as reasons for the decline in the number of active clinical researchers, and those choosing this career path:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) A medical school graduate incurs an average debt of $85,619, as reported in the Medical School Graduation Questionnaire by the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC).</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The prolonged period of clinical training required increases the accumulated debt burden.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) The decreasing number of mentors and role models.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) The perceived instability of funding from the National Institutes of Health and other Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) The almost complete absence of clinical research training in the curriculum of training grant awardees.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) Academic Medical Centers are experiencing difficulties in maintaining a proper environment for research in a highly competitive health care marketplace, which are compounded by the decreased willingness of third party payers to cover health care costs for patients engaged in research studies and research procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) In 1960, general clinical research centers were established under the Office of the Director of the National Institutes of Health with an initial appropriation of $3,000,000.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Appropriations for general clinical research centers in fiscal year 1999 equaled $200,500,000.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Since the late 1960s, spending for general clinical research centers has declined from approximately 3 percent to 1 percent of the National Institutes of Health budget.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) In fiscal year 1999, there were 77 general clinical research centers in operation, supplying patients in the areas in which such centers operate with access to the most modern clinical research and clinical research facilities and technologies.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this title [see Short Title of 2000 Amendments note set out under section 201 of this title] to provide additional support for and to expand clinical research programs.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Oversight by GAO</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;505, title II, &sect;207, Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2330, provided that, not later than 18 months after Nov. 13, 2000, the Comptroller General was to submit to Congress a report describing the extent to which the National Institutes of Health had complied with the amendments made by title II of Pub.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) lupus is a serious, complex, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of particular concern to women;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) lupus affects women nine times more often than men;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) there are three main types of lupus: systemic lupus, a serious form of the disease that affects many parts of the body; discoid lupus, a form of the disease that affects mainly the skin; and drug-induced lupus caused by certain medications;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) lupus can be fatal if not detected and treated early;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the disease can simultaneously affect various areas of the body, such as the skin, joints, kidneys, and brain, and can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of lupus are similar to those of many other diseases;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) lupus disproportionately affects African-American women, as the prevalence of the disease among such women is three times the prevalence among white women, and an estimated 1 in 250 African-American women between the ages of 15 and 65 develops the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) it has been estimated that between 1,400,000 and 2,000,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and that many more have undiagnosed cases;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) current treatments for the disease can be effective, but may lead to damaging side effects;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) many victims of the disease suffer debilitating pain and fatigue, making it difficult to maintain employment and lead normal lives; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) in fiscal year 1996, the amount allocated by the National Institutes of Health for research on lupus was $33,000,000, which is less than one-half of 1 percent of the budget for such Institutes.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Identification of tests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to each Federal agency carrying out a program that requires or recommends acute or chronic toxicological testing, such agency shall, not later than 180 days after receiving an ICCVAM test recommendation, identify and forward to the ICCVAM any relevant test method specified in a regulation or industry-wide guideline which specifically, or in practice requires, recommends, or encourages the use of an animal acute or chronic toxicological test method for which the ICCVAM test recommendation may be added or substituted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Alternatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) of this section shall promote and encourage the development and use of alternatives to animal test methods (including batteries of tests and test screens), where <!-- PDFPage:520 -->appropriate, for the purpose of complying with Federal statutes, regulations, guidelines, or recommendations (in each instance, and for each chemical class) if such test methods are found to be effective for generating data, in an amount and of a scientific value that is at least equivalent to the data generated from existing tests, for hazard identification, dose-response assessment, or risk assessment purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Test method validation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) of this section shall ensure that any new or revised acute or chronic toxicity test method, including animal test methods and alternatives, is determined to be valid for its proposed use prior to requiring, recommending, or encouraging the application of such test method.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 180 days after receipt of an ICCVAM test recommendation, a Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) of this section shall review such recommendation and notify the ICCVAM in writing of its findings.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Recommendation adoption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) of this section, or its specific regulatory unit or units, shall adopt the ICCVAM test recommendation unless such Federal agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ICCVAM test recommendation is not adequate in terms of biological relevance for the regulatory goal authorized by that agency, or mandated by Congress;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the ICCVAM test recommendation does not generate data, in an amount and of a scientific value that is at least equivalent to the data generated prior to such recommendation, for the appropriate hazard identification, dose-response assessment, or risk assessment purposes as the current test method recommended or required by that agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the agency does not employ, recommend, or require testing for that class of chemical or for the recommended test endpoint; or</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;580, &sect;2, Dec. 29, 2000, 114 Stat. 3088, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Basic research in imaging, bioengineering, computer science, informatics, and related fields is critical to improving health care but is fundamentally different from the research in molecular biology on which the current national research institutes at the National Institutes of Health (&lsquo;NIH&rsquo;) are based. To ensure the development of new techniques and technologies for the 21st century, these disciplines therefore require an identity and research home at <!-- PDFPage:537 -->the NIH that is independent of the existing institute structure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Advances based on medical research promise new, more effective treatments for a wide variety of diseases, but the development of new, noninvasive imaging techniques for earlier detection and diagnosis of disease is essential to take full advantage of such new treatments and to promote the general improvement of health care.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The development of advanced genetic and molecular imaging techniques is necessary to continue the current rapid pace of discovery in molecular biology.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Advances in telemedicine, and teleradiology in particular, are increasingly important in the delivery of high quality, reliable medical care to rural citizens and other underserved populations. To fulfill the promise of telemedicine and related technologies fully, a structure is needed at the NIH to support basic research focused on the acquisition, transmission, processing, and optimal display of images.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A number of Federal departments and agencies support imaging and engineering research with potential medical applications, but a central coordinating body, preferably housed at the NIH, is needed to coordinate these disparate efforts and facilitate the transfer of technologies with medical applications.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Several breakthrough imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (&lsquo;MRI&rsquo;) and computed tomography (&lsquo;CT&rsquo;), have been developed primarily abroad, in large part because of the absence of a home at the NIH for basic research in imaging and related fields. The establishment of a central focus for imaging and bioengineering research at the NIH would promote both scientific advance and United States economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) At a time when a consensus exists to add significant resources to the NIH in coming years, it is appropriate to modernize the structure of the NIH to ensure that research dollars are expended more effectively and efficiently and that the fields of medical science that have contributed the most to the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease in recent years receive appropriate emphasis.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The establishment of a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the NIH would accelerate the development of new technologies with clinical and research applications, improve coordination and efficiency at the NIH and throughout the Federal Government, reduce duplication and waste, lay the foundation for a new medical information age, promote economic development, and provide a structure to train the young researchers who will make the pathbreaking discoveries of the next century.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Establishment of Institute and Advisory Council</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;580, &sect;3(b)&ndash;(d), Dec. 29, 2000, 114 Stat. 3091, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Existing Resources</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In providing for the establishment of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering pursuant to the amendment made by subsection (a) [enacting this subpart], the Director of the National Institutes of Health (referred to in this subsection as &lsquo;NIH&rsquo;)&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;525, &sect;2, Nov. 22, 2000, 114 Stat. 2495, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Despite notable progress in the overall health of the Nation, there are continuing disparities in the burden of illness and death experienced by African Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaska Natives, and Asian Pacific Islanders, compared to the United States population as a whole.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The largest numbers of the medically underserved are white individuals, and many of them have the same health care access problems as do members of minority groups. Nearly 20,000,000 white individuals live below the poverty line with many living in nonmetropolitan, rural areas such as Appalachia, where the high percentage of counties designated as health professional shortage areas (47 percent) and the high rate of poverty contribute to disparity outcomes. However, there is a higher proportion of racial and ethnic minorities in the United States represented among the medically underserved.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) There is a national need for minority scientists in the fields of biomedical, clinical, behavioral, and health services research. Ninety percent of minority physicians educated at Historically Black Medical Colleges live and serve in minority communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Demographic trends inspire concern about the Nation's ability to meet its future scientific, technological, and engineering workforce needs. Historically, non-Hispanic white males have made up the majority of the United States scientific, technological, and engineering workers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Hispanic and Black population will increase significantly in the next 50 years. The scientific, technological, and engineering workforce may decrease if participation by underrepresented minorities remains the same.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Increasing rates of Black and Hispanic workers can help ensure a strong scientific, technological, and engineering workforce.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Individuals such as underrepresented minorities and women in the scientific, technological, and engineering workforce enable society to address its diverse needs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) If there had not been a substantial increase in the number of science and engineering degrees awarded to women and underrepresented minorities over the past few decades, the United States would be facing even greater shortages in scientific, technological, and engineering workers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) In order to effectively promote a diverse and strong 21st century scientific, technological, and engineering workforce, Federal agencies should expand or add programs that effectively overcome barriers such as educational transition from one level to the next and student requirements for financial resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Federal agencies should work in concert with the private nonprofit sector to emphasize the recruitment and retention of qualified individuals from ethnic and gender groups that are currently underrepresented in the scientific, technological, and engineering workforce.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Behavioral and social sciences research has increased awareness and understanding of factors associated with health care utilization and access, patient attitudes toward health services, and risk and protective behaviors that affect health and illness. These factors have the potential to then be modified to help close the health disparities gap among ethnic minority populations. In addition, there is a shortage of minority behavioral science researchers and behavioral health care professionals. According to the National Science Foundation, only 15.5 percent of behavioral research-oriented psychology doctorate degrees were awarded to minority students in 1997. In addition, only 17.9 percent of practice-oriented psychology doctorate degrees were awarded to ethnic minorities.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Protection of human research subjects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the case of any application submitted to the Secretary for financial assistance to conduct research, the Secretary may not approve or fund any application that is subject to review under section 289(a) of this title by an Institutional Review Board unless the application has undergone review in accordance with such section and has been recommended for approval by a majority of the members of the Board conducting such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of research that is subject to review under procedures established by the Secretary for the protection of human subjects in clinical research conducted by the National Institutes of Health, the Secretary may not authorize the conduct of the research unless the research has, pursuant to such procedures, been recommended for approval.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Peer review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any proposal for the National Institutes of Health to conduct or support research, the Secretary may not approve or fund any proposal that is subject to technical and scientific peer review under section 289a of this title unless the proposal has undergone such review in accordance with such section and has been recommended for approval by a majority of the members of the entity conducting such review, and unless a majority of the voting members of the appropriate advisory council under section 284a of this title, or as applicable, of the advisory council under section 282(k) of this title, has recommended the proposal for approval.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Ethical review of research</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Procedures regarding withholding of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If research has been recommended for approval for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may not withhold funds for the research because of ethical considerations unless&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the majority of such board recommends that the Secretary not withhold funds for the research because of such considerations, but the Secretary finds, on the basis of the report submitted under paragraph (5)(B)(ii), that the recommendation is arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rules of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) may not be construed as prohibiting the Secretary from withholding funds for research on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the inadequacy of the qualifications of the entities that would be involved with the conduct of the research (including the entity that would directly receive the funds from the Secretary), subject to the condition that, with respect to the process of review through which the research was recommended for approval for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, all findings regarding such qualifications made in such process are conclusive; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the priorities established by the Secretary for the allocation of funds among projects of research that have been so recommended.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The limitation established in paragraph (1) regarding the authority to withhold funds because of ethical considerations shall apply without regard to whether the withholding of funds on such basis is characterized as a disapproval, a moratorium, a prohibition, or other characterization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Preliminary matters regarding use of procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If the Secretary makes a determination that an advisory board should be convened for purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall, through a statement published in the Federal Register, announce the intention of the Secretary to convene such a board.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:572 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A statement issued under subparagraph (A) shall include a request that interested individuals submit to the Secretary recommendations specifying the particular individuals who should be appointed to the advisory board involved.

Contrary to the recommendations of a National Institutes of Health advisory panel, on November 2, 1989, the Secretary of Health and Human Services extended the moratorium indefinitely. This moratorium has significantly hampered the development of possible treatments for individuals afflicted with serious diseases and disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, and leukemia.
