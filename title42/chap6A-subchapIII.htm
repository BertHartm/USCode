<p class="statutory-body-1em">The study required in subsection (a) of this section shall be a longitudinal study in which a substantial number of adolescents participate as subjects. With respect to the purpose described in such subsection, the study shall monitor the subjects throughout the period of the study to determine the health status of the subjects and any change in such status over time.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Population-specific analyses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The study required in subsection (a) of this section shall be conducted with respect to the population of adolescents who are female, the population of adolescents who are male, various socioeconomic populations of adolescents, and various racial and ethnic populations of adolescents. The study shall be designed and conducted in a manner sufficient to provide for a valid analysis of whether there are significant differences among such populations in health status and whether and to what extent any such differences are due to factors particular to the populations involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Coordination with Women's Health Initiative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the national study of women being conducted by the Secretary and known as the Women's Health Initiative, the Secretary shall ensure that such study is coordinated with the component of the study required in subsection (a) of this section that concerns adolescent females, including coordination in the design of the 2 studies.</p>
