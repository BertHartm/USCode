<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payment of hospitals for inpatient services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop a model system or systems for the payment of hospitals for inpatient hospital services on a prospective basis which may be applied for reimbursement of hospitals under subchapter XVIII of this chapter or under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall report to the Congress on the development of such system or systems not later than July 31, 1982.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Proposals for legislation relating to reimbursement of providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop, in consultation with the Senate Committee on Finance and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, proposals for legislation which would provide that hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, and, to the extent feasible, other providers, would be reimbursed under subchapter XVIII of this chapter on a prospective basis. The Secretary shall report such proposals to such committees not later than December 31, 1982.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prospective payment methodology for outpatient hospital services</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The system shall provide for appropriate payment rates with respect to such procedures. In establishing such rates, the Secretary shall consider whether a differential payment rate is appropriate for specialty hospitals.</p>
