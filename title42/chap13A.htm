<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) There is hereby authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, and for each succeeding fiscal year, such sums as may be necessary to enable the Secretary of Agriculture, under such rules and regulations as the Secretary may deem in the public interest, to encourage consumption of fluid milk by children in the United States in (A) nonprofit schools of high school grade and under, except as provided in paragraph (2), which do not participate in a meal service program authorized under this chapter or the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], and (B) nonprofit nursery schools, child-care centers, settlement houses, summer camps, and similar nonprofit institutions devoted to the care and training of children, which do not participate in a meal service program authorized under this chapter or the National School Lunch Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The limitation imposed under paragraph (1)(A) for participation of nonprofit schools in the special milk program shall not apply to split-session kindergarten programs conducted in schools in which children do not have access to the meal service program operating in schools the children attend as authorized under this chapter or the National School Lunch Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purposes of this section &ldquo;United States&rdquo; means the fifty States, Guam, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall administer the special milk program provided for by this section to the maximum extent practicable in the same manner as the Secretary administered the special milk program provided for by this chapter during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any school or nonprofit child care institution which does not participate in a meal service <!-- PDFPage:2484 -->program authorized under this chapter or the National School Lunch Act shall receive the special milk program upon its request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Children who qualify for free lunches under guidelines set forth by the Secretary shall, at the option of the school involved (or of the local educational agency involved in the case of a public school) be eligible for free milk upon their request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and for subsequent school years, the minimum rate of reimbursement for a half-pint of milk served in schools and other eligible institutions shall not be less than 5 cents per half-pint served to eligible children, and such minimum rate of reimbursement shall be adjusted on an annual basis each school year to reflect changes in the Producer Price Index for Fresh Processed Milk published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Such adjustment shall be computed to the nearest one-fourth cent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in no event shall the minimum rate of reimbursement exceed the cost to the school or institution of milk served to children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) The State educational agency shall disburse funds paid to the State during any fiscal year for purposes of carrying out the program under this section in accordance with such agreements approved by the Secretary as may be entered into by such State agency and the schools in the State. The agreements described in the preceding sentence shall be permanent agreements that may be amended as necessary. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to limit the ability of the State educational agency to suspend or terminate any such agreement in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Commodity only schools shall not be eligible to participate in the special milk program under this section. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;commodity only schools&rdquo; means schools that do not participate in the school lunch program under the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], but which receive commodities made available by the Secretary for use by such schools in nonprofit lunch programs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby authorized to be appropriated such sums as are necessary to enable the Secretary to carry out a program to assist the States and the Department of Defense through grants-in-aid and other means to initiate, maintain, or expand nonprofit breakfast programs in all schools which make application for assistance and agree to carry out a nonprofit breakfast program in accordance with this chapter and to carry out the provisions of subsection (g) of this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the number of breakfasts served during such fiscal year to children in schools in such States which participate in the school breakfast program under agreements with such State educational agency; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the national average breakfast payment for free breakfasts, for reduced price breakfasts, or for breakfasts served to children not eligible for free or reduced price meals, as appropriate, as prescribed in clause (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The agreements described in clause (i)(I) shall be permanent agreements that may be amended as necessary. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to limit the ability of the State educational agency to suspend or terminate any such agreement in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The national average payment for each free breakfast shall be 57 cents (as adjusted pursuant to section 1759a(a) of this title). The national average payment for each reduced price breakfast shall be one-half of the national average payment for each free breakfast, adjusted to the nearest one-fourth cent, except that in no case shall the difference between the amount of the national average payment for a free breakfast and the national average payment for a reduced price breakfast exceed 30 cents. The national average payment for each breakfast served to a child not eligible for free or reduced price meals shall be 8.25 cents (as adjusted pursuant to section 1759a(a) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) No school which receives breakfast assistance payments under this section may charge a price of more than 30 cents for a reduced price breakfast.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) No breakfast assistance payment may be made under this subsection for any breakfast served by a school unless such breakfast consists of a combination of foods which meet the minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary under subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall make additional payments for breakfasts served to children qualifying for a free or reduced price meal at schools that are in severe need.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The maximum payment for each such free breakfast shall be the higher of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the national average payment established by the Secretary for free breakfasts plus 10 cents, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) 45 cents, which shall be adjusted on an annual basis each July 1 to the nearest one-fourth cent in accordance with changes in the series for food away from home of the Con<!-- PDFPage:2486 -->sumer Price Index published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the Department of Labor for the most recent twelve-month period for which such data are available, except that the initial such adjustment shall be made on January 1, 1978, and shall reflect the change in the series of food away from home during the period November 1, 1976, to October 31, 1977.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The maximum payment for each such reduced price breakfast shall be thirty cents less than the maximum payment for each free breakfast as determined under clause (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall increase by 6 cents the annually adjusted payment for each breakfast served under this chapter and section 1766 of this title. These funds shall be used to assist States, to the extent feasible, in improving the nutritional quality of the breakfasts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, whenever stocks of agricultural commodities are acquired by the Secretary or the Commodity Credit Corporation and are not likely to be sold by the Secretary or the Commodity Credit Corporation or otherwise used in programs of commodity sale or distribution, the Secretary shall make such commodities available to school food authorities and eligible institutions serving breakfasts under this chapter in a quantity equal in value to not less than 3 cents for each breakfast served under this chapter and section 1766 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Expenditures of funds from State and local sources for the maintenance of the breakfast program shall not be diminished as a result of funds or commodities received under paragraph (3) or (4).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Funds apportioned and paid to any State for the purpose of this section shall be disbursed by the State educational agency to schools selected by the State educational agency to assist such schools in operating a breakfast program and for the purpose of subsection (d) of this section. Disbursement to schools shall be made at such rates per meal or on such other basis as the Secretary shall prescribe. In selecting schools for participation, the State educational agency shall, to the extent practicable, give first consideration to those schools drawing attendance from areas in which poor economic conditions exist, to those schools in which a substantial proportion of the children enrolled must travel long distances daily, and to those schools in which there is a special need for improving the nutrition and dietary practices of children of working mothers and children from low-income families. Breakfast assistance disbursements to schools under this section may be made in advance or by way of reimbursement in accordance with procedures prescribed by the Secretary.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The provision of eligibility specified in clause (A) of this paragraph shall terminate effective July 1, 1983, for schools in States where the State legislatures meet annually and shall terminate effective July 1, 1984, for schools in States where the State legislatures meet biennially.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A school, upon the submission of appropriate documentation about the need circumstances in that school and the school's eligibility for additional assistance, shall be entitled to receive 100 percent of the operating costs of the breakfast program, including the costs of obtaining, preparing, and serving food, or the meal reimbursement rate specified in paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section, whichever is less.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nutritional requirements; service free or at reduced price; compliance assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Breakfasts served by schools participating in the school breakfast program under this section shall consist of a combination of foods and shall meet the minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary on the basis of tested nutritional research, except that the minimum nutritional requirements shall be measured by not less than the weekly average of the nutrient content of school breakfasts. Such breakfasts shall be served free or at a reduced price to children in school under the same terms and conditions as are set forth with respect to the service of lunches free or at a reduced price in section 1758 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall provide through State educational agencies technical assistance and training, including technical assistance and training in the preparation of foods high in complex carbohydrates and lower-fat versions of foods commonly used in the school breakfast program established under this section, to schools participating in the school breakfast program to assist the schools in complying with the nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (A) and in providing appropriate meals to children with medically certified special dietary needs. The Secretary shall provide through State educational agencies additional technical assistance to schools that are having difficulty maintaining compliance with the requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) At the option of a local school food authority, a student in a school under the authority <!-- PDFPage:2487 -->that participates in the school breakfast program under this chapter may be allowed to refuse not more than one item of a breakfast that the student does not intend to consume. A refusal of an offered food item shall not affect the full charge to the student for a breakfast meeting the requirements of this section or the amount of payments made under this chapter to a school for the breakfast.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Expansion of program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) As a national nutrition and health policy, it is the purpose and intent of the Congress that the school breakfast program be made available in all schools where it is needed to provide adequate nutrition for children in attendance. The Secretary is hereby directed, in cooperation with State educational agencies, to carry out a program of information in furtherance of this policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In cooperation with State educational agencies, the Secretary shall promote the school breakfast program by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) marketing the program in a manner that expands participation in the program by schools and students; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not later than October 1, 1993, the Secretary shall report to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate concerning the efforts of the Secretary and the States to increase the participation of schools in the program.</p>

In no case shall the grant available to any State under this subsection be less than the amount such State was allocated in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1981, or $100,000, whichever is larger.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall allocate to each State for its administrative costs incurred under the program authorized by section 17 of the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1766] in any fiscal year an amount, based upon funds expended under that program in the second preceding fiscal year, equal to (A) 20 percent of the first $50,000, (B) 10 percent of the next $100,000, (C) 5 percent of the next $250,000, and (D) 21/2 percent of any remaining funds.

The Secretary may adjust any State's allocation to reflect changes in the size of its program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The remaining funds appropriated under this section shall be allocated among the States by the Secretary in amounts the Secretary determines necessary for the improvement in the States of the administration of the programs authorized under the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.] and this chapter, except for section 1786 of this title, including, but not limited to, improved program integrity and the quality of meals served to children.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) After making the allocations under subclause (I), the Secretary shall allocate, for purposes of administrative costs, any remaining amounts among States that demonstrate a need for such amounts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Funds available to States under this subsection and under section 13(k)(1) of the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1761(k)(1)] shall be used for the costs of administration of the programs for which the allocations are made, except that States may transfer up to 10 percent of any of the amounts allocated among such programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Where the Secretary is responsible for the administration of programs under this chapter or the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], the amount of funds that would be allocated to the State agency under this section and under section 13(k)(1) of the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1761(k)(1)] shall be retained by the Secretary for the Secretary's use in the administration of such programs.</p>

In developing such regulations, the Secretary may consider the value of commodities provided to the State under this chapter and under the National School Lunch Act.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9)(A) If the Secretary determines that the administration of any program by a State under this chapter (other than section 1786 of this title) or under the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.), or compliance with a regulation issued pursuant to either this chapter or such Act, is seriously deficient, and the State fails to correct the deficiency within a specified period of time, the Secretary may withhold from the State some or all of the funds allocated to the State under this section or under section 13(k)(1) or 17 of the National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1761(k)(1) or 1766).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) On a subsequent determination by the Secretary that the administration of any program referred to in subparagraph (A), or compliance with the regulations issued to carry out the program, is no longer seriously deficient and is operated in an acceptable manner, the Secretary may allocate some or all of the funds withheld under such subparagraph.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Unused funds; availability for obligation and expenditure, and reallocation to other States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, funds made available to each State under this section shall remain available for obligation and expenditure by that State during the fiscal year immediately following the fiscal year for which such funds were made available.

The Secretary shall take affirmative action to ensure that the program is instituted in areas most in need of supplemental foods. The existence of a commodity supplemental food program under section 4 of the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Act of 1973 shall not preclude the approval of an application from an eligible local agency to participate in the program under this section nor the operation of such program within the same geographic area as that of the commodity supplemental food program, but the Secretary shall issue such regulations as are necessary to prevent dual receipt of benefits under the commodity supplemental food program and the program under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall establish income eligibility standards to be used in conjunction with the nutritional risk criteria in determining eligibility of individuals for participation in the program. Any individual at nutritional risk shall be eligible for the program under this section only if such individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is a member of a family with an income that is less than the maximum income limit prescribed under section 1758(b) of this title for free and reduced price meals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii)(I) receives food stamps under the Food Stamp Act of 1977 [7 U.S.C. 2011 et seq.]; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purpose of determining income eligibility under this section, any State agency may choose to exclude from income any basic allowance for quarters received by military service personnel residing off military installations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a pregnant woman who is otherwise ineligible for participation in the program because the family of the woman is of insufficient size to meet the income eligibility standards of the program, the pregnant woman shall be considered to have satisfied the income eligibility standards if, by increasing the number of individuals in the family of the woman by 1 individual, the income eligibility standards would be met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Persons shall be certified for participation in accordance with general procedures prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A State may consider pregnant women who meet the income eligibility standards to be presumptively eligible to participate in the program and may certify the women for participation immediately, without delaying certification until an evaluation is made concerning nutritional risk. A nutritional risk evaluation of such a woman shall be completed not later than 60 days after the woman is certified for participation. If it is subsequently determined that the woman does not meet nutritional risk criteria, the certification of the woman shall terminate on the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall report biennially to Congress and the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition established under subsection (k) of this section on&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2500 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the income and nutritional risk characteristics of participants in the program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) participation in the program by members of families of migrant farmworkers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such other matters relating to participation in the program as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nutrition education and drug abuse education</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State agency shall ensure that nutrition education and drug abuse education is provided to all pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding participants in the program and to parents or caretakers of infant and child participants in the program. The State agency may also provide nutrition education and drug abuse education to pregnant, postpartum, and breastfeeding women and to parents or caretakers of infants and children enrolled at local agencies operating the program under this section who do not participate in the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall prescribe standards to ensure that adequate nutrition education services and breastfeeding promotion and support are provided. The State agency shall provide training to persons providing nutrition education under this section. Nutrition education and breastfeeding promotion and support shall be evaluated annually by each State agency, and such evaluation shall include the views of participants concerning the effectiveness of the nutrition education and breastfeeding promotion and support they have received.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in any fiscal year that a State agency achieves, through use of acceptable measures, participation that exceeds the participation level estimated for such State agency under paragraph (2)(A)(ii)(I), such State agency may convert amounts allocated for food benefits for such fiscal year for costs of nutrition services and administration to the extent that such conversion is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to cover allowable expenditures in such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to ensure that the State agency maintains the level established for the per participant grant for nutrition services and administration for such fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a State agency increases its participation level through measures that are not in the nutritional interests of participants or not otherwise allowable (such as reducing the quantities of foods provided for reasons not related to nutritional need), the Secretary may refuse to allow the State agency to convert amounts allocated for food benefits to defray costs of nutrition services and administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;acceptable measures&rdquo; includes use of cost containment measures, curtailment of vendor abuse, and breastfeeding promotion activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In each fiscal year, each State agency shall provide, from the amounts allocated to such agency for such year for costs of nutrition services and administration, an amount to each local agency for its costs of nutrition services and administration. The amount to be provided to each local agency under the preceding sentence shall be determined under allocation standards developed by the State agency in cooperation with the several local agencies, taking into account factors deemed appropriate to further proper, efficient, and effective administration of the program, such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) local agency staffing needs;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2506 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) density of population;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) number of individuals served; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) availability of administrative support from other sources.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The State agency may provide in advance to any local agency any amounts for nutrition services and administration deemed necessary for successful commencement or significant expansion of program operations during a reasonable period following approval of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a new cost containment measure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a significant change in an existing cost containment measure.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) No State may receive its allocation under this subsection unless on or before August 30, 1989 (or a subsequent date established by the Secretary for any State) such State has&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) examined the feasibility of implementing cost containment measures with respect to procurement of infant formula, and, where practicable, other foods necessary to carry out the program under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) initiated action to implement such measures unless the State demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that such measures would not lower costs or would interfere with the delivery of formula or foods to participants in the program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Except as provided in subparagraphs (C), (D), and (E)(iii), in carrying out subparagraph (A), any State that provides for the purchase of foods under the program at retail grocery stores shall, with respect to the procurement of infant formula, use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a competitive bidding system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) any other cost containment measure that yields savings equal to or greater than savings generated by a competitive bidding system when such savings are determined by comparing the amounts of savings that would be provided over the full term of contracts offered in response to a single invitation to submit both competitive bids and bids for other cost containment systems for the sale of infant formula.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In determining whether a cost containment measure other than competitive bidding yields equal or greater savings, the State, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, may take into account other cost factors (in addition to rebate levels and procedures for adjusting rebate levels when wholesale price levels rise), such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the number of infants who would not be expected to receive the contract brand of infant formula under a competitive bidding system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the number of cans of infant formula for which no rebate would be provided under another rebate system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) differences in administrative costs relating to the implementation of the various cost containment systems (such as costs of converting a computer system for the purpose of operating a cost containment system and costs of preparing participants for conversion to a new or alternate cost containment system).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of any State that has a contract in effect on November 10, 1989, subparagraph (B) shall not apply to the program operated by such State under this section until the term of such contract, as such term is specified by the contract as in effect on November 10, 1989, expires. In the case of any State that has more than 1 such contract in effect on November 10, 1989, subparagraph (B) shall not apply until the term of the contract with the latest expiration date, as such term is specified by such contract as in effect on November 10, 1989, expires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) The Secretary shall waive the requirement of subparagraph (B) in the case of any State that demonstrates to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) compliance with subparagraph (B) would be inconsistent with efficient or effective operation of the program operated by such State under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the amount by which the savings yielded by an alternative cost containment system would be less than the savings yielded by a competitive bidding system is sufficiently minimal that the difference is not significant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall prescribe criteria under which a waiver may be granted pursuant to clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall provide information on a timely basis to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate on waivers that have been granted under clause (i).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary may waive the requirement of subparagraph (B) in the case of any Indian State agency that has not more than 1,000 participants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) No State may enter into a cost containment contract (in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;original contract&rdquo;) that prescribes conditions that would void, reduce the savings under, or otherwise limit the original contract if the State solicited or secured bids for, or entered into, a subsequent cost containment contract to take effect after the expiration of the original contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) The Secretary shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost-containment contracts to be entered into by infant formula manufacturers and State agencies. The Secretary shall make the offer to State agencies once every 12 months. Each such bid solicitation shall only take place if two or more State agencies request the Secretary to perform the solicitation. For such State agencies, the Secretary shall solicit bids and select the winning bidder for a cost containment contract to be entered into by State agencies and infant formula manufacturers or suppliers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary determines that the number of State agencies making the election in clause (i) so warrants, the Secretary may, in <!-- PDFPage:2507 -->consultation with such State agencies, divide such State agencies into more than one group of such agencies and solicit bids for a contract for each such group. In determining the size of the groups of agencies, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, take into account the need to maximize the number of potential bidders so as to increase competition among infant formula manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) State agencies that elect to authorize the Secretary to perform the bid solicitation and selection process on their behalf and enter into the resulting containment contract shall obtain the rebates or discounts from the manufacturers or suppliers participating in the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In soliciting bids and determining the winning bidder under clause (i), the Secretary shall comply with the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (F).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v)(I) Except as provided in subclause (II), the term of the contract for which bids are to be solicited under this paragraph shall be announced by the Secretary in consultation with the affected State agencies and shall be not less than 2 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) If the law of a State regarding the duration of contracts is inconsistent with subclause (I), the Secretary shall permit a 1-year contract, with the option provided to the State to extend the contract for additional years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) In prescribing specifications for the bids, the Secretary shall ensure that the contracts to be entered into by the State agencies and the infant formula manufacturers or suppliers provide for a constant net price for infant formula products for the full term of the contracts and provide for rebates or discounts for all units of infant formula sold through the program that are produced by the manufacturer awarded the contract and that are for a type of formula product covered under the contract. The contracts shall cover all types of infant formula products normally covered under cost containment contracts entered into by State agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) The Secretary shall also develop procedures for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) rejecting all bids for any joint contract and announcing a resolicitation of infant formula bids where necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) permitting a State agency that has authorized the Secretary to undertake bid solicitation on its behalf under this subparagraph to decline to enter into the joint contract to be negotiated and awarded pursuant to the solicitation if the agency promptly determines after the bids are opened that participation would not be in the best interest of its program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) assuring infant formula manufacturers submitting a bid under this subparagraph that a contract awarded pursuant to the bid will cover State agencies serving no fewer than a number of infants to be specified in the bid solicitation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) The bid solicitation and selection process on behalf of the State agencies shall be conducted in accordance with any procedures the Secretary deems necessary for the effective and efficient administration of the bid solicitation and selection process and consistent with the requirements of this subparagraph. The procedures established by the Secretary shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the bid solicitation and selection process is conducted in a manner providing full and open competition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the bid solicitation and selection process is free of any real or apparent conflict of interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ix) Not later than September 30, 1996, the Secretary shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost containment contracts to be entered into by infant cereal manufacturers and State agencies. In carrying out this clause, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent feasible, follow the procedures prescribed in this subparagraph regarding offers made by the Secretary with regard to soliciting bids regarding infant formula cost containment contracts. The Secretary may carry out this clause without issuing regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H) In soliciting bids for contracts for infant formula for the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall solicit bids from infant formula manufacturers under procedures in which bids for rebates or discounts are solicited for milk-based and soy-based infant formula, separately, except where the Secretary determines that such solicitation procedures are not in the best interest of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I) To reduce the costs of any supplemental foods, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall promote, but not require, the joint purchase of infant formula among State agencies electing not to participate under the procedures set forth in subparagraph (G);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall encourage and promote (but not require) the purchase of supplemental foods other than infant formula under cost containment procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall inform State agencies of the benefits of cost containment and provide assistance and technical advice at State agency request regarding the State agency's use of cost containment procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) shall encourage (but not require) the joint purchase of supplemental foods other than infant formula under procedures specified in subparagraph (B), if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the anticipated savings are expected to be significant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the administrative expenses involved in purchasing the food item through competitive bidding procedures, whether under a rebate or discount system, will not exceed the savings anticipated to be generated by the procedures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) the procedures would be consistent with the purposes of the program; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) may make available additional funds to State agencies out of the funds otherwise available under paragraph (1)(A) for nutrition services and administration in an amount not exceeding one half of 1 percent of the amounts to help defray reasonable anticipated expenses associated with innovations in cost containment or associated with procedures that tend to enhance competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(K) Not later than the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on October 24, 1992, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(L) A State shall not incur any interest liability to the Federal Government on rebate funds for infant formula and other foods if all interest earned by the State on the funds is used for program purposes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(M)(i) The Secretary shall establish pilot projects in at least 1 State, with the consent of the State, to determine the feasibility and cost of requiring States to carry out a system for using universal product codes to assist retail food stores that are vendors under the program in providing the type of infant formula that the participants in the program are authorized to obtain. In carrying out the projects, the Secretary shall determine whether the system reduces the incidence of incorrect redemptions of low-iron formula or brands of infant formula not authorized to be redeemed through the program, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall provide a notification to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate regarding whether the system is feasible, is cost-effective, reduces the incidence of incorrect redemptions described in clause (i), and results in any additional costs to States.</p>
