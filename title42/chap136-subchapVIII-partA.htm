<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) meet the requirements for admission as a trainee of the State or local police force to which the participant will be assigned pursuant to section 14099(5) of this title, including achievement of satisfactory scores on any applicable examination, except that failure to meet the age requirement for a trainee of the State or local police shall not disqualify the applicant if the applicant will be of sufficient age upon completing an undergraduate course of study;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) possess the necessary mental and physical capabilities and emotional characteristics to discharge effectively the duties of a law enforcement officer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be of good character and demonstrate sincere motivation and dedication to law enforcement and public service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for purposes of taking a graduate course.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Director shall establish programs of training for Police Corps participants. Such programs may be carried out at up to 3 training centers established for this purpose and administered by the Director, or by contracting with existing State training facilities. The Director shall contract with a State training facility upon request of such facility if the Director determines that such facility offers a course of training substantially equivalent to the Police Corps training program described in this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director may enter into contracts with individuals, institutions of learning, and government agencies (including State and local police forces) to obtain the services of persons qualified to participate in and contribute to the training process.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Police Corps training authorized in this section is intended to serve as basic law enforcement training but not to exclude further training of participants by the State and local authorities to which they will be assigned. Each State plan approved by the Director under section 14099&nbsp;<sup><a href="#14097_1_target" name="14097_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall include assurances that following completion of a participant's course of education each participant shall receive appropriate additional training by the State or local authority to which the participant is assigned.

<p class="statutory-body">The training sessions at training centers established under this section shall be designed to provide basic law enforcement training, including vigorous physical and mental training to teach participants self-discipline and organizational loyalty and to impart knowledge and understanding of legal processes and law enforcement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Evaluation of participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A participant shall be evaluated during training for mental, physical, and emotional fitness, and shall be required to meet performance standards prescribed by the Director at the conclusion of each training session in order to remain in the Police Corps program.</p>
