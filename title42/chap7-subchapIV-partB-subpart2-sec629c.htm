<p class="statutory-body">From the amount reserved pursuant to section 629f(b)(3) of this title for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each Indian tribe with a plan approved under this subpart an amount that bears the same ratio to such reserved amount as the number of children in the Indian tribe bears to the total number of children in all Indian tribes with State plans so approved, as determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most current and reliable information available to the Secretary. If a consortium of Indian tribes submits a plan approved under this subpart, the Secretary shall allot to the consortium an amount equal to the sum of the allotments determined for each Indian tribe that is part of the consortium.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) &ldquo;Food stamp percentage&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">As used in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the term &ldquo;food stamp percentage&rdquo; means, with respect to a State and a fiscal year, the average monthly number of children receiving food stamp benefits in the State for months in the 3 fiscal years referred to in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, as determined from sample surveys made under section 2025(c) of title 7, expressed as a percentage of the average monthly number of children receiving food stamp benefits in the States described in such paragraph (1) for months in such 3 fiscal years, as so determined.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Fiscal years used in calculation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of the calculation pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall use data for the 3 most recent fiscal years, preceding the fiscal year for which the State's allotment is calculated under this subsection, for which such data are available to the Secretary.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Other States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the amount reserved pursuant to section 629f(b)(4)(A) of this title for any fiscal year that remains after applying paragraph (1) of this subsection for the fiscal year, the Secretary shall allot to each State (other than an Indian tribe) not specified in subsection (b) of this section, that has provided to the Secretary such documentation as may be necessary to verify that the State has complied with section 629f(b)(4)(B)(ii) of this title during the fiscal year, an amount equal to such remaining amount multiplied by the food stamp percentage of the State (as defined in subsection (c)(2) of this section) for the fiscal year, except that in applying subsection (c)(2)(A) of this section, &ldquo;subsection (e)(2)&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;such paragraph (1)&rdquo;.</p>
