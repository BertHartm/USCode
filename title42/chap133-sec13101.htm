<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States of America annually produces millions of tons of pollution and spends tens of billions of dollars per year controlling this pollution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There are significant opportunities for industry to reduce or prevent pollution at the source through cost-effective changes in production, operation, and raw materials use. Such changes offer industry substantial savings in reduced raw material, pollution control, and liability costs as well as help protect the environment and reduce risks to worker health and safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The opportunities for source reduction are often not realized because existing regulations, and the industrial resources they require for compliance, focus upon treatment and disposal, rather than source reduction; existing regulations do not emphasize multi-media management of pollution; and businesses need information and technical assistance to overcome institutional barriers to the adoption of source reduction practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Source reduction is fundamentally different and more desirable than waste management and pollution control. The Environmental Protection Agency needs to address the historical lack of attention to source reduction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) As a first step in preventing pollution through source reduction, the Environmental Protection Agency must establish a source reduction program which collects and disseminates information, provides financial assistance to States, and implements the other activities provided for in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby declares it to be the national policy of the United States that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally <!-- PDFPage:6201 -->safe manner, whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; and disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner.</p>
