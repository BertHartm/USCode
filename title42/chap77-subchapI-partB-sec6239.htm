Such amendment shall not be subject to the congressional review procedures contained in section 6421 of this title. In assessing alternatives in the development of such plans, the Secretary shall consider leasing privately owned storage facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Exemption from subtitle IV of title 49</h4>
