<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Eighty percent of cardiac arrests are caused by ventricular fibrillation, for which defibrillation is the only effective treatment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Sixty percent of all cardiac arrests occur outside the hospital. The average national survival rate for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest is only 5 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Communities that have established and implemented public access defibrillation programs have achieved average survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest as high as 50 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) According to the American Heart Association, wide use of defibrillators could save as many as 50,000 lives nationally each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Successful public access defibrillation programs ensure that cardiac arrest victims have access to early 911 notification, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early defibrillation, and early advanced care.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) designate, or provide for the establishment of, a single State agency, which may be an interdepartmental agency, as the sole agency for administering or supervising the administration of the State's health planning functions under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide for the establishment of a State health planning council, which shall include representatives of Federal, State, and local agencies (including as an ex officio member, if there is located in such State one or more hospitals or other health care facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the individual whom the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall have designated to serve on such council as the representative of the hospitals or other health care facilities of such Department which are located in such State) and nongovernmental organizations and groups concerned with health (including representation of the regional medical program or programs included in whole or in part within the State), and of consumers of health services, to advise such State agency in carrying out its functions under the plan, and a majority of the membership of such council shall consist of representatives of consumers of health services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) set forth policies and procedures for the expenditure of funds under the plan, which, in the judgment of the Secretary, are designed to provide for comprehensive State planning for health services (both public and private and including home health care), including the facilities and persons required for the provision of such services, to meet the health needs of the people of the State and including environmental considerations as they relate to public health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provide for encouraging cooperative efforts among governmental or nongovernmental agencies, organizations and groups concerned with health services, facilities, or manpower, and for cooperative efforts between such agencies, organizations, and groups and similar agencies, organizations, and groups in the fields of education, welfare, and rehabilitation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) provide that the State agency will make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary may from time to time reasonably require, and will keep such records and afford such access thereto as the Secretary finds necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) provide that the State agency will from time to time, but not less often than annually, review its State plan approved under this subsection and submit to the Secretary appropriate modifications thereof;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:163 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) effective July 1, 1968, (i) provide for assisting each health care facility in the State to develop a program for capital expenditures for replacement, modernization, and expansion which is consistent with an overall State plan developed in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary after consultation with the State which will meet the needs of the State for health care facilities, equipment, and services without duplication and otherwise in the most efficient and economical manner, and (ii) provide that the State agency furnishing such assistance will periodically review the program (developed pursuant to clause (i)) of each health care facility in the State and recommend appropriate modification thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) provide for such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure proper disbursement of and accounting for funds paid to the State under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) contain such additional information and assurances as the Secretary may find necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) From the sums appropriated for such purpose for each fiscal year, the several States shall be entitled to allotments determined, in accordance with regulations, on the basis of the population and the per capita income of the respective States; except that no such allotment to any State for any fiscal year shall be less than 1 per centum of the sum appropriated for such fiscal year pursuant to paragraph (1). Any such allotment to a State for a fiscal year shall remain available for obligation by the State, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection and the State's plan approved thereunder, until the close of the succeeding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Birth defects are the leading cause of infant mortality, directly responsible for one out of every five infant deaths.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Thousands of the 150,000 infants born with a serious birth defect annually face a lifetime of chronic disability and illness.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Birth defects threaten the lives of infants of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, some conditions pose excess risks for certain populations. For example, compared to all infants born in the United States, Hispanic-American infants are more likely to be born with anencephaly spina bifida and other neural tube defects and African-American infants are more likely to be born with sickle-cell anemia.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Birth defects can be caused by exposure to environmental hazards, adverse health conditions during pregnancy, or genetic mutations. Prevention efforts are slowed by lack of information about the number and causes of birth defects.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;247b&ndash;4a. Early detection, diagnosis, and interventions for newborns and infants with hearing loss</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section only, the following terms in this section are defined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Hearing screening</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Newborn and infant hearing screening consists of objective physiologic procedures to detect possible hearing loss and to identify newborns and infants who, after rescreening, require further audiologic and medical evaluations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Audiologic evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Audiologic evaluation consists of procedures to assess the status of the auditory system; to establish the site of the auditory disorder; the type and degree of hearing loss, and the potential effects of hearing loss on communication; and to identify appropriate treatment and referral options. Referral options should include linkage to State IDEA part C coordinating agencies or other appropriate agencies, medical evaluation, hearing aid/sensory aid assessment, audiologic rehabilitation treatment, national and local consumer, self-help, parent, and education organizations, and other family-centered services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Medical evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Medical evaluation by a physician consists of key components including history, examination, and medical decision making focused on symptomatic and related body systems for the purpose of diagnosing the etiology of hearing loss and related physical conditions, and for identifying appropriate treatment and referral options.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Medical intervention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Medical intervention is the process by which a physician provides medical diagnosis and direction for medical and/or surgical treatment options of hearing loss and/or related medical disorder associated with hearing loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Audiologic rehabilitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Audiologic rehabilitation (intervention) consists of procedures, techniques, and technologies to facilitate the receptive and expressive communication abilities of a child with hearing loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Early intervention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Early intervention (e.g., nonmedical) means providing appropriate services for the child with hearing loss and ensuring that families of the child are provided comprehensive, consumer-oriented information about the full range of family support, training, information services, communication options and are given the opportunity to consider the full range of educational and program placements and options for their child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are to clarify the authority within the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] to authorize statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems, technical assistance, a national applied research program, and interagency and private sector collaboration for policy development, in order to assist the States in making progress toward the following goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) All babies born in hospitals in the United States and its territories should have a hearing screening before leaving the birthing facility. Babies born in other countries and residing in the United States via immigration or adoption should have a hearing screening as early as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All babies who are not born in hospitals in the United States and its territories should have a hearing screening within the first 3 months of life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Appropriate audiologic and medical evaluations should be conducted by 3 months for all newborns and infants suspected of having hearing loss to allow appropriate referral and provisions for audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early intervention before the age of 6 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) All newborn and infant hearing screening programs and systems should include a component for audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early intervention options that ensures linkage to any new and existing statewide systems of intervention and rehabilitative services for newborns and infants with hearing loss.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Public policy in regard to newborn and infant hearing screening and intervention should be based on applied research and the recognition that newborns, infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing have unique language, learning, and communication needs, and should be the result of consultation with pertinent public and private sectors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the existing authority of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;), acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall make awards of grants or cooperative agreements to develop statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems for the following purposes:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To develop and monitor the efficacy of statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems. Early intervention includes referral to schools and agencies, including community, consumer, and parent-based agencies and organizations and other programs mandated by part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.], which offer programs specifically designed to meet the unique language and communication needs <!-- PDFPage:181 -->of deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, toddlers, and children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To collect data on statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems that can be used for applied research, program evaluation and policy development.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;84, &sect;2, Dec. 18, 2001, 115 Stat. 823, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Of the childhood muscular dystrophies, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the world's most common and catastrophic form of genetic childhood disease, and is characterized by a rapidly progressive muscle weakness that almost always results in death, usually by 20 years of age.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Duchenne muscular dystrophy is genetically inherited, and mothers are the carriers in approximately 70 percent of all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) If a female is a carrier of the dystrophin gene, there is a 50 percent chance per birth that her male offspring will have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and a 50 percent chance per birth that her female offspring will be carriers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Duchenne is the most common lethal genetic disorder of childhood worldwide, affecting approximately 1 in every 3,500 boys worldwide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Children with muscular dystrophy exhibit extreme symptoms of weakness, delay in walking, waddling gait, difficulty in climbing stairs, and progressive mobility problems often in combination with muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Other forms of muscular dystrophy affecting children and adults include Becker, limb girdle, congenital, facioscapulohumeral, myotonic, oculopharyngeal, distal, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Myotonic muscular dystrophy (also known as Steinert's disease and dystrophia myotonica) is the second most prominent form of muscular dystrophy and the type most commonly found in adults. Unlike any of the other muscular dystrophies, the muscle weakness is accompanied by myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction) and by a variety of abnormalities in addition to those of muscle.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (referred to in this section as &lsquo;FSHD&rsquo;) is a neuromuscular disorder that is inherited genetically and has an estimated frequency of 1 in 20,000. FSHD, affecting between 15,000 to 40,000 persons, causes a progressive and sever [sic] loss of skeletal muscle gradually bringing weakness and reduced mobility. Many persons with FSHD become severely physically disabled and spend many decades in a wheelchair.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) FSHD is regarded as a novel genetic phenomenon resulting from a crossover of subtelomeric DNA and may be the only human disease caused by a deletion-mutation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Each of the muscular dystrophies, though distinct in progressivity and severity of symptoms, have a devastating impact on tens of thousands of children and adults throughout the United States and worldwide and impose severe physical and economic burdens on those affected.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Muscular dystrophies have a significant impact on quality of life&mdash;not only for the individual who experiences its painful symptoms and resulting disability, but also for family members and caregivers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Development of therapies for these disorders, while realistic with recent advances in research, is likely to require costly investments and infrastructure to support gene and other therapies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) There is a shortage of qualified researchers in the field of neuromuscular research.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Many family physicians and health care professionals lack the knowledge and resources to detect and properly diagnose the disease as early as possible, thus exacerbating the progressiveness of symptoms in cases that go undetected or misdiagnosed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) There is a need for efficient mechanisms to translate clinically relevant findings in muscular dystrophy research from basic science to applied work.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Educating the public and health care community throughout the country about this devastating disease is of paramount importance and is in every respect in the public interest and to the benefit of all communities.&rdquo;</p>

L. 107&ndash;84, &sect;6, Dec. 18, 2001, 115 Stat. 829, provided that: &ldquo;Not later than January 1, 2003, and each January 1 thereafter, the Secretary [of Health and Human Services] shall prepare and submit to the appropriate committees of Congress, a report concerning the implementation of this Act [see Short Title of 2001 Amendment note set out under section 201 of this title] and the amendments made by this Act.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 411. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This subtitle may be cited as the &lsquo;Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Rural AED Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 412. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The American Heart Association estimates that 250,000 Americans die from sudden cardiac arrest each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A cardiac arrest victim's chance of survival drops 10 percent for every minute that passes before his or her heart is returned to normal rhythm.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because most cardiac arrest victims are initially in ventricular fibrillation, and the only treatment for ventricular fibrillation is defibrillation, prompt access to defibrillation to return the heart to normal rhythm is essential.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Lifesaving technology, the automated external defibrillator, has been developed to allow trained lay rescuers to respond to cardiac arrest by using this simple device to shock the heart into normal rhythm.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Those people who are likely to be first on the scene of a cardiac arrest situation in many communities, particularly smaller and rural communities, lack sufficient numbers of automated external defibrillators to respond to cardiac arrest in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The American Heart Association estimates that more than 50,000 deaths could be prevented each year if defibrillators were more widely available to designated responders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Legislation should be enacted to encourage greater public access to automated external defibrillators in communities across the United States.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 413. GRANTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Rural Health Outreach Office of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall award grants to community partnerships that meet the requirements of subsection (b) to enable such partnerships to purchase equipment and provide training as provided for in subsection (c).</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) evaluates the local community emergency response times to assess whether they meet the standards established by national public health organizations such as the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) submits to the Secretary of Health and Human Services an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Use of Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts provided under a grant under this section shall be used&mdash;</p>

The procedures under which the Secretary obtains data and prepares the report under this subsection shall not impose an undue burden on program participants under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 to carry out this section.&rdquo;</p>

Such a demonstration shall be made on the basis of the criteria prescribed by the Secretary under section 254e(b) of this title and on additional criteria which the Secretary shall prescribe to determine if the area or population group to be served by the applicant has a shortage of personal health services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Corps members may be assigned to a Federal health care facility, but only upon the request of the head of the department or agency of which such facility is a part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to analyze the potential use of health professions personnel in defined health services delivery areas by the residents of such areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to determine the need for such personnel in such areas and to recruit, select, and retain health professions personnel (including members of the National Health Service Corps) to meet such need;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:274 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) If the individuals in or served by a health professional shortage area are being served (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) by a hospital or other health care delivery facility of the Service, the Secretary may, in addition to such other arrangements as he may make under paragraph (1), arrange for the utilization of such hospital or facility by Corps members in providing health services, but only to the extent that such utilization will not impair the delivery of health services and treatment through such hospital or facility to individuals who are entitled to health services and treatment through such hospital or facility.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any hospital which is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record, to have violated this subsection shall upon such finding cease, for a period to be determined by the Secretary, to receive and to be eligible to receive any Federal funds under this chapter or under titles XVIII, XIX, or XXI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq., 1397aa et seq.].</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Promulgation and enforcement by Surgeon General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Surgeon General, with the approval of the Secretary, is authorized to make and enforce such regulations as in his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession. For purposes of carrying out and enforcing such regulations, the Surgeon General may provide for such inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, destruction of animals or articles found to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous infection to human beings, and other measures, as in his judgment may be necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Regulations prescribed under this section shall not provide for the apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals except for the purpose of preventing the introduction, transmission, or spread of such communicable diseases as may be specified from time to time in Executive orders of the President upon the recommendation of the Secretary, in consultation with the Surgeon General,<sup><a href="#264_1_target" name="264_1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application of regulations to persons entering from foreign countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, regulations prescribed under this section, insofar as they provide for the apprehension, detention, examination, or conditional release of individuals, shall be applicable only to individuals coming into a State or possession from a foreign country or a possession.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Apprehension and examination of persons reasonably believed to be infected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations prescribed under this section may provide for the apprehension and examination of any individual reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease in a qualifying stage and (A) to be moving or about to move from a State to another State; or (B) to be a probable source of infection to individuals who, while infected with such disease in a qualifying stage, will be moving from a State to another State. Such regulations may provide that if upon examination any such individual is found to be infected, he may be detained for such time and in such manner as may be reasonably necessary. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes, in addition to the several States, only the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualifying stage&rdquo;, with respect to a communicable disease, means that such disease&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is in a communicable stage; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is in a precommunicable stage, if the disease would be likely to cause a public health emergency if transmitted to other individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or section 266 of this title, or the regulations promulgated under such sections, may be construed as superseding any provision under State law (including regulations and including provisions established by political subdivisions of States), except to the extent that such a provision conflicts with an exercise of Federal authority under this section or section 266 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Control and management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in title II of the Act of June 15, 1917, as amended [50 U.S.C. 191 et seq.], the Surgeon General shall control, direct, and manage all United States quarantine stations, grounds, and anchorages, designate their boundaries, and designate the quarantine officers to be in charge thereof. With the approval of the President he shall from time to time select suitable sites for and establish such additional stations, grounds, and anchorages in the States and possessions of the United States as in his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction of communicable diseases into the States and possessions of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hours of inspection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Surgeon General shall establish the hours during which quarantine service shall be performed at each quarantine station, and, upon application by any interested party, may establish quarantine inspection during the twenty-four hours of the day, or any fraction thereof, at such quarantine stations as, in his opinion, require such extended service. He may restrict the performance of quarantine inspection to hours of daylight for such arriving vessels as cannot, in his opinion, be satisfactorily inspected during hours of darkness. No vessel shall be required to undergo quarantine inspection during the hours of darkness, unless the quarantine officer at such quarantine station shall deem an immediate inspection necessary to protect the public health. Uniformity shall not be required in the hours during which quarantine inspection may be obtained at the various ports of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Overtime pay for employees of Service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Surgeon General shall fix a reasonable rate of extra compensation for overtime services of employees of the United States Public Health Service, Foreign Quarantine Division, performing overtime duties including the operation of vessels, in connection with the inspection or quarantine treatment of persons (passengers and crews), conveyances, or goods arriving by land, water, or air in the United States or any place subject to the jurisdiction thereof, hereinafter referred to as &ldquo;employees of the Public Health Service&rdquo;, when required to be on duty between the hours of 6 o'clock postmeridian and 6 o'clock antemeridian (or between the hours of 7 o'clock postmeridian and 7 o'clock antemeridian at stations which have a declared workday of from 7 o'clock antemeridian to 7 o'clock postmeridian), or on Sundays or holidays, such rate, in lieu of compensation under any other provision of law, to be fixed at two times the basic hourly rate for each hour that the overtime extends beyond 6 o'clock (or 7 o'clock as the case may be) postmeridian, and two times the basic hourly rate for each overtime hour worked on Sundays or holidays. As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;basic hourly rate&rdquo; shall mean the regular basic rate of pay which is applicable to such employees for work performed within their regular scheduled tour of duty.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment of extra compensation to United States; bond or deposit to assure payment; deposit of moneys to credit of appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The said extra compensation shall be paid to the United States by the owner, agent, consignee, operator, or master or other person in charge of any conveyance, for whom, at his request, services as described in this subsection (hereinafter referred to as overtime service) are performed. If such employees have been ordered to report for duty and have so reported, and the requested services are not performed by reason of circumstances beyond the control of the employees concerned, such extra compensation shall be paid on the same basis as though the overtime services had actually been performed during the period between the time the employees were ordered to report for duty and did so report, and the time they were notified that their services would not be required, and in any case as though their services had continued for not less than one hour. The Surgeon General with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services may prescribe regulations requiring the owner, agent, consignee, operator, or master or other person for whom the overtime services are performed to file a bond in such amounts and containing such conditions and with such sureties, or in lieu of a bond, to deposit money or obligations of the United States in such amount, as will assure the payment of charges under this subsection, which bond or deposit may cover one or more transactions or all transactions during a specified period: <em>Provided</em>, That no charges shall be made for services performed in connection with the inspection of (1) persons arriving by international highways, ferries, bridges, or tunnels, or the conveyances in which they arrive, or (2) persons arriving by aircraft or railroad trains, the operations of which are covered by published schedules, or the aircraft or trains in which they arrive, or (3) persons arriving by vessels operated between Canadian ports and ports on Puget Sound or operated on the Great Lakes and connecting waterways, the operations of which are covered by published schedules, or the vessels in which they arrive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Moneys collected under this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the appropriation charged with the expense of the services, and the appropriations so credited shall be available for the payment of such compensation to the said employees for services so rendered.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is the leading preventable cause of mental retardation, and it is 100 percent preventable;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) estimates on the number of children each year vary, but according to some researchers, up to 12,000 infants are born in the United States with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome, suffering irreversible physical and mental damage;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) thousands more infants are born each year with Fetal Alcohol Effect, also known as Alcohol Related Neurobehavioral Disorder (ARND), a related and equally tragic syndrome;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) children of women who use alcohol while pregnant have a significantly higher infant mortality rate (13.3 per 1,000) than children of those women who do not use alcohol (8.6 per 1,000);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect are national problems which can impact any child, family, or community, but their threat to American Indians and Alaska Natives is especially alarming;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) in some American Indian communities, where alcohol dependency rates reach 50 percent and above, the chances of a newborn suffering Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect are up to 30 times greater than national averages;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) in addition to the immeasurable toll on children and their families, Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect pose extraordinary financial costs to the Nation, including the costs of health care, education, foster care, job training, and general support services for affected individuals;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the total cost to the economy of Fetal Alcohol Syndrome was approximately $2,500,000,000 in 1995, and over a lifetime, health care costs for one Fetal Alcohol Syndrome child are estimated to be at least $1,400,000;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) researchers have determined that the possibility of giving birth to a baby with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect increases in proportion to the amount and frequency of alcohol consumed by a pregnant woman, and that stopping alcohol consumption at any point in the pregnancy reduces the emotional, physical, and mental consequences of alcohol exposure to the baby; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) though approximately 1 out of every 5 pregnant women drink alcohol during their pregnancy, we know of no safe dose of alcohol during pregnancy, or of any safe time to drink during pregnancy, thus, it is in the best interest of the Nation for the Federal Government to take an active role in encouraging all women to abstain from alcohol consumption during pregnancy.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Purpose</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the purpose of this section [enacting this part and provisions set out as a note under section 201 of this title] to establish, within the Department of Health and Human Services, a comprehensive program to help prevent Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect nationwide and to provide effective intervention programs and services for children, adolescents and adults already affected by these conditions. Such program shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:382 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) coordinate, support, and conduct national, State, and community-based public awareness, prevention, and education programs on Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) coordinate, support, and conduct prevention and intervention studies as well as epidemiologic research concerning Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) coordinate, support and conduct research and demonstration projects to develop effective developmental and behavioral interventions and programs that foster effective advocacy, educational and vocational training, appropriate therapies, counseling, medical and mental health, and other supportive services, as well as models that integrate or coordinate such services, aimed at the unique challenges facing individuals with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome or Fetal Alcohol Effect and their families; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) foster coordination among all Federal, State and local agencies, and promote partnerships between research institutions and communities that conduct or support Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect research, programs, surveillance, prevention, and interventions and otherwise meet the general needs of populations already affected or at risk of being impacted by Fetal Alcohol Syndrome and Fetal Alcohol Effect.&rdquo;</p>
