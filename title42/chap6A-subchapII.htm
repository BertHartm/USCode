<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13505. Removing Barriers to Responsible Scientific Research Involving Human Stem Cells</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13505, Mar. 9, 2009, 74 F.R. 10667, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Research involving human embryonic stem cells and human non-embryonic stem cells has the potential to lead to better understanding and treatment of many disabling diseases and conditions. Advances over the past decade in this promising scientific field have been encouraging, leading to broad agreement in the scientific community that the research should be supported by Federal funds.</p>
<p class="note-body">For the past 8 years, the authority of the Department of Health and Human Services, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to fund and conduct human embryonic stem cell research has been limited by Presidential actions. The purpose of this order is to remove these limitations on scientific inquiry, to expand NIH support for the exploration of human stem cell research, and in so doing to enhance the contribution of America's scientists to important new discoveries and new therapies for the benefit of humankind.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Research</em>. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary), through the Director of NIH, may support and conduct responsible, scientifically worthy human stem cell research, including human embryonic stem cell research, to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Guidance</em>. Within 120 days from the date of this order, the Secretary, through the Director of NIH, shall review existing NIH guidance and other widely recognized guidelines on human stem cell research, including provisions establishing appropriate safeguards, and issue new NIH guidance on such research that is consistent with this order. The Secretary, through NIH, shall review and update such guidance periodically, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>General Provisions</em>. (a) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(i) authority granted by law to an executive department, agency, or the head thereof; or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(ii) functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity, by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Revocations</em>. (a) The Presidential statement of August 9, 2001, limiting Federal funding for research involving human embryonic stem cells, shall have no further effect as a statement of governmental policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Executive Order 13435 of June 20, 2007, which supplements the August 9, 2001, statement on human embryonic stem cell research, is revoked.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, July 30, 2009, 74 F.R. 38885, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">As outlined in Executive Order 13505 of March 9, 2009, my Administration is committed to supporting and conducting ethically responsible, scientifically worthy human stem cell research, including human embryonic stem cell research, to the extent permitted by law. Pursuant to that order, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) published final &ldquo;National Institutes of Health Guidelines for Human Stem Cell Research&rdquo; (Guidelines), effective July 7, 2009. These Guidelines apply to the expenditure of NIH funds for research using human embryonic stem cells and certain uses of human induced pluripotent stem cells. The Guidelines are based on the principles that responsible research with human embryonic stem cells has the potential to improve our understanding of human biology and aid in the discovery of new ways to prevent and treat illness, and that individuals donating embryos for research purposes should do so freely, with voluntary and informed consent. These Guidelines will ensure that NIH-funded research adheres to the highest ethical standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to ensure that all federally funded human stem cell research is conducted according to these same principles and to promote a uniform Federal policy across the executive branch, I hereby direct the heads of executive departments and agencies that support and conduct stem cell research to adopt these Guidelines, to the fullest extent practicable in light of legal authorities and obligations. I also direct those departments and agencies to submit to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), within 90 days, proposed additions or revisions to any other guidance, policies, or procedures related to human stem cell research, consistent with Executive Order 13505 and this memorandum. The Director of the OMB shall, in coordination with the Director of NIH, review these proposals to ensure consistent implementation of Executive Order 13505 and this memorandum.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person. Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their statutory and regulatory authorities and their enforcement mechanisms.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the OMB is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Comprehensive health planning and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to assist the States in comprehensive and continuing planning for their current and future health needs, the Secretary is authorized during the period beginning July 1, 1966, and ending June 30, 1973, to make grants to States which have submitted, and had approved by the Secretary, State plans for comprehensive State health planning. For the purposes of carrying out this subsection, there are hereby authorized to be appropriated $2,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, $7,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968, $10,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, $15,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, $15,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971, $17,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972, $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, and $10,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to be approved for purposes of this subsection, a State plan for comprehensive State health planning must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) designate, or provide for the establishment of, a single State agency, which may be an interdepartmental agency, as the sole agency for administering or supervising the administration of the State's health planning functions under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide for the establishment of a State health planning council, which shall include representatives of Federal, State, and local agencies (including as an ex officio member, if there is located in such State one or more hospitals or other health care facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the individual whom the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall have designated to serve on such council as the representative of the hospitals or other health care facilities of such Department which are located in such State) and nongovernmental organizations and groups concerned with health (including representation of the regional medical program or programs included in whole or in part within the State), and of consumers of health services, to advise such State agency in carrying out its functions under the plan, and a majority of the membership of such council shall consist of representatives of consumers of health services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) set forth policies and procedures for the expenditure of funds under the plan, which, in the judgment of the Secretary, are designed to provide for comprehensive State planning for health services (both public and private and including home health care), including the facilities and persons required for the provision of such services, to meet the health needs of the people of the State and including environmental considerations as they relate to public health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provide for encouraging cooperative efforts among governmental or nongovernmental agencies, organizations and groups concerned with health services, facilities, or manpower, and for cooperative efforts between such agencies, organizations, and groups and similar agencies, organizations, and groups in the fields of education, welfare, and rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) contain or be supported by assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the funds paid under this subsection will be used to supplement and, to the extent practicable, to increase the level of funds that would otherwise be made available by the State for the purpose of comprehensive health planning and not to supplant such non-Federal funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) provide such methods of administration (including methods relating to the establishment and maintenance of personnel standards on a merit basis, except that the Secretary shall exercise no authority with respect to the selection, tenure of office, and compensation of any individual employed in accordance with such methods) as are found by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) provide that the State agency will make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary may from time to time reasonably require, and will keep such records and afford such access thereto as the Secretary finds necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) provide that the State agency will from time to time, but not less often than annually, review its State plan approved under this subsection and submit to the Secretary appropriate modifications thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) effective July 1, 1968, (i) provide for assisting each health care facility in the State to develop a program for capital expenditures for replacement, modernization, and expansion which is consistent with an overall State plan developed in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary after consultation with the State which will meet the needs of the State for health care facilities, equipment, and services without duplication and otherwise in the most efficient and economical manner, and (ii) provide that the State agency furnishing such assistance will periodically review the program (developed pursuant to clause (i)) of each health care facility in the State and recommend appropriate modification thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(J) provide for such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to assure proper disbursement of and accounting for funds paid to the State under this subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(K) contain such additional information and assurances as the Secretary may find necessary to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) From the sums appropriated for such purpose for each fiscal year, the several States <!-- PDFPage:146 -->shall be entitled to allotments determined, in accordance with regulations, on the basis of the population and the per capita income of the respective States; except that no such allotment to any State for any fiscal year shall be less than 1 per centum of the sum appropriated for such fiscal year pursuant to paragraph (1). Any such allotment to a State for a fiscal year shall remain available for obligation by the State, in accordance with the provisions of this subsection and the State's plan approved thereunder, until the close of the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount of any allotment to a State under subparagraph (A) for any fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required by the State, during the period for which it is available, for the purposes for which allotted shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary from time to time, on such date or dates as he may fix, to other States with respect to which such a determination has not been made, in proportion to the original allotments to such States under subparagraph (A) for such fiscal year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such State needs and will be able to use during such period; and the total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount so reallotted to a State from funds appropriated pursuant to this subsection for a fiscal year shall be deemed part of its allotment under subparagraph (A) for such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) From each State's allotment for a fiscal year under this subsection, the State shall from time to time be paid the Federal share of the expenditures incurred during that year or the succeeding year pursuant to its State plan approved under this subsection. Such payments shall be made on the basis of estimates by the Secretary of the sums the State will need in order to perform the planning under its approved State plan under this subsection, but with such adjustments as may be necessary to take account of previously made underpayments or overpayments. The &ldquo;Federal share&rdquo; for any State for purposes of this subsection shall be all, or such part as the Secretary may determine, of the cost of such planning, except that in the case of the allotments for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, it shall not exceed 75 per centum of such cost.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Project grants for areawide health planning; authorization of appropriations; prerequisites for grants; application; contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary is authorized, during the period beginning July 1, 1966, and ending June 30, 1974, to make, with the approval of the State agency administering or supervising the administration of the State plan approved under subsection (a) of this section, project grants to any other public or nonprofit private agency or organization (but with appropriate representation of the interests of local government where the recipient of the grant is not a local government or combination thereof or an agency of such government or combination) to cover not to exceed 75 per centum of the costs of projects for developing (and from time to time revising) comprehensive regional, metropolitan area, or other local area plans for coordination of existing and planned health services, including the facilities and persons required for provision of such services; and including the provision of such services through home health care; except that in the case of project grants made in any State prior to July 1, 1968, approval of such State agency shall be required only if such State has such a State plan in effect at the time of such grants. No grant may be made under this subsection after June 30, 1970, to any agency or organization to develop or revise health plans for an area unless the Secretary determines that such agency or organization provides means for appropriate representation of the interests of the hospitals, other health care facilities, and practicing physicians serving such area, and the general public. For the purposes of carrying out this subsection, there are hereby authorized to be appropriated $5,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, $7,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968, $10,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, $15,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, $20,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971, $30,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972, $40,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, and $25,100,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Project grants may be made by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) to the State agency administering or supervising the administration of the State plan approved under subsection (a) of this section with respect to a particular region or area, but only if (i) no application for such a grant with respect to such region or area has been filed by any other agency or organization qualified to receive such a grant, and (ii) such State agency certifies, and the Secretary finds, that ample opportunity has been afforded to qualified agencies and organizations to file application for such a grant with respect to such region or area and that it is improbable that, in the foreseeable future, any agency or organization which is qualified for such a grant will file application therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to be approved under this subsection, an application for a grant under this subsection must contain or be supported by reasonable assurances that there has been or will be established, in or for the area with respect to which such grant is sought, an areawide health planning council. The membership of such council shall include representatives of public, voluntary, and nonprofit private agencies, institutions, and organizations concerned with health (including representatives of the interests of local government of the regional medical program for such area, and of consumers of health services). A majority of the members of such council shall consist of representatives of consumers of health services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In addition, an application for a grant under this subsection must contain or be supported by reasonable assurances that the areawide health planning agency has made provision for assisting health care facilities in its area to develop a program for capital expenditures for replacement, modernization, and expansion <!-- PDFPage:147 -->which is consistent with an overall State plan which will meet the needs of the State and the area for health care facilities, equipment, and services without duplication and otherwise in the most efficient and economical manner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Project grants for training, studies, and demonstrations; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is also authorized, during the period beginning July 1, 1966, and ending June 30, 1974, to make grants to any public or nonprofit private agency, institution, or other organization to cover all or any part of the cost of projects for training, studies, or demonstrations looking toward the development of improved or more effective comprehensive health planning throughout the Nation. For the purposes of carrying out this subsection, there are hereby authorized to be appropriated $1,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1967, $2,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1968, $5,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1969, $7,500,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1970, $8,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1971, $10,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1972, $12,000,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, and $4,700,000 for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1974.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Birth defects threaten the lives of infants of all racial and ethnic backgrounds. However, some conditions pose excess risks for certain populations. For example, compared to all infants born in the United States, Hispanic-American infants are more likely to be born with anencephaly spina bifida and other neural tube defects and African-American infants are more likely to be born with sickle-cell anemia.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;247b&ndash;4a. Early detection, diagnosis, and interventions for newborns and infants with hearing loss</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section only, the following terms in this section are defined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Hearing screening</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Newborn and infant hearing screening consists of objective physiologic procedures to detect possible hearing loss and to identify newborns and infants who, after rescreening, require further audiologic and medical evaluations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Audiologic evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Audiologic evaluation consists of procedures to assess the status of the auditory system; to establish the site of the auditory disorder; the type and degree of hearing loss, and the potential effects of hearing loss on communication; and to identify appropriate treatment and referral options. Referral options should include linkage to State IDEA part C coordinating agencies or other appropriate agencies, medical evaluation, hearing aid/sensory aid assessment, audiologic rehabilitation treatment, national and local consumer, self-help, parent, and education organizations, and other family-centered services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Medical evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Medical evaluation by a physician consists of key components including history, examination, and medical decision making focused on symptomatic and related body systems for the purpose of diagnosing the etiology of hearing loss and related physical conditions, and for identifying appropriate treatment and referral options.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Medical intervention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Medical intervention is the process by which a physician provides medical diagnosis and direction for medical and/or surgical treatment options of hearing loss and/or related medical disorder associated with hearing loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Audiologic rehabilitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Audiologic rehabilitation (intervention) consists of procedures, techniques, and technologies to facilitate the receptive and expressive communication abilities of a child with hearing loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Early intervention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Early intervention (e.g., nonmedical) means providing appropriate services for the child with hearing loss and ensuring that families of the child are provided comprehensive, consumer-oriented information about the full range of family support, training, information services, communication options and are given the opportunity to consider the full range of educational and program placements and options for their child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are to clarify the authority within the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.] to authorize statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems, technical assistance, a national applied research program, and interagency and private sector collaboration for policy development, in order to assist the States in making progress toward the following goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) All babies born in hospitals in the United States and its territories should have a hearing screening before leaving the birthing facility. Babies born in other countries and residing in the United States via immigration or adoption should have a hearing screening as early as possible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All babies who are not born in hospitals in the United States and its territories should have a hearing screening within the first 3 months of life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Appropriate audiologic and medical evaluations should be conducted by 3 months for all newborns and infants suspected of having hearing loss to allow appropriate referral and provisions for audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early intervention before the age of 6 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) All newborn and infant hearing screening programs and systems should include a component for audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early intervention options that ensures linkage to any new and existing statewide systems of intervention and rehabilitative services for newborns and infants with hearing loss.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Public policy in regard to newborn and infant hearing screening and intervention should be based on applied research and the recognition that newborns, infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing have unique language, learning, and communication needs, and should be the result of consultation with pertinent public and private sectors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the existing authority of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;), acting through the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall make awards of grants or cooperative agreements to develop statewide newborn and infant <!-- PDFPage:165 -->hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems for the following purposes:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To develop and monitor the efficacy of statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems. Early intervention includes referral to schools and agencies, including community, consumer, and parent-based agencies and organizations and other programs mandated by part C of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [20 U.S.C. 1431 et seq.], which offer programs specifically designed to meet the unique language and communication needs of deaf and hard-of-hearing newborns, infants, toddlers, and children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To collect data on statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems that can be used for applied research, program evaluation and policy development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Technical assistance, data management, and applied research</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under the existing authority of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, shall make awards of grants or cooperative agreements to provide technical assistance to State agencies to complement an intramural program and to conduct applied research related to newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems. The program shall develop standardized procedures for data management and program effectiveness and costs, such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to ensure quality monitoring of newborn and infant hearing loss screening, evaluation, and intervention programs and systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to provide technical assistance on data collection and management;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to study the costs and effectiveness of newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems conducted by State-based programs in order to answer issues of importance to State and national policymakers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to identify the causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to study the effectiveness of newborn and infant hearing screening, audiologic and medical evaluations and intervention programs and systems by assessing the health, intellectual and social developmental, cognitive, and language status of these children at school age; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to promote the sharing of data regarding early hearing loss with State-based birth defects and developmental disabilities monitoring programs for the purpose of identifying previously unknown causes of hearing loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) National Institutes of Health</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under the existing authority of the Public Health Service Act, the Director of the National Institutes of Health, acting through the Director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, shall for purposes of this section, continue a program of research and development on the efficacy of new screening techniques and technology, including clinical studies of screening methods, studies on efficacy of intervention, and related research.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 107&ndash;84, &sect;2, Dec. 18, 2001, 115 Stat. 823, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Of the childhood muscular dystrophies, Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) is the world's most common and catastrophic form of genetic childhood disease, and is characterized by a rapidly progressive muscle weakness that almost always results in death, usually by 20 years of age.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Duchenne muscular dystrophy is genetically inherited, and mothers are the carriers in approximately 70 percent of all cases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) If a female is a carrier of the dystrophin gene, there is a 50 percent chance per birth that her male offspring will have Duchenne muscular dystrophy, and a 50 percent chance per birth that her female offspring will be carriers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Duchenne is the most common lethal genetic disorder of childhood worldwide, affecting approximately 1 in every 3,500 boys worldwide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Children with muscular dystrophy exhibit extreme symptoms of weakness, delay in walking, waddling gait, difficulty in climbing stairs, and progressive mobility problems often in combination with muscle hypertrophy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Other forms of muscular dystrophy affecting children and adults include Becker, limb girdle, congenital, facioscapulohumeral, myotonic, oculopharyngeal, distal, and Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Myotonic muscular dystrophy (also known as Steinert's disease and dystrophia myotonica) is the second most prominent form of muscular dystrophy and the type most commonly found in adults. Unlike any of the other muscular dystrophies, the muscle weakness is accompanied by myotonia (delayed relaxation of muscles after contraction) and by a variety of abnormalities in addition to those of muscle.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (referred to in this section as &lsquo;FSHD&rsquo;) is a neuromuscular disorder that is inherited genetically and has an estimated frequency of 1 in 20,000. FSHD, affecting between 15,000 to 40,000 persons, causes a progressive and sever [sic] loss of skeletal muscle gradually bringing weakness and reduced mobility. Many persons with FSHD become severely physically disabled and spend many decades in a wheelchair.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) FSHD is regarded as a novel genetic phenomenon resulting from a crossover of subtelomeric DNA and may be the only human disease caused by a deletion-mutation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Each of the muscular dystrophies, though distinct in progressivity and severity of symptoms, have a devastating impact on tens of thousands of children and adults throughout the United States and worldwide and impose severe physical and economic burdens on those affected.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Muscular dystrophies have a significant impact on quality of life&mdash;not only for the individual who experiences its painful symptoms and resulting disability, but also for family members and caregivers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Development of therapies for these disorders, while realistic with recent advances in research, is likely to require costly investments and infrastructure to support gene and other therapies.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) There is a shortage of qualified researchers in the field of neuromuscular research.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Many family physicians and health care professionals lack the knowledge and resources to detect and properly diagnose the disease as early as possible, thus exacerbating the progressiveness of symptoms in cases that go undetected or misdiagnosed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) There is a need for efficient mechanisms to translate clinically relevant findings in muscular dystrophy research from basic science to applied work.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Educating the public and health care community throughout the country about this devastating disease is of paramount importance and is in every respect in the public interest and to the benefit of all communities.&rdquo;</p>

The Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, make the determination of advance payment at the same time as the issuance of a solicitation.

<h4 class="subclause-head">(III) Contract duration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The contract shall be for a period not to exceed five years, except that, in first awarding the contract, the Secretary may provide for a longer duration, not exceeding eight years, if the Secretary determines that complexities or other difficulties in performance under the contract justify such a period. The contract shall be renewable for additional periods, none of which shall exceed five years.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(IV) Storage by vendor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The contract may provide that the vendor will provide storage for stocks of a product delivered to the ownership of the Federal Government under the contract, for such period and under such terms and conditions as the Secretary may specify, and in such case amounts from the special reserve fund under paragraph (10) shall be available for costs of shipping, handling, storage, and related costs for such product.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(V) Product approval</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">The contract may provide that the vendor is the exclusive supplier of the product to the Federal Government for a specified period of time, not to exceed the term of the contract, on the condition that the vendor is able to satisfy the needs of the Government. During the agreed period of sales exclusivity, the vendor shall not assign its rights of sales exclusivity to another entity or entities without approval by the Secretary. Such a sales exclusivity provision in such a contract shall constitute a valid basis for a sole source procurement under section 3304(a)(1) of title 41.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(VIII) Warm based surge capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The contract may provide that the vendor establish domestic manufacturing capacity of the product to ensure that additional production of the product is available in the event that the Secretary determines that there is a need to quickly purchase additional quantities of the product. Such contract may provide a fee to the vendor for establishing and maintaining such capacity in excess of the initial requirement for the purchase of the product. Additionally, the cost of maintaining the domestic manufacturing capacity shall be an allowable and allocable direct cost of the contract.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Medicare Demonstration To Test Medical Homes in Federally Qualified Health Centers</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Dec. 9, 2009, 74 F.R. 66207, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Health And Human Services</p>
<p class="note-body">My Administration is committed to building a high-quality, efficient health care system and improving access to health care for all Americans. Health centers are a vital part of the health care delivery system. For more than 40 years, health centers have served populations with limited access to health care, treating all patients regardless of ability to pay. These include low-income populations, the uninsured, individuals with limited English proficiency, migrant and seasonal farm workers, individuals and families experiencing homelessness, and individuals living in public housing. There are over 1,100 health centers across the country, delivering care at over 7,500 sites. These centers served more than 17 million patients in 2008 and are estimated to serve more than 20 million patients in 2010.</p>
<p class="note-body">The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act) provided $2 billion for health centers, including $500 million to expand health centers&rsquo; services to over 2 million new patients by opening new health center sites, adding new providers, and improving hours of operations. An additional $1.5 billion is supporting much-needed capital improvements, including funding to buy equipment, modernize clinic facilities, expand into new facilities, and adopt or expand the use of health information technology and electronic health records.</p>
<p class="note-body">One of the key benefits health centers provide to the communities they serve is quality primary health care services. Health centers use interdisciplinary teams to treat the &ldquo;whole patient&rdquo; and focus on chronic disease management to reduce the use of costlier providers of care, such as emergency rooms and hospitals.</p>
<p class="note-body">Federally qualified health centers provide an excellent environment to demonstrate the further improvements to health care that may be offered by the medical homes approach. In general, this approach emphasizes the patient's relationship with a primary care provider who coordinates the patient's care and serves as the patient's principal point of contact for care. The medical homes approach also emphasizes activities related to quality improvement, access to care, communication with patients, and care management and coordination. These activities are expected to improve the quality and efficiency of care and to help avoid preventable emergency and inpatient hospital care. Demonstration programs establishing the medical homes approach have been recommended by the Medicare Pay<!-- PDFPage:270 -->ment Advisory Commission, an independent advisory body to the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Therefore, I direct you to implement a Medicare Federally Qualified Health Center Advanced Primary Care Practice demonstration, pursuant to your statutory authority to conduct experiments and demonstrations on changes in payments and services that may improve the quality and efficiency of services to beneficiaries. Health centers participating in this demonstration must have shown their ability to provide comprehensive, coordinated, integrated, and accessible health care.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;505, title IV, subtitle B, Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2340, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 411. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This subtitle may be cited as the &lsquo;Rural Access to Emergency Devices Act&rsquo; or the &lsquo;Rural AED Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 412. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The American Heart Association estimates that 250,000 Americans die from sudden cardiac arrest each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A cardiac arrest victim's chance of survival drops 10 percent for every minute that passes before his or her heart is returned to normal rhythm.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because most cardiac arrest victims are initially in ventricular fibrillation, and the only treatment for ventricular fibrillation is defibrillation, prompt access to defibrillation to return the heart to normal rhythm is essential.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Lifesaving technology, the automated external defibrillator, has been developed to allow trained lay rescuers to respond to cardiac arrest by using this simple device to shock the heart into normal rhythm.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Those people who are likely to be first on the scene of a cardiac arrest situation in many communities, particularly smaller and rural communities, lack sufficient numbers of automated external defibrillators to respond to cardiac arrest in a timely manner.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The American Heart Association estimates that more than 50,000 deaths could be prevented each year if defibrillators were more widely available to designated responders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Legislation should be enacted to encourage greater public access to automated external defibrillators in communities across the United States.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 413. GRANTS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the Rural Health Outreach Office of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall award grants to community partnerships that meet the requirements of subsection (b) to enable such partnerships to purchase equipment and provide training as provided for in subsection (c).</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) is composed of local emergency response entities such as community training facilities, local <!-- PDFPage:274 -->emergency responders, fire and rescue departments, police, community hospitals, and local non-profit entities and for-profit entities concerned about cardiac arrest survival rates;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) evaluates the local community emergency response times to assess whether they meet the standards established by national public health organizations such as the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) submits to the Secretary of Health and Human Services an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary may require.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Use of Funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Amounts provided under a grant under this section shall be used&mdash;</p>

The procedures under which the Secretary obtains data and prepares the report under this subsection shall not impose an undue burden on program participants under this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(e) <cap-smallcap>Authorization of Appropriations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There is authorized to be appropriated $25,000,000 for fiscal years 2001 through 2003 to carry out this section.&rdquo;</p>

The Secretary shall promulgate regulations pursuant to the rulemaking requirements of title 5 which shall govern payments made under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Pro rata reductions of payments for direct expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines that the amount of funds appropriated under sub<!-- PDFPage:346 -->section (f)(1) of this section for a fiscal year is insufficient to provide the total amount of payments otherwise due for such periods under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary shall reduce the amounts so payable on a pro rata basis to reflect such shortfall.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual reporting required</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Reduction in payment for failure to report</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount payable under this section to a children's hospital for a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2008 and after taking into account paragraph (2)) shall be reduced by 25 percent if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the hospital has failed to provide the Secretary, as an addendum to the hospital's application under this section for such fiscal year, the report required under subparagraph (B) for the previous fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) such report fails to provide the information required under any clause of such subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Notice and opportunity to provide missing information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Before imposing a reduction under clause (i) on the basis of a hospital's failure to provide information described in clause (i)(II), the Secretary shall provide notice to the hospital of such failure and the Secretary's intention to impose such reduction and shall provide the hospital with the opportunity to provide the required information within a period of 30 days beginning on the date of such notice. If the hospital provides such information within such period, no reduction shall be made under clause (i) on the basis of the previous failure to provide such information.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Annual report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The report required under this subparagraph for a children's hospital for a fiscal year is a report that includes (in a form and manner specified by the Secretary) the following information for the residency academic year completed immediately prior to such fiscal year:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The types of resident training programs that the hospital provided for residents described in subparagraph (C), such as general pediatrics, internal medicine/pediatrics, and pediatric subspecialties, including both medical subspecialties certified by the American Board of Pediatrics (such as pediatric gastroenterology) and non-medical subspecialties approved by other medical certification boards (such as pediatric surgery).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) changes in curricula, training experiences, and types of training programs, and benefits that have resulted from such changes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) changes for purposes of training the residents in the measurement and improvement of the quality and safety of patient care.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) The numbers of residents described in subparagraph (C) who completed their residency training at the end of such residency academic year and care for children within the borders of the service area of the hospital or within the borders of the State in which the hospital is located.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) describing the results of the program carried out under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) making recommendations for improvements to the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of payment for direct graduate medical education</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount determined under this subsection for payments to a children's hospital for direct graduate expenses relating to approved graduate medical residency training programs for a fiscal year is equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education, as determined under paragraph (2); and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:347 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the average number of full-time equivalent residents in the hospital's graduate approved medical residency training programs (as determined under section 1395ww(h)(4) of this title during the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education for a hospital for a fiscal year is an amount determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determination of hospital single per resident amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute for each hospital operating an approved graduate medical education program (regardless of whether or not it is a children's hospital) a single per resident amount equal to the average (weighted by number of full-time equivalent residents) of the primary care per resident amount and the non-primary care per resident amount computed under section 1395ww(h)(2) of this title for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1997.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination of wage and non-wage-related proportion of the single per resident amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall estimate the average proportion of the single per resident amounts computed under subparagraph (A) that is attributable to wages and wage-related costs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Standardizing per resident amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish a standardized per resident amount for each such hospital&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by dividing the single per resident amount computed under subparagraph (A) into a wage-related portion and a non-wage-related portion by applying the proportion determined under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by dividing the wage-related portion by the factor applied under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title for discharges occurring during fiscal year 1999 for the hospital's area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Determination of national average</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute a national average per resident amount equal to the average of the standardized per resident amounts computed under subparagraph (C) for such hospitals, with the amount for each hospital weighted by the average number of full-time equivalent residents at such hospital.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Application to individual hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute for each such hospital that is a children's hospital a per resident amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by dividing the national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (D) into a wage-related portion and a non-wage-related portion by applying the proportion determined under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by multiplying the wage-related portion by the factor applied under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title for discharges occurring during the preceding fiscal year for the hospital's area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Updating rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall update such per resident amount for each such children's hospital by the estimated percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers during the period beginning October 1997 and ending with the midpoint of the Federal fiscal year for which payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of payment for indirect medical education</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount determined under this subsection for payments to a children's hospital for indirect expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill patients and the additional costs associated with the teaching of residents for a fiscal year is equal to an amount determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account variations in case mix among children's hospitals and the ratio of the number of full-time equivalent residents in the hospitals&rsquo; approved graduate medical residency training programs to beds (but excluding beds or bassinets assigned to healthy newborn infants); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) assure that the aggregate of the payments for indirect expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill patients and the additional costs related to the teaching of residents under this section in a fiscal year are equal to the amount appropriated for such expenses for the fiscal year involved under subsection (f)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Making of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Interim payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall determine, before the beginning of each fiscal year involved for which payments may be made for a hospital under this section, the amounts of the payments for direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education for such fiscal year and shall (subject to paragraph (2)) make the payments of such amounts in 12 equal interim installments during such period. Such interim payments to each individual hospital shall be based on the number of residents reported in the hospital's most recently filed Medicare cost report prior to the application date for the Federal fiscal year for which the interim payment amounts are established. In the case of a hospital that does not report residents on a Medicare cost report, such interim <!-- PDFPage:348 -->payments shall be based on the number of residents trained during the hospital's most recently completed Medicare cost report filing period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall withhold up to 25 percent from each interim installment for direct and indirect graduate medical education paid under paragraph (1) as necessary to ensure a hospital will not be overpaid on an interim basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reconciliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Prior to the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine any changes to the number of residents reported by a hospital in the application of the hospital for the current fiscal year to determine the final amount payable to the hospital for the current fiscal year for both direct expense and indirect expense amounts. Based on such determination, the Secretary shall recoup any overpayments made and pay any balance due to the extent possible. The final amount so determined shall be considered a final intermediary determination for the purposes of section 1395<em>oo</em> of this title and shall be subject to administrative and judicial review under that section in the same manner as the amount of payment under section 1395ww(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#256e_1_target" name="256e_1">1</a></sup> of this title is subject to review under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization of appropriations</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reconciliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall determine any changes to the number of residents reported by a hospital in the application of the hospital for the current fiscal year to determine the final amount payable to the hospital for the current fiscal year for both direct expense and indirect expense amounts. Based on such determination, the Secretary shall recoup any overpayments made to pay any balance due to the extent possible.

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13546. Optimizing the Security of Biological Select Agents and Toxins in the United States</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13546, July 2, 2010, 75 F.R. 39439, provided:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:370 --><p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. It is the policy of the United States that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) A robust and productive scientific enterprise that utilizes biological select agents and toxins (BSAT) is essential to national security;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) BSAT shall be secured in a manner appropriate to their risk of misuse, theft, loss, and accidental release; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Security measures shall be taken in a coordinated manner that balances their efficacy with the need to minimize the adverse impact on the legitimate use of BSAT.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. (a) &ldquo;Select Agent Program&rdquo; (SAP) means the regulatory oversight and administrative activities conducted by the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture and the Attorney General to implement the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002 and the Agricultural Bioterrorism Protection Act of 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Select Agent Regulations&rdquo; (SAR) means the Federal regulations found in Part 73 of Title 42 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 331 of Title 7 of the Code of Federal Regulations, and Part 121 of Title 9 of the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Biological Select Agents and Toxins&rdquo; means biological agents and toxins with the potential to pose a severe threat to public health and safety, animal and plant health, or animal and plant products and whose possession, use, and transfer are regulated by the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Agriculture under the SAR.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Findings</em>. (a) The use of BSAT presents the risk that BSAT might be lost, stolen, or diverted for malicious purpose. The SAP exists to provide effective regulatory oversight of the possession, use, and transfer of BSAT that reduces the risk of their misuse or mishandling. The absence of clearly defined, risk-based security measures in the SAR/SAP has raised concern about the need for optimized security and for risk management.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In addition, variations in, and limited coordination of, individual executive departments&rsquo; and agencies&rsquo; oversight, security practices, and inspections have raised concerns that the cost and complexity of compliance for those who are registered to work with BSAT could discourage research or other legitimate activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Understanding that research and laboratory work on BSAT is essential to both public health and national security, it is in the interest of the United States to address these issues.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Risk-based Tiering of the Select Agent List</em>. To help ensure that BSAT are secured according to level of risk, the Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture shall, through their ongoing review of the biological Select Agents and Toxins List (&ldquo;Select Agent List&rdquo;) contained in regulations, and no later than 18 months from the date of this order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) designate a subset of the Select Agent List (Tier 1) that presents the greatest risk of deliberate misuse with most significant potential for mass casualties or devastating effects to the economy, critical infrastructure, or public confidence;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) explore options for graded protection of Tier 1 agents and toxins as described in subsection (a) of this section to permit tailored risk management practices based upon relevant contextual factors; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) consider reducing the overall number of agents and toxins on the Select Agent List.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Revision of Regulations, Rules, and Guidance to Accommodate a Tiered Select Agent List</em>. Consistent with section 4 of this order, I request that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture, no later than 15 months from the date of this order, propose amendments to their respective parts of the SAR that would establish security standards specific to Tier 1 agents and toxins.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Secretaries of Health and Human Services and Agriculture each, no later than 27 months from the date of this order, promulgate final rules and guidance that clearly articulate security actions for registrants who possess, use, or transfer Tier 1 agents and toxins.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Coordination of Federal Oversight for BSAT Security</em>. To ensure that the policies and practices used to secure BSAT are harmonized and that the related oversight activities of the Federal Government are coordinated, the heads of executive departments and agencies identified in section 7(a)(ii) of this order shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) no later than 6 months from the date of this order, develop and implement a plan for the coordination of BSAT security oversight that:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) articulates a mechanism for coordinated and reciprocal inspection of and harmonized administrative practices for facilities registered with the SAP;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) ensures consistent and timely identification and resolution of BSAT security and compliance issues;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) facilitates information sharing among departments and agencies regarding ongoing oversight and inspection activities; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) provides for comprehensive and effective Federal oversight of BSAT security; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) no later than 6 months from the issuance of final rules and guidance as described in section 5 of this order, and annually thereafter, review for inconsistent requirements and revise or rescind, as appropriate, any regulations, directives, guidance, or policies regarding BSAT security within their department or agency that exceed those in the updated SAR and guidance as described in section 5 of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Implementation</em>. (a) Establishment, Operation, and Functions of the Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) There is hereby established, within the Department of Health and Human Services for administrative purposes only, the Federal Experts Security Advisory Panel (Panel), which shall make technical and substantive recommendations on BSAT security concerning the SAP.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Surgeon General, with the approval of the Secretary, is authorized to make and enforce such regulations as in his judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession. For purposes of carrying out and enforcing such regulations, the Surgeon General may provide for such inspection, fumigation, disinfection, sanitation, pest extermination, destruction of animals or articles found to be so infected or contaminated as to be sources of dangerous infection to human beings, and other measures, as in his judgment may be necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Regulations prescribed under this section shall not provide for the apprehension, detention, or conditional release of individuals except for the purpose of preventing the introduction, transmission, or spread of such communicable diseases as may be specified from time to time in Executive orders of the President upon the recommendation of the Secretary, in consultation with the Surgeon General,<sup><a href="#264_1_target" name="264_1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application of regulations to persons entering from foreign countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (d) of this section, regulations prescribed under this section, insofar as they provide for the apprehension, detention, examination, or conditional release of individuals, shall be applicable only to individuals coming into a State or possession from a foreign country or a possession.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Apprehension and examination of persons reasonably believed to be infected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations prescribed under this section may provide for the apprehension and examination of any individual reasonably believed to be infected with a communicable disease in a qualifying stage and (A) to be moving or about to move from a State to another State; or (B) to be a probable source of infection to individuals who, while infected with such disease in a qualifying stage, will be moving from a State to another State. Such regulations may provide that if upon examination any such individual is found to be infected, he may be detained for such time and in such manner as may be reason<!-- PDFPage:393 -->ably necessary. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; includes, in addition to the several States, only the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualifying stage&rdquo;, with respect to a communicable disease, means that such disease&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is in a communicable stage; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is in a precommunicable stage, if the disease would be likely to cause a public health emergency if transmitted to other individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or section 266 of this title, or the regulations promulgated under such sections, may be construed as superseding any provision under State law (including regulations and including provisions established by political subdivisions of States), except to the extent that such a provision conflicts with an exercise of Federal authority under this section or section 266 of this title.</p>

The Surgeon General with the approval of the Secretary of Health and Human Services may prescribe regulations requiring the owner, agent, consignee, operator, or master or other person for whom the overtime services are performed to file a bond in such amounts and containing such conditions and with such sureties, or in lieu of a bond, to deposit money or obligations of the United States in such amount, as will assure the payment of charges under this subsection, which bond or deposit may cover one or more transactions or all transactions during a specified period: <em>Provided</em>, That no charges shall be made for services performed in connection with the inspection of (1) persons arriving by international highways, ferries, bridges, or tunnels, or the conveyances in which they arrive, or (2) persons arriving by aircraft or railroad trains, the operations of which are covered by published schedules, or the aircraft or trains in which they arrive, or (3) persons arriving by vessels operated between Canadian ports and ports on Puget Sound or operated on the Great Lakes and connecting waterways, the operations of which are covered by published schedules, or the vessels in which they arrive.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Every year, over 12,500 young people are diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Each year about 2,300 children and teenagers die from cancer.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) One in every 330 Americans develops cancer before age 20.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Some forms of childhood cancer have proven to be so resistant that even in spite of the great research strides made, most of those children die. Up to 75 percent of the children with cancer can now be cured.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The causes of most childhood cancers are not yet known.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Childhood cancers are mostly those of the white blood cells (leukemias), brain, bone, the lymphatic system, and tumors of the muscles, kidneys, and nervous system. Each of these behaves differently, but all are characterized by an uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal cells.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Eighty percent of the children who are diagnosed with cancer have disease which has already spread to distant sites in the body.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Asthma is a chronic condition requiring lifetime, ongoing medical intervention.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 1980, 6,700,000 Americans had asthma.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In 2001, 20,300,000 Americans had asthma; 6,300,000 children under age 18 had asthma.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The prevalence of asthma among African-American children was 40 percent greater than among Caucasian children, and more than 26 percent of all asthma deaths are in the African-American population.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In 2000, there were 1,800,000 asthma-related visits to emergency departments (more than 728,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In 2000, there were 465,000 asthma-related hospitalizations (214,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title V, &sect;501, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3023, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The health-related costs of intimate partner violence in the United States exceed $5,800,000,000 annually.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Thirty-seven percent of all women who sought care in hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In addition to injuries sustained during violent episodes, physical and psychological abuse is linked to a number of adverse physical and mental health effects. Women who have been abused are much more likely to suffer from chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended pregnancies, substance abuse and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Health plans spend an average of $1,775 more a year on abused women than on general enrollees.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Each year about 324,000 pregnant women in the United States are battered by the men in their lives. This battering leads to complications of pregnancy, including low weight gain, anemia, infections, and first and second trimester bleeding.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to be victims of homicide than to die of any other pregnancy-related cause, and evidence exists that a significant proportion of all female homicide victims are killed by their intimate partners.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit sexual assault crimes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Recent research suggests that women experiencing domestic violence significantly increase their safety-promoting behaviors over the short- and long-term when health care providers screen for, identify, and provide followup care and information to address the violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Currently, only about 10 percent of primary care physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during new patient visits and 9 percent routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during periodic checkups.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a 10-minute intervention that was proven highly effective in increasing the safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable research does not yet exist to support the effectiveness of screening men.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Seventy to 81 percent of the patients studied reported that they would like their healthcare providers to ask them privately about intimate partner violence.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title V, &sect;502, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3024, provided that: &ldquo;It is the purpose of this title [enacting this section, sections 294h and 13973 of this title, and provisions set out as a note above] to improve the health care system's response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking through the training and education of health care providers, developing comprehensive public health responses to violence against women and children, increasing the number of women properly screened, identified, and treated for lifetime exposure to violence, and expanding research on effective interventions in the health care setting.&rdquo;</p>
