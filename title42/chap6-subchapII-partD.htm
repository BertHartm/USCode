<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving applications made under section 254f of this title for the assignment of Corps members, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) give priority to any such application that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is made regarding the provision of primary health services to a health professional shortage area with the greatest such shortage, as determined in accordance with subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is made by an entity that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) serves a health professional shortage area described in subparagraph (A);</p>
<!-- PDFPage:205 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) coordinates the delivery of primary health services with related health and social services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) has a documented record of sound fiscal management; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) will experience a negative impact on its capacity to provide primary health services if a Corps member is not assigned to the entity;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with respect to the geographic area in which the health professional shortage area is located, take into consideration the willingness of individuals in the geographic area, and of the appropriate governmental agencies or health entities in the area, to assist and cooperate with the Corps in providing effective primary health services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) take into consideration comments of medical, osteopathic, dental, or other health professional societies whose members deliver services to the health professional shortage area, or if no such societies exist, comments of physicians, dentists, or other health professionals delivering services to the area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusive factors for determining greatest shortages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making a determination under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section of the health professional shortage areas with the greatest such shortages, the Secretary may consider only the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The ratio of available health manpower to the number of individuals in the area or population group involved, or served by the medical facility or other public facility involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Indicators of need as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The rate of low birthweight births.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The rate of infant mortality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The rate of poverty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Access to primary health services, taking into account the distance to such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of criteria for determining priorities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish criteria specifying the manner in which the Secretary makes a determination under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section of the health professional shortage areas with the greatest such shortages. Such criteria shall specify the manner in which the factors described in subsection (b) of this section are implemented regarding such a determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Publication of criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The criteria required in paragraph (1) shall be published in the Federal Register not later than July 1, 1991. Any revisions made in the criteria by the Secretary shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notifications regarding priorities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Preparation of list for applicable period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of carrying out paragraph (2), the Secretary shall prepare a list of health professional shortage areas that are receiving priority under subsection (a)(1) of this section in the assignment of Corps members for the period applicable under subsection (f) of this section. Such list&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall include a specification, for each such health professional shortage area, of the entities for which the Secretary has provided an authorization to receive assignments of Corps members in the event that Corps members are available for the assignments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall, of the entities for which an authorization described in subparagraph (A) has been provided, specify&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the entities provided such an authorization for the assignment of Corps members who are participating in the Loan Repayment Program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the entities provided such an authorization for the assignment of Corps members who have become Corps members other than pursuant to contractual obligations under the Scholarship or Loan Repayment Programs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary may set forth such specifications by medical specialty.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notification of affected parties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Not later than 30 days after the preparation of each list under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall notify entities specified for purposes of subparagraph (A) of such paragraph of the fact that the entities have been provided an authorization to receive assignments of Corps members in the event that Corps members are available for the assignments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of individuals with respect to whom a period of obligated service under the Scholarship Program will begin during the period under subsection (f) of this section for which a list under paragraph (1) is prepared, the Secretary shall, not later than 30 days after the preparation of each such list, provide to such individuals the names of each of the entities specified for purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(i) that is appropriate to the medical specialty of the individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Revisions in list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary makes a revision in a list under paragraph (1) during the period under subsection (f) of this section to which the list is applicable, and the revision alters the status of an entity with respect to the list, the Secretary shall notify the entity of the effect on the entity of the revision. Such notification shall be provided not later than 30 days after the date on which the revision is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on number of entities offered as assignment choices in Scholarship Program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Determination of available Corps members</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Availability of 500 or fewer members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the number of participants for purposes of paragraph (1) is less than 500, the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:206 -->shall limit the number of entities specified under subsection (d)(1)(B)(i) of this section to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 500 such entities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a number of such entities constituting 300 percent of the number of such participants available for assignment under section 254f of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Availability of more than 500 members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the number of participants for purposes of paragraph (1) is equal to or greater than 500, the Secretary shall determine the number of entities to be specified under subsection (d)(1)(B)(i) of this section, subject to ensuring that assignments of such participants are made to 500 entities that serve health professional shortage areas that have chronic difficulty in recruiting and retaining health professionals to provide primary health services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Adjustment in base number</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The number 500, as used for purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), may by regulation be adjusted by the Secretary to a greater or a lesser number.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Applicable period regarding priorities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to determinations under subsection (a)(1) of this section of the applications that are to be given priority regarding the assignment of Corps members, the Secretary shall make such a determination not less than once each fiscal year. The first determination shall be made not later than July 1 of the year preceding the year in which the period of obligated service begins. If the Secretary revises the determination before July 1 of the following year, the revised determination shall be applicable with respect to assignments of Corps members made during the period beginning on the date of the issuance of the revised determination and ending on July 1 of such year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Date certain for preparation of notification list</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the entity shall be responsible for charging, in accordance with subsection (d) of this section, for health services provided by Corps members assigned to the entity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the entity shall take such action as may be reasonable for the collection of payments for such health services, including, if a Federal agency, an agency of a State or local government, or other third party would be responsible for all or part of the cost of such health services if it had not been provided by Corps members under this subpart, the collection, on a fee-for-service or other basis, from such agency or third party, the portion of such cost for which it would be so responsible (and in determining the amount of such cost which such agency or third party would be responsible, the health services provided by Corps members shall be considered as being provided by private practitioners);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the entity, if not a small health center, shall pay to the United States, as prescribed by the Secretary in each calendar quarter (or other period as may be specified in the agreement) during which any Corps member is assigned to such entity, the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount calculated by the Secretary to reflect the average salary (including amounts paid in accordance with section 254d(d) of this title) and allowances of comparable Corps members for a calendar quarter (or other period);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that portion of an amount calculated by the Secretary to reflect the average amount paid under the Scholarship Program or the Loan Repayment Program to or on behalf of comparable Corps members that bears the same ratio to the calculated amount as the number of days of service provided by the member during that quarter (or other period) bears to the number of days in his period of obligated service under the Scholarship Program or the Loan Repayment Program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if such entity received a loan under section 254h(c) of this title or a grant under section 254f(d)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#254g_1_target" name="254g_1">1</a></sup> of this title, an amount which bears the same ratio to the amount of such loan or grant as the number of days in such quarter (or other period) during which any Corps members were assigned to the entity bears to the number of days in the assignment period after such entity received such loan or grant;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the entity, if a small health center, shall pay to the United States, in each calendar quarter (or other period as may be specified in <!-- PDFPage:207 -->the agreement) during which any Corps member is assigned to such entity, an amount determined by the Secretary in accordance with subsection (f) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may waive in whole or in part, on a prospective or retrospective basis, the application of the requirement of subsection (a)(3) of this section for any entity which is not a small health center and which is located in a health professional shortage area in which a significant percentage of the individuals are elderly, living in poverty, or have other characteristics which indicate an inability to repay, in whole or in part, the amounts required in subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event that the Secretary grants a waiver under paragraph (1) or (2), and does not, pursuant to paragraph (5), require payment by the entity in the amount described in subsection (f)(1) of this section, the entity shall be required to use the total amount of funds collected by such entity in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section for the improvement of the capability of such entity to deliver health services to the individuals in, or served by, the health professional shortage area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In determining whether to grant a waiver under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary shall not discriminate against a public entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) If the Secretary determines that an entity which is not a small health center is eligible for a waiver under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary may waive the application of subsection (a)(3) of this section for such entity and require such entity to make payment in an amount equal to the amount described in subsection (f)(1) of this section that would be payable by such entity if such entity were a small health center.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may waive in whole or in part, on a prospective or retrospective basis, the application of the requirement of subparagraph (A) for any entity if the Secretary determines that the entity is financially unable to meet such requirement or that compliance with such requirement would unreasonably limit the ability of the entity to provide for the adequate support of the provision of health services by Corps members. Funds which would be paid to the United States but for a waiver under this subparagraph shall be used by an entity to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) expand or improve its provision of health services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) increase the number of individuals served;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) renovate or modernize facilities for its provision of health services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) improve the administration of its health service programs; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Charge for services; reduced rate; no charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who receives health services provided by a Corps member under this subpart shall be charged for such services on a fee-for-service or other basis, at a rate approved by the Secretary, pursuant to regulations. Such rate shall be computed in such a way as to permit the recovery of the value of such services, except that if such person is determined under regulations of the Secretary to be unable to pay such charge, the Secretary shall provide for the furnishing of such services at a reduced rate or without charge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Deposit of funds in Treasury as miscellaneous receipts; appropriations unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds received by the Secretary under an agreement entered into under this section shall be deposited in the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts and shall be disregarded in determining the amounts of appropriations to be requested and the amounts to be made available from appropriations made under section 254k of this title to carry out sections 254d through 254h and section 254j of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Small health centers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An entity which is a small health center shall pay to the United States, as prescribed by the Secretary in each calendar quarter (or other period as may be specified in the agreement) during which any Corps member is assigned to such entity, an amount equal to the amount (prorated for a calendar quarter or other period) by which the revenues that the center may reasonably expect to receive during an annual period for the provision of health services exceeds the costs that the center may reasonably expect to incur in the provision of such services, except that the amount that an entity shall pay to the United States under this paragraph shall not exceed the amount such entity would pay to the United States under paragraph (3) of subsection (a) of this section if such paragraph applied to such entity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) To determine for purposes of paragraph (1) the revenues and costs which an entity that is a small health center may reasonably be expected to receive and incur in an annual period for the provision of health services, the entity <!-- PDFPage:208 -->shall submit to the Secretary before the beginning of such period a proposed budget which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) describes the primary and supplemental health services (as defined in section 254c of this title) which are needed by the area the entity serves in such period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) states the revenues and costs which the entity expects to receive and incur in providing such health services in such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) From the submission under subparagraph (A) and other information available to the Secretary, the Secretary shall determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the primary and supplemental health services (as defined in section 254c of this title) needed in the area the entity serves;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the fees, premiums, third party reimbursements, and other revenues the entity making the submission may reasonably expect to receive from the provision of such services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the costs which the entity may reasonably expect to incur in providing such services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The revenues and costs determined by the Secretary shall be the revenues and costs used in making the determination under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) A determination under subparagraph (B) regarding the revenues and costs of an entity in an annual period shall be made by the Secretary utilizing criteria specific to the entity and shall be made without regard to whether the entity is making progress toward collecting sufficient revenues to provide an adequate level of primary health services without the assignment of Corps members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In making a determination referred to in clause (i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the Secretary may consider whether the proposed budget submitted under subparagraph (A) provides a reasonable estimate regarding the revenues and costs of the entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) may not consider the reasonableness of the amount of revenues collected, or the amount of costs incurred by the entity, except to the extent necessary to ensure that the entity is operating in good faith and is operating efficiently with respect to fiscal matters within the control of the entity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) A determination of whether an entity is eligible for a waiver under paragraph (3) shall be made by the Secretary without regard to the revenues and costs determined by the Secretary under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) A determination of whether an entity is a small health center shall be made by the Secretary without regard to the revenues and costs determined by the Secretary under subparagraph (B).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Means of delivery of services; cooperation with other health care providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing health services in a health professional shortage area, Corps members shall utilize the techniques, facilities, and organizational forms most appropriate for the area, population group, medical facility, or other public facility, and shall, to the maximum extent feasible, provide such services (1) to all individuals in, or served by, such health professional shortage area regardless of their ability to pay for the services, and (2) in a manner which is cooperative with other health care providers serving such health professional shortage area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Utilization of existing health facilities; lease, acquisition, and use of equipment and supplies; permanent and temporary professional services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may (A) to the maximum extent feasible make such arrangements as he determines necessary to enable Corps members to utilize the health facilities in or serving the health professional shortage area in providing health services; (B) make such arrangements as he determines are necessary for the use of equipment and supplies of the Service and for the lease or acquisition of other equipment and supplies; and (C) secure the permanent or temporary services of physicians, dentists, nurses, administrators, and other health personnel. If there are no health facilities in or serving such area, the Secretary may arrange to have Corps members provide health services in the nearest health facilities of the Service or may lease or otherwise provide facilities in or serving such area for the provision of health services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the individuals in or served by a health professional shortage area are being served (as determined under regulations of the Secretary) by a hospital or other health care delivery facility of the Service, the Secretary may, in addition to such other arrangements as he may make under paragraph (1), arrange for the utilization of such hospital or facility by Corps members in providing health services, but only to the extent that such utilization will not impair the delivery of health services and treatment through such hospital or facility to individuals who are entitled to health services and treatment through such hospital or facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Loan; purposes; limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make one loan to any entity with an approved application under section 254f of this title to assist such entity in meeting the costs of (1) establishing medical, dental, or other health profession practices, including the development of medical practice management systems; (2) acquiring equipment for use in providing health services; and (3) renovating buildings to establish health facilities. No loan may be made under this subsection unless an application therefor is submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary. The amount of any such loan shall be determined by the Secretary, except that no such loan may exceed $50,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Property and equipment disposal; fair market value; sale at less than full market value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the expiration of the assignment of all Corps members to a health professional shortage area, the Secretary may (notwithstanding any other provision of law) sell, to any appropriate local entity, equipment and other property of the United States utilized by such members in providing health services. Sales made under this subsection shall be made at the fair market value (as determined by the Secretary) of the equipment or such other property; except that the Secretary may make such sales for a lesser value to an appropriate local entity, if he determines that the entity is financially unable to pay the full market value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Admitting privileges denied to Corps member by hospital; notice and hearing; denial of Federal funds for violation; &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) It shall be unlawful for any hospital to deny an authorized Corps member admitting privileges when such Corps member otherwise meets the professional qualifications established <!-- PDFPage:210 -->by the hospital for granting such privileges and agrees to abide by the published bylaws of the hospital and the published bylaws, rules, and regulations of its medical staff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any hospital which is found by the Secretary, after notice and an opportunity for a hearing on the record, to have violated this subsection shall upon such finding cease, for a period to be determined by the Secretary, to receive and to be eligible to receive any Federal funds under this chapter or under titles XVIII or XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq., 1396 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; includes a State or local public hospital, a private profit hospital, a private nonprofit hospital, a general or special hospital, and any other type of hospital (excluding a hospital owned or operated by an agency of the Federal Government), and any related facilities.</p>
