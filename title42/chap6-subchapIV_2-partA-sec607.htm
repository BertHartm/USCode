<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; shall, notwithstanding section 606(a) of this title, include a needy child who meets the requirements of section 606(a)(2) of this title, who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the unemployment (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) of the parent who is the principal earner, and who is living with any of the relatives specified in section 606(a)(1) of this title in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his (or their) own home.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements of State plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In providing for the provision of aid to families with dependent children under the State's plan approved under section 602 of this title, in the case of families that include dependent children within the meaning of subsection (a) of this section, as required by section 602(a)(41) of this title, the State's plan&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such parent has not without good cause, within such period (of not less than 30 days) as may be prescribed by the Secretary, refused a bona fide offer of employment or training for employment, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1214 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii)(I) such parent has 6 or more quarters of work (as defined in subsection (d)(1) of this section), no more than 4 of which may be quarters of work defined in subsection (d)(1)(B) of this section, in any 13-calendar-quarter period ending within one year prior to the application for such aid or (II) such parent received unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States, or such parent was qualified (within the meaning of subsection (d)(3) of this section) for unemployment compensation under the unemployment compensation law of the State, within one year prior to the application for such aid; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) for such assurances as will satisfy the Secretary that unemployed parents of dependent children as defined in subsection (a) of this section will participate or apply for participation in a program under part F of this subchapter (unless the program is not available in the area where the parent is living) within 30 days after receipt of aid with respect to such children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) for entering into cooperative arrangements with the State agency responsible for administering or supervising the administration of vocational education in the State, designed to assure maximum utilization of available public vocational education services and facilities in the State in order to encourage the retraining of individuals capable of being retrained;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) for the denial of aid to families with dependent children to any child or relative specified in subsection (a) of this section with respect to any week for which such child's parent described in subparagraph (A)(i) qualifies for unemployment compensation under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States, but refuses to apply for or accept such unemployment compensation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) for the reduction of the aid to families with dependent children otherwise payable to any child or relative specified in subsection (a) of this section by the amount of any unemployment compensation that such child's parent described in subparagraph (A)(i) receives under an unemployment compensation law of a State or of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) that, if and for so long as the child's parent described in subparagraph (A)(i), unless meeting a condition of section 602(a)(19)(C) of this title, is, without good cause, not participating (or available for participation) in a program under part F of this subchapter, or if exempt under such section by reason of clause (vii) thereof or because there has not been established or provided under part F of this subchapter a program in which such parent can effectively participate, is not registered with the public employment offices in the State, the needs of such parent shall not be taken into account in determining the need of such parent's family under section 602(a)(7) of this title, and the needs of such parent's spouse shall not be so taken into account unless such spouse is participating in such a program, or if not participating solely by reason of section 602(a)(19)(C)(vii) of this title or because there has not been established or provided under part F of this subchapter a program in which such spouse can effectively participate, is registered with the public employment offices of the State; and if neither parents&rsquo;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#607_1_target" name="607_1">1</a></sup> needs are so taken into account, the payment provisions of section 602(a)(19)(G)(i)(I) of this title shall apply.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In carrying out the program under this section, a State may design its program to reflect the individual needs of the State and to emphasize education, training, and employment services for unemployed parents and their spouses who are eligible for aid to families with dependent children by reason of this section, to the extent provided under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to clauses (ii) and (iii), with respect to the requirement under section 602(a)(41) of this title, a State may, at its option, limit the number of months with respect to which a family receives aid to families with dependent children to the extent determined appropriate by the State for the operation of its program under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) A State may not limit the number of months under clause (i) for which a family may receive aid to families with dependent children unless it provides in its plan assurances to the Secretary that it has a program (that meets such requirements as the Secretary may in regulation prescribe) for providing education, training, and employment services (including any activity authorized under section 602(a)(19) of this title or under part F of this subchapter) in order to assist parents of children described in subsection (a) of this section in preparing for and obtaining employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) In exercising the option under clause (i), a State plan may not provide for the denial of aid to families with dependent children to a family otherwise eligible for such aid for any month unless the family has received such aid (on the basis of the unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner) in at least 6 of the preceding 12 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) Any family that is otherwise eligible for aid to families with dependent children that does not receive such aid in any month solely by reason of the State exercising the option under clause (i) shall be deemed, for purposes of determining the period under paragraph (1)(A)(iii)(I), to be receiving such aid in such month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Each State which, on September 26, 1988, has a program in effect under this section shall continue to operate such program without a time limitation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) With respect to the participation in the program under section 602(a)(19) of this title and part F of this subchapter of a family eligible for aid to families with dependent children by reason of this section, a State may, at its option&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) except as otherwise provided in such section and such part, require that any parent participating in such program engage in pro<!-- PDFPage:1215 -->gram activities for up to 40 hours per week; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) provide for the payment of aid to families with dependent children at regular intervals of no greater than one month but after the performance of assigned program activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exclusion of expenditures under this section from aid to families with dependent children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, expenditures pursuant to this section shall be excluded from aid to families with dependent children (A) where such expenditures are made under the plan with respect to any dependent child as defined in subsection (a) of this section, (i) for any part of the 30-day period referred to in subsection (b)(1)(A)(i) of this section, or (ii) for any period prior to the time when the parent satisfies subsection (b)(1)(A)(ii) of this section, and (B) if, and for as long as, no action is taken (after the 30-day period referred to in subsection (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section), under the program therein specified, to undertake appropriate steps directed toward the participation of such parent in a program under part F of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Quarter of work; calendar quarter; eligibility for State unemployment compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;quarter of work&rdquo; with respect to any individual means (A) a calendar quarter in which such individual received earned income of not less than $50 (or which is a &ldquo;quarter of coverage&rdquo; as defined in section 413(a)(2) of this title), or in which such individual participated in the program under section 602(a)(19) of this title and part F of this subchapter, (B) at the option of the State, a calendar quarter in which such individual attended, full-time, an elementary school, a secondary school, or a vocational or technical training course (approved by the Secretary) that is designed to prepare the individual for gainful employment, or in which such individual participated in an education or training program established under the Job Training Partnership Act [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.], and (C) a calendar quarter ending before October 1990 in which such individual participated in a community work experience program under section 609 of this title (as in effect for a State immediately before the effective date for that State of the amendments made by title II of the Family Support Act of 1988) or the work incentive program established under part C of this subchapter (as in effect for a State immediately before such effective date);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;calendar quarter&rdquo; means a period of 3 consecutive calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an individual shall, for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(A)(iii) of this section, be deemed qualified for unemployment compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) he would have been eligible to receive such unemployment compensation upon filing application, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) he performed work not covered under such law and such work, if it had been covered, would (together with any covered work he performed) have made him eligible to receive such unemployment compensation upon filing application; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the phrase &ldquo;whichever of such child's parents is the principal earner&rdquo;, in the case of any child, means whichever parent, in a home in which both parents of such child are living, earned the greater amount of income in the 24-month period the last month of which immediately precedes the month in which an application is filed for aid under this part on the basis of the unemployment of a parent, for each consecutive month for which the family receives such aid on that basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding section 602(a)(1) of this title, a State that chooses to exercise the option provided under paragraph (1)(B) may provide that the definition of calendar quarter under such option apply in one or more political subdivisions of the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Agreement with States for simplification of procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Secretary of Labor shall jointly enter into an agreement with each State which is able and willing to do so for the purpose of (1) simplifying the procedures to be followed by unemployed parents and other unemployed persons in such State in participating in a program under part F of this subchapter and in registering with public employment offices (under this section and otherwise) or in connection with applications for unemployment compensation, by reducing the number of locations or agencies where such persons must go in order to participate in or register for such programs and in connection with such applications, and (2) providing where possible for a single registration satisfying this section and the requirements of both part F of this subchapter and the applicable unemployment compensation laws.</p>
