<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Physician</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;physician&rdquo; includes, except as the Secretary may otherwise provide, any individual who furnishes services for which payment may be made as physicians&rsquo; services and has the medical training or experience to fulfill the physician's role described in subparagraph (A)(i).</p>

Such spending targets shall be determined on a per capita basis. Such spending targets shall include a risk corridor that takes into account normal variation in expenditures for items and services covered under parts A and B furnished to such beneficiaries with the size of the corridor being related to the number of applicable beneficiaries furnished services by each independence at home medical practice.
