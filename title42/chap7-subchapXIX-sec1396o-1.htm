<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to encourage beneficiaries to use drugs (in this subsection referred to as &ldquo;preferred drugs&rdquo;) identified by the State as the most (or more) cost effective prescription drugs within a class of drugs (as defined by the State), with respect to one or more groups of beneficiaries specified by the State, subject to paragraph (2), the State may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide cost sharing (instead of the level of cost sharing otherwise permitted under section 1396<em>o</em> of this title, but subject to paragraphs (2) and (3)) with respect to drugs that are not preferred drugs within a class; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) waive or reduce the cost sharing otherwise applicable for preferred drugs within such class and shall not apply any such cost sharing for such preferred drugs for individuals for whom cost sharing may not be imposed under subsection (a) due to the application of subsection (b)(3)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) By income group</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in the case of an individual whose family income does not exceed 150 percent of the poverty line applicable to a family of the size involved, the amount of nominal cost sharing (as otherwise determined under section 1396<em>o</em> of this title); or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out paragraph (1), a State shall provide for the application of cost sharing levels applicable to a preferred drug in the case of a drug that is not a preferred drug if the prescribing physician determines that the preferred drug for treatment of the same condition either would not be as effective for the individual or would have adverse effects for the individual or both.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Exclusion authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a State from excluding specified drugs or classes of drugs from the application of paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforceability of premiums and other cost sharing</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1396<em>o</em>(c)(3) of this title and section 1396a(a)(10)(B) of this title, a State may, at its option, condition the provision of medical assistance for an individual upon prepayment of a premium authorized to be imposed under this section, or may terminate eligibility for such medical assistance on the basis of failure to pay such a premium but shall not terminate eligibility of an individual for medical assistance under this subchapter on the basis of failure to pay any such premium until such failure continues for a period of not less than 60 days. A State may apply the previous sentence for some or all groups of beneficiaries as specified by the State and may waive payment of any such premium in any case where the State determines that requiring such payment would create an undue hardship.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cost sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1396<em>o</em>(e) of this title or any other provision of law, a State may permit a provider participating under the State plan to require, as a condition for the provision of care, items, or services to an individual entitled to medical assistance under this subchapter for such care, items, or services, the payment of any cost sharing authorized to be imposed under this section with respect to such care, items, or services. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preventing a provider from reducing or waiving the application of such cost sharing on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State option for permitting hospitals to impose cost sharing for non-emergency care furnished in an emergency department</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding section 1396<em>o</em> of this title and section 1396a(a)(1) of this title or the previous provisions of this section, but subject to the limitations of paragraph (2), a State may, by amendment to its State plan under this subchapter, permit a hospital to impose cost sharing for non-emergency services furnished <!-- PDFPage:3481 -->to an individual (within one or more groups of individuals specified by the State) in the hospital emergency department under this subsection if the following conditions are met:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Access to non-emergency room provider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The individual has actually available and accessible (as such terms are applied by the Secretary under section 1396<em>o</em>(b)(3) of this title) an alternate non-emergency services provider with respect to such services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The hospital must inform the beneficiary after receiving an appropriate medical screening examination under section 1395dd of this title and after a determination has been made that the individual does not have an emergency medical condition, but before providing the non-emergency services, of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The hospital may require the payment of the State specified cost sharing before the service can be provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The name and location of an alternate non-emergency services provider (described in subparagraph (A)) that is actually available and accessible (as described in such subparagraph).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The fact that such alternate provider can provide the services without the imposition of cost sharing described in clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) The hospital provides a referral to coordinate scheduling of this treatment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a State from applying (or waiving) cost sharing otherwise permissible under this section to services described in clause (iii).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Individuals with family income between 100 and 150 percent of the poverty line</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an individual described in subsection (b)(1) who is not described in subparagraph (B), the cost sharing imposed under this subsection may not exceed twice the amount determined to be nominal under section 1396<em>o</em> of this title, subject to the percent of income limitation otherwise applicable under subsection (b)(1)(B)(ii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application to exempt populations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an individual described in subsection (a)(2)(A) or who is not subject to cost sharing under subsection (b)(3)(B) with respect to non-emergency services described in paragraph (1), a State may impose cost sharing under paragraph (1) for care in an amount that does not exceed a nominal amount (as otherwise determined under section 1396<em>o</em> of this title) so long as no cost sharing is imposed to receive such care through an outpatient department or other alternative health care provider in the geographic area of the hospital emergency department involved.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Continued application of aggregate cap; relation to other cost sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to the limitations imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B), any cost sharing under paragraph (1) is subject to the aggregate cap on cost sharing applied under subsection (a)(2)(B) or under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b), as the case may be. Cost sharing imposed for services under this subsection shall be instead of any cost sharing that may be imposed for such services under subsection (a) or section 1396<em>o</em> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to limit a hospital's obligations with respect to screening and stabilizing treatment of an emergency medical condition under section 1395dd of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to modify any obligations under either State or Federal standards relating to the application of a prudent-layperson standard with respect to payment or coverage of emergency services by any managed care organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Non-emergency services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;non-emergency services&rdquo; means any care or services furnished in an emergency department of a hospital that do not constitute an appropriate medical screening examination or stabilizing examination and treatment required to be provided by the hospital under section 1395dd of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Alternate non-emergency services provider</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;alternative non-emergency services provider&rdquo; means, with respect to non-emergency services for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition, a health care provider, such as a physician's office, health care clinic, community health center, hospital outpatient department, or similar health care provider, that can provide clinically appropriate services for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition contemporaneously with the provision of the non-emergency services that would be provided in an emergency department of a hospital for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition, and that is participating in the program under this subchapter.</p>
