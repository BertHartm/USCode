<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970, prepared in accordance with chapter 9 of title 5 of the United States Code and providing for an Environmental Protection Agency. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in a more extended accompanying message.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to section 901(a)(1), &ldquo;to promote the better execution of the laws, the more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and the expeditious administration of the public business;&rdquo; and section 901(a)(3), &ldquo;to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganizations provided for in the plan make necessary the appointment and compensation of new officers as specified in section 1 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are comparable to those fixed for other officers in the executive branch who have similar responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">Section 907 of title 5 of the United States Code will operate to preserve administrative proceedings, including any public hearing proceedings, related to the transferred functions, which are pending immediately prior to the taking effect of the reorganization plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">The reorganization plan should result in more efficient operation of the Government. It is not practical, however, to itemize or aggregate the exact expenditure reductions which will result from this action.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>The White House</cap-smallcap>, July 9, 1970.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">As concern with the condition of our physical environment has intensified, it has become increasingly clear that we need to know more about the total environment&mdash;land, water and air. It also has become increasingly clear that only by reorganizing our Federal efforts can we develop that knowledge, and effectively ensure the protection, development and enhancement of the total environment itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Government's environmentally-related activities have grown up piecemeal over the years. The time has come to organize them rationally and systematically. As a major step in this direction, I am transmitting today two reorganization plans: one to establish an Environmental Protection Agency, and one to establish, within the Department of Commerce, a National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)</h4>
<p class="note-body">Our national government today is not structured to make a coordinated attack on the pollutants which debase the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the land that grows our food. Indeed, the present governmental structure for dealing with environmental pollution often defies effective and concerted action.</p>
<p class="note-body">Despite its complexity, for pollution control purposes the environment must be perceived as a single, interrelated system. Present assignments of departmental responsibilities do not reflect this interrelatedness.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many agency missions, for example, are designed primarily along media lines&mdash;air, water, and land. Yet the sources of air, water, and land pollution are interrelated and often interchangeable. A single source may pollute the air with smoke and chemicals, the land with solid wastes, and a river or lake with chemical and other wastes. Control of the air pollution may produce more solid wastes, which then pollute the land or water. Control of the water-polluting effluent may convert it into solid wastes, which must be disposed of on land.</p>
<p class="note-body">Similarly, some pollutants&mdash;chemicals, radiation, pesticides&mdash;appear in all media. Successful control of them at present requires the coordinated efforts of a variety of separate agencies and departments. The results are not always successful.</p>
<p class="note-body">A far more effective approach to pollution control would:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;identify pollutants.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;trace them through the entire ecological chain, observing and recording changes in form as they occur.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Determine the total exposure of man his environment.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Examine interactions among forms of pollution.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Identify where in the ecological chain interdiction would be most appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">In organizational terms, this requires pulling together into one agency a variety of research, monitoring, standard-setting and enforcement activities now scattered through several departments and agencies. It also requires that the new agency include sufficient support elements&mdash;in research and in aids to State and local anti-pollution programs, for example&mdash;to give it the needed strength and potential for carrying out its mission. The new agency would also, of course, draw upon the results of research conducted by other agencies.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">components of the epa</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under the terms of Reorganization Plan No. 3, the following would be moved to the new Environmental Protection Agency:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The functions carried out by the Federal Water Quality Administration (from the Department of the Interior).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Functions with respect to pesticides studies now vested in the Department of the Interior.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The functions carried out by the National Air Pollution Control Administration (from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The functions carried out by the Bureau of Solid Waste Management and the Bureau of Water Hygiene, and portions of the functions carried out by the Bureau of Radiological Health of the Environmental Control Administration (from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Certain functions with respect to pesticides carried out by the Food and Drug Administration (from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Authority to perform studies relating to ecological systems now vested in the Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Certain functions respecting radiation criteria and standards now vested in the Atomic Energy Commission and the Federal Radiation Council.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Functions respecting pesticides registration and related activities now carried out by the Agricultural <!-- PDFPage:3780 -->Research Service (from the Department of Agriculture).</p>
<p class="note-body">With its broad mandate, EPA would also develop competence in areas of environmental protection that have not previously been given enough attention, such, for example, as the problem of noise, and it would provide an organization to which new programs in these areas could be added.</p>
<p class="note-body">In brief, these are the principal functions to be transferred:</p>
<p class="note-body">Federal Water Quality Administration.&mdash;Charged with the control of pollutants which impair water quality, it is broadly concerned with the impact of degraded water quality. It performs a wide variety of functions, including research, standard-setting and enforcement, and provides construction grants and technical assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Certain pesticides research authority from the Department of the Interior.&mdash;Authority for research on the effects of pesticides on fish and wildlife would be provided to the EPA through transfer of the specialized research authority of the pesticides act enacted in 1958. Interior would retain its responsibility to do research on all factors affecting fish and wildlife. Under this provision, only one laboratory would be transferred to the EPA&mdash;the Gulf Breeze Biological Laboratory of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries. The EPA would work closely with the fish and wildlife laboratories remaining with the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife.</p>
<p class="note-body">National Air Pollution Control Administration.&mdash;As the principal Federal agency concerned with air pollution, it conducts research on the effects of air pollution, operates a monitoring network, and promulgates criteria which serve as the basis for setting air quality standards. Its regulatory functions are similar to those of the Federal Water Quality Administration. NAPCA is responsible for administering the Clean Air Act, which involves designating air quality regions, approving State standards and providing financial and technical assistance to State Control agencies to enable them to comply with the Act's provisions. It also sets and enforces Federal automotive emission standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">Elements of the Environmental Control Administration.&mdash;ECA is the focal point within HEW for evaluation and control of a broad range of environmental health problems, including water quality, solid wastes, and radiation. Programs in the ECA involve research, development of criteria and standards, and the administration of planning and demonstration grants. From the ECA, the activities of the Bureaus of Water Hygiene and Solid Waste Management and portions of the activities of the Bureau of Radiological Health would be transferred. Other functions of the ECA including those related to the regulation of radiation from consumer products and occupational safety and health would remain in HEW.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pesticides research and standard-setting programs of the Food and Drug Administration.&mdash;FDA's pesticides program consists of setting and enforcing standards which limit pesticide residues in food. EPA would have the authority to set pesticide standards and to monitor compliance with them, as well as to conduct related research. However, as an integral part of its food protection activities, FDA would retain its authority to remove from the market food with excess pesticide residues.</p>
<p class="note-body">General ecological research from the Council on Environmental Quality.&mdash;This authority to perform studies and research relating to ecological systems would be in addition to EPA's other specific research authorities, and it would help EPA to measure the impact of pollutants. The Council on Environmental Quality would retain its authority to conduct studies and research relating to environmental quality.</p>
<p class="note-body">Environmental radiation standards programs.&mdash;The Atomic Energy Commission is now responsible for establishing environmental radiation standards and emission limits for radioactivity. Those standards have been based largely on broad guidelines recommended by the Federal Radiation Council. The Atomic Energy Commission's authority to set standards for the protection of the general environment from radioactive material would be transferred to the Environmental Protection Agency. The functions of the Federal Radiation Council would also be transferred. AEC would retain responsibility for the implementation and enforcement of radiation standards through its licensing authority.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pesticides registration program of the Agricultural Research Service.&mdash;The Department of Agriculture is currently responsible for several distinct functions related to pesticides use. It conducts research on the efficacy of various pesticides as related to other pest control methods and on the effects of pesticides on non-target plants, livestock, and poultry. It registers pesticides, monitors their persistence and carries out an educational program on pesticide use through the extension service. It conducts extensive pest control programs which utilize pesticides.</p>
<p class="note-body">By transferring the Department of Agriculture's pesticides registration and monitoring function to the EPA and merging it with the pesticides programs being transferred from HEW and Interior, the new agency would be given a broad capability for control over the introduction of pesticides into the environment.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Agriculture would continue to conduct research on the effectiveness of pesticides. The Department would furnish this information to the EPA, which would have the responsibility for actually licensing pesticides for use after considering environmental and health effects. Thus the new agency would be able to make use of the expertise of the Department.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">advantages of reorganization</h4>
<p class="note-body">This reorganization would permit response to environmental problems in a manner beyond the previous capability of our pollution control programs. The EPA would have the capacity to do research on important pollutants irrespective of the media in which they appear, and on the impact of these pollutants on the total environment. Both by itself and together with other agencies, the EPA would monitor the condition of the environment&mdash;biological as well as physical. With these data, the EPA would be able to establish quantitative &ldquo;environmental baselines&rdquo;&mdash;critical if we are to measure adequately the success or failure of our pollution abatement efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body">As no disjointed array of separate programs can, the EPA would be able&mdash;in concert with the States&mdash;to set and enforce standards for air and water quality and for individual pollutants. This consolidation of pollution control authorities would help assure that we do not create new environmental problems in the process of controlling existing ones. Industries seeking to minimize the adverse impact of their activities on the environment would be assured of consistent standards covering the full range of their waste disposal problems. As the States develop and expand their own pollution control programs, they would be able to look to one agency to support their efforts with financial and technical assistance and training.</p>
<p class="note-body">In proposing that the Environmental Protection Agency be set up as a separate new agency, I am making an exception to one of my own principles: that, as a matter of effective and orderly administration, additional new independent agencies normally should not be created. In this case, however, the arguments against placing environmental protection activities under the jurisdiction of one or another of the existing departments and agencies are compelling.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the first place, almost every part of government is concerned with the environment in some way, and affects it in some way. Yet each department also has its own primary mission&mdash;such as resource development, transportation, health, defense, urban growth or agriculture&mdash;which necessarily affects its own view of environmental questions.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the second place, if the critical standard-setting functions were centralized within any one existing department, it would require that department constantly to make decisions affecting other departments&mdash;in <!-- PDFPage:3781 -->which, whether fairly or unfairly, its own objectivity as an impartial arbiter could be called into question.</p>
<p class="note-body">Because environmental protection cuts across so many jurisdictions, and because arresting environmental deterioration is of great importance to the quality of life in our country and the world, I believe that in this case a strong, independent agency is needed. That agency would, of course, work closely with and draw upon the expertise and assistance of other agencies having experience in the environmental area.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">roles and functions of epa</h4>
<p class="note-body">The principal roles and functions of the EPA would include:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The establishment and enforcement of environmental protection standards consistent with national environmental goals.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The conduct of research on the adverse effects of pollution and on methods and equipment for controlling it, the gathering of information on pollution, and the use of this information in strengthening environmental protection programs and recommending policy changes.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Assisting others, through grants, technical assistance and other means in arresting pollution of the environment.</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Assisting the Council on Environmental Quality in developing and recommending to the President new policies for the protection of the environment.</p>
<p class="note-body">One natural question concerns the relationship between the EPA and the Council on Environmental Quality, recently established by Act of Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is my intention and expectation that the two will work in close harmony, reinforcing each other's mission. Essentially, the Council is a top-level advisory group (which might be compared with the Council of Economic Advisers), while the EPA would be an operating, &ldquo;line&rdquo; organization. The Council will continue to be a part of the Executive Office of the President and will perform its overall coordinating and advisory roles with respect to all Federal programs related to environmental quality.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Council, then, is concerned with all aspects of environmental quality&mdash;wildlife preservation, parklands, land use, and population growth, as well as pollution. The EPA would be charged with protecting the environment by abating pollution. In short, the Council focuses on what our broad policies in the environment field should be; the EPA would focus on setting and enforcing pollution control standards. The two are not competing, but complementary&mdash;and taken together, they should give us, for the first time, the means to mount an effectively coordinated campaign against environmental degradation in all of its many forms.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION</h4>
<p class="note-body">The oceans and the atmosphere are interacting parts of the total environmental system upon which we depend not only for the quality of our lives, but for life itself.</p>
<p class="note-body">We face immediate and compelling needs for better protection of life and property from natural hazards, and for a better understanding of the total environment&mdash;and understanding which will enable us more effectively to monitor and predict its actions, and ultimately, perhaps to exercise some degree of control over them.</p>
<p class="note-body">We also face a compelling need for exploration and development leading to the intelligent use of our marine resources. The global oceans, which constitute nearly three-fourths of the surface of our planet, are today the least-understood, the least-developed, and the least-protected part of our earth. Food from the oceans will increasingly be a key element in the world's fight against hunger. The mineral resources of the ocean beds and of the oceans themselves, are being increasingly tapped to meet the growing world demand. We must understand the nature of these resources, and assure their development without either contaminating the marine environment or upsetting its balance.</p>
<p class="note-body">Establishment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&mdash;NOAA&mdash;within the Department of Commerce would enable us to approach these tasks in a coordinated way. By employing a unified approach to the problems of the oceans and atmosphere, we can increase our knowledge and expand our opportunities not only in those areas, but in the third major component of our environment, the solid earth, as well.</p>
<p class="note-body">Scattered through various Federal departments and agencies, we already have the scientific, technological, and administrative resources to make an effective, unified approach possible. What we need is to bring them together. Establishment of NOAA would do so.</p>
<p class="note-body">By far the largest of the components being merged would be the Commerce Department's Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA), with some 10,000 employees (70 percent of NOAA's total personnel strength) and estimated Fiscal 1970 expenditures of almost $200 million. Placing NOAA within the Department of Commerce therefore entails the least dislocation, while also placing it within a Department which has traditionally been a center for service activities in the scientific and technological area.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">components of noaa</h4>
<p class="note-body">Under terms of Reorganization Plan No. 4, the programs of the following organizations would be moved into NOAA:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The Environmental Science Services Administration (from within the Department of Commerce).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Elements of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (from the Department of the Interior).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The marine sport fish program of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife (from the Department of the Interior).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The Marine Minerals Technology Center of the Bureau of Mines (from the Department of the Interior).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The Office of Sea Grant Programs (from the National Science Foundation).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;Elements of the United States Lake Survey (from the Department of the Army).</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition, by executive action, the programs of the following organizations would be transferred to NOAA:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The National Oceanographic Data Center (from the Department of the Navy).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The National Oceanographic Instrumentation Center (from the Department of the Navy).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The National Data Buoy Project (from the Department of Transportation).</p>
<p class="note-body">In brief, these are the principal functions of the programs and agencies to be combined:</p>
<h4 class="note-head">THE ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE SERVICES ADMINISTRATION</h4>
<p class="note-body">(ESSA) comprises the following components:</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The Weather Bureau (weather, marine, river and flood forecasting and warning).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The Coast and Geodetic Survey (earth and marine description, mapping and charting).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The Environmental Data Service (storage and retrieval of environmental data).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The National Environmental Satellite Center (observation of the global environment from earth-orbiting satellites).</p>
<p class="note-body-flush1_hang2">&mdash;The ESSA Research Laboratories (research on physical environmental problems).</p>
<p class="note-body">ESSA's activities include observing and predicting the state of the oceans, the state of the lower and upper atmosphere, and the size and shape of the earth. It maintains the nation's warning systems for such natural hazards as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes and seismic sea waves. It provides information for national defense, agriculture, transportation and industry.</p>
<p class="note-body">ESSA monitors atmospheric, oceanic and geophysical phenomena on a global basis, through an unparalleled <!-- PDFPage:3782 -->complex of air, ocean, earth and space facilities. It also prepares aeronautical and marine maps and charts.</p>
<p class="note-body">Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and marine sport fish activities.&mdash;Those fishery activities of the Department of the Interior's U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service which are ocean related and those which are directed toward commercial fishing would be transferred. The Fish and Wildlife Service's Bureau of Commercial Fisheries has the dual function of strengthening the fishing industry and promoting conservation of fishery stocks. It conducts research on important marine species and on fundamental oceanography, and operates a fleet of oceanographic vessels and a number of laboratories. Most of its activities would be transferred. From the Fish and Wildlife Service's Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife, the marine sport fishing program would be transferred. This involves five supporting laboratories and three ships engaged in activities to enhance marine sport fishing opportunities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Marine Minerals Technology Center is concerned with the development of marine mining technology.</p>
<p class="note-body">Office of Sea Grant Programs.&mdash;The Sea Grant Program was authorized in 1966 to permit the Federal Government to assist the academic and industrial communities in developing marine resources and technology. It aims at strengthening education and training of marine specialists, supporting applied research in the recovery and use of marine resources, and developing extension and advisory services. The Office carries out these objectives by making grants to selected academic institutions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The U.S. Lake Survey has two primary missions. It prepares and publishes navigation charts of the Great Lakes and tributary waters and conducts research on a variety of hydraulic and hydrologic phenomena of the Great Lakes&rsquo; waters. Its activities are very similar to those conducted along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts by ESSA's Coast and Geodetic Survey.</p>
<p class="note-body">The National Oceanographic Data Center is responsible for the collection and dissemination of oceanographic data accumulated by all Federal agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The National Oceanographic Instrumentation Center provides a central Federal service for the calibration and testing of oceanographic instruments.</p>
<p class="note-body">The National Data Buoy Development Project was established to determine the feasibility of deploying a system of automatic ocean buoys to obtain oceanic and atmospheric data.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">role of noaa</h4>
<p class="note-body">Drawing these activities together into a single agency would make possible a balanced Federal program to improve our understanding of the resources of the sea, and permit their development and use while guarding against the sort of thoughtless exploitation that in the past laid waste to so many of our precious natural assets. It would make possible a consolidated program for achieving a more comprehensive understanding of oceanic and atmospheric phenomena, which so greatly affect our lives and activities. It would facilitate the cooperation between public and private interests that can best serve the interests of all.</p>
<p class="note-body">I expect that NOAA would exercise leadership in developing a national oceanic and atmospheric program of research and development. It would coordinate its own scientific and technical resources with the technical and operational capabilities of other government agencies and private institutions. As important, NOAA would continue to provide those services to other agencies of government, industry and private individuals which have become essential to the efficient operation of our transportation systems, our agriculture and our national security. I expect it to maintain continuing and close liaison with the new Environmental Protection Agency and the Council on Environmental Quality as part of an effort to ensure that environmental questions are dealt with in their totality and they benefit from the full range of the government's technical and human resources.</p>
<p class="note-body">Authorities who have studied this matter, including the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources, strongly recommended the creation of a National Advisory Committee for the Oceans. I agree. Consequently, I will request, upon approval of the plan, that the Secretary of Commerce establish a National Advisory Committee for the Oceans and the Atmosphere to advise him on the progress of governmental and private programs in achieving the nation's oceanic and atmospheric objectives.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">AN ON-GOING PROCESS</h4>
<p class="note-body">The reorganizations which I am here proposing afford both the Congress and the Executive Branch an opportunity to re-evaluate the adequacy of existing program authorities involved in these consolidations. As these two new organizations come into being, we may well find that supplementary legislation to perfect their authorities will be necessary. I look forward to working with the Congress in this task.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formulating these reorganization plans, I have been greatly aided by the work of the President's Advisory Council on Executive Organization (the Ash Council), the Commission on Marine Science, Engineering and Resources (the Stratton Commission, appointed by President Johnson), my special task force on oceanography headed by Dr. James Wakelin, and by the information developed during both House and Senate hearings on proposed NOAA legislation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Many of those who have advised me have proposed additional reorganizations, and it may well be that in the future I shall recommend further changes. For the present, however, I think the two reorganizations transmitted today represent a sound and significant beginning. I also think that in practical terms, in this sensitive and rapidly developing area, it is better to proceed a step at a time&mdash;and thus to be sure that we are not caught up in a form of organizational indigestion from trying to rearrange too much at once. As we see how these changes work out, we will gain a better understanding of what further changes&mdash;in addition to these&mdash;might be desirable.</p>
<p class="note-body">Ultimately, our objective should be to insure that the nation's environmental and resource protection activities are so organized as to maximize both the effective coordination of all and the effective functioning of each.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Congress, the Administration and the public all share a profound commitment to the rescue of our natural environment, and the preservation of the Earth as a place both habitable by and hospitable to man. With its acceptance of these reorganization plans, the Congress will help us fulfill that commitment.</p>

<p class="note-body">By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, and as President of the United States of America, in furtherance of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.), the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4001 et seq.), and the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (Public Law 93&ndash;234, 87 Stat. 975) [see Short Title of 1973 Amendment note set out under 42 U.S.C. 4001], in order to avoid to the extent possible the long and short term adverse impacts associated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains and to avoid direct or indirect support of floodplain development wherever there is a practicable alternative, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. Each agency shall provide leadership and shall take action to reduce the risk of flood loss, to minimize the impact of floods on human safety, health and welfare, and to restore and preserve the natural and beneficial values served by floodplains in carrying out its responsibilities for (1) acquiring, managing, and disposing of Federal lands and facilities; (2) providing Federally undertaken, financed, or assisted construction and improvements; and (3) conducting Federal activities and programs affecting land use, including but not limited to water and related land resources planning, regulating, and licensing activities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. In carrying out the activities described in Section 1 of this Order, each agency has a responsibility to evaluate the potential effects of any actions it may take in a floodplain; to ensure that its planning programs and budget requests reflect consideration of flood hazards and floodplain management; and to prescribe procedures to implement the policies and requirements of this Order, as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a)(1) Before taking an action, each agency shall determine whether the proposed action will occur in a floodplain&mdash;for major Federal actions significantly affecting the quality of the human environment, the evaluation required below will be included in any statement prepared under Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)]. This determination shall be made according to a Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) floodplain map or a more detailed map of an area, if avail<!-- PDFPage:3787 -->able. If such maps are not available, the agency shall make a determination of the location of the floodplain based on the best available information. The Water Resources Council shall issue guidance on this information not later than October 1, 1977.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) If an agency has determined to, or proposes to, conduct, support, or allow an action to be located in a floodplain, the agency shall consider alternatives to avoid adverse effects and incompatible development in the floodplains. If the head of the agency finds that the only practicable alternative consistent with the law and with the policy set forth in this Order requires siting in a floodplain, the agency shall, prior to taking action, (i) design or modify its action in order to minimize potential harm to or within the floodplain, consistent with regulations issued in accord with Section 2(d) of this Order, and (ii) prepare and circulate a notice containing an explanation of why the action is proposed to be located in the floodplain.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) For programs subject to the Office of Management and Budget Circular A&ndash;95, the agency shall send the notice, not to exceed three pages in length including a location map, to the state and areawide A&ndash;95 clearinghouses for the geographic areas affected. The notice shall include: (i) the reasons why the action is proposed to be located in a floodplain; (ii) a statement indicating whether the action conforms to applicable state or local floodplain protection standards and (iii) a list of the alternatives considered. Agencies shall endeavor to allow a brief comment period prior to taking any action.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Each agency shall also provide opportunity for early public review of any plans or proposals for actions in floodplains, in accordance with Section 2(b) of Executive Order No. 11514, as amended [set out above], including the development of procedures to accomplish this objective for Federal actions whose impact is not significant enough to require the preparation of an environmental impact statement under Section 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, as amended [42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C)].</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Any requests for new authorizations or appropriations transmitted to the Office of Management and Budget shall indicate, if an action to be proposed will be located in a floodplain, whether the proposed action is in accord with this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Each agency shall take floodplain management into account when formulating or evaluating any water and land use plans and shall require land and water resources use appropriate to the degree of hazard involved. Agencies shall include adequate provision for the evaluation and consideration of flood hazards in the regulations and operating procedures for the licenses, permits, loan or grants-in-aid programs that they administer. Agencies shall also encourage and provide appropriate guidance to applicants to evaluate the effects of their proposals in floodplains prior to submitting applications for Federal licenses, permits, loans or grants.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) As allowed by law, each agency shall issue or amend existing regulations and procedures within one year to comply with this Order. These procedures shall incorporate the Unified National Program for Floodplain Management of the Water Resources Council, and shall explain the means that the agency will employ to pursue the nonhazardous use of riverine, coastal and other floodplains in connection with the activities under its authority. To the extent possible, existing processes, such as those of the Council on Environmental Quality and the Water Resources Council, shall be utilized to fulfill the requirements of this Order. Agencies shall prepare their procedures in consultation with the Water Resources Council, the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the Council on Environmental Quality, and shall update such procedures as necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. In addition to the requirements of Section 2, agencies with responsibilities for Federal real property and facilities shall take the following measures:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The regulations and procedures established under Section 2(d) of this Order shall, at a minimum, require the construction of Federal structures and facilities to be in accordance with the standards and criteria and to be consistent with the intent of those promulgated under the National Flood Insurance Program. They shall deviate only to the extent that the standards of the Flood Insurance Program are demonstrably inappropriate for a given type of structure or facility.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If, after compliance with the requirements of this Order, new construction of structures or facilities are to be located in a floodplain, accepted floodproofing and other flood protection measures shall be applied to new construction or rehabilitation. To achieve flood protection, agencies shall, wherever practicable, elevate structures above the base flood level rather than filling in land.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) If property used by the general public has suffered flood damage or is located in an identified flood hazard area, the responsible agency shall provide on structures, and other places where appropriate, conspicuous delineation of past and probable flood height in order to enhance public awareness of and knowledge about flood hazards.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) When property in floodplains is proposed for lease, easement, right-of-way, or disposal to non-Federal public or private parties, the Federal agency shall (1) reference in the conveyance those uses that are restricted under identified Federal, State or local floodplain regulations; and (2) attach other appropriate restrictions to the uses of properties by the grantee or purchaser and any successors, except where prohibited by law; or (3) withhold such properties from conveyance.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. In addition to any responsibilities under this Order and Sections 202 and 205 of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended (42 U.S.C. 4106 and 4128), agencies which guarantee, approve, regulate, or insure any financial transaction which is related to an area located in a floodplain shall, prior to completing action on such transaction, inform any private parties participating in the transaction of the hazards of locating structures in the floodplain.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. The head of each agency shall submit a report to the Council on Environmental Quality and to the Water Resources Council on June 30, 1978, regarding the status of their procedures and the impact of this Order on the agency's operations. Thereafter, the Water Resources Council shall periodically evaluate agency procedures and their effectiveness.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. As used in this Order:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The term &ldquo;agency&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as the term &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; in Section 105 of Title 5 of the United States Code and shall include the military departments; the directives contained in this Order, however, are meant to apply only to those agencies which perform the activities described in Section 1 which are located in or affecting floodplains.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The term &ldquo;base flood&rdquo; shall mean that flood which has a one percent or greater chance of occurrence in any given year.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The term &ldquo;floodplain&rdquo; shall mean the lowland and relatively flat areas adjoining inland and coastal waters including floodprone areas of offshore islands, including at a minimum, that area subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13045. Protection of Children From Environmental Health Risks and Safety Risks</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13045, Apr. 21, 1997, 62 F.R. 19885, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;101. A growing body of scientific knowledge demonstrates that children may suffer disproportionately from environmental health risks and safety risks. These risks arise because: children's neurological, immunological, digestive, and other bodily systems are still developing; children eat more food, drink more fluids, and breathe more air in proportion to their body weight than adults; children's size and weight may diminish their protection from standard safety features; and children's behavior patterns may make them more susceptible to accidents because they are less able to protect themselves. Therefore, to the extent permitted by law and appropriate, and consistent with the agency's mission, each Federal agency:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) shall make it a high priority to identify and assess environmental health risks and safety risks that may disproportionately affect children; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) shall ensure that its policies, programs, activities, and standards address disproportionate risks to children that result from environmental health risks or safety risks.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;102. Each independent regulatory agency is encouraged to participate in the implementation of this order and comply with its provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Definitions</em>. The following definitions shall apply to this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;201. &ldquo;Federal agency&rdquo; means any authority of the United States that is an agency under 44 U.S.C. 3502(1) other than those considered to be independent regulatory agencies under 44 U.S.C. 3502(5). For purposes of this order, &ldquo;military departments,&rdquo; as defined in 5 U.S.C. 102, are covered under the auspices of the Department of Defense.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;202. &ldquo;Covered regulatory action&rdquo; means any substantive action in a rulemaking, initiated after the date of this order or for which a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is published 1 year after the date of this order, that is likely to result in a rule that may:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) be &ldquo;economically significant&rdquo; under Executive Order 12866 [5 U.S.C. 601 note] (a rulemaking that has an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or would adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities); and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) concern an environmental health risk or safety risk that an agency has reason to believe may disproportionately affect children.</p>
<p class="note-body">2&ndash;203. &ldquo;Environmental health risks and safety risks&rdquo; mean risks to health or to safety that are attributable to products or substances that the child is likely to come in contact with or ingest (such as the air we breath, the food we eat, the water we drink or use for recreation, the soil we live on, and the products we use or are exposed to).</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the National Environmental Policy <!-- PDFPage:3796 -->Act of 1969 (Public Law 91&ndash;190) [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.], and in order to protect and restore rivers and their adjacent communities, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policies.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The American Heritage Rivers initiative has three objectives: natural resource and environmental protection, economic revitalization, and historic and cultural preservation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Executive agencies (&ldquo;agencies&rdquo;), to the extent permitted by law and consistent with their missions and resources, shall coordinate Federal plans, functions, programs, and resources to preserve, protect, and restore rivers and their associated resources important to our history, culture, and natural heritage.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Agencies shall develop plans to bring increased efficiencies to existing and authorized programs with goals that are supportive of protection and restoration of communities along rivers.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) In accordance with Executive Order 12630 [5 U.S.C. 601 note], agencies shall act with due regard for the protection of private property provided for by the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. No new regulatory authority is created as a result of the American Heritage Rivers initiative. This initiative will not interfere with matters of State, local, and tribal government jurisdiction.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) In furtherance of these policies, the President will designate rivers that meet certain criteria as &ldquo;American Heritage Rivers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) It is the policy of the Federal Government that communities shall nominate rivers as American Heritage Rivers and the Federal role will be solely to support community-based efforts to preserve, protect, and restore these rivers and their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Agencies should, to the extent practicable, help identify resources in the private and nonprofit sectors to aid revitalization efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Agencies are encouraged, to the extent permitted by law, to develop partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments and community and nongovernmental organizations. Agencies will be responsive to the diverse needs of different kinds of communities from the core of our cities to remote rural areas and shall seek to ensure that the role played by the Federal Government is complementary to the plans and work being carried out by State, local, and tribal governments. To the extent possible, Federal resources will be strategically directed to complement resources being spent by these governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Agencies shall establish a method for field offices to assess the success of the American Heritage River initiative and provide a means to recommend changes that will improve the delivery and accessibility of Federal services and programs. Agencies are directed, where appropriate, to reduce and make more flexible procedural requirements and paperwork related to providing assistance to communities along designated rivers.</p>
<p class="note-body">(j) Agencies shall commit to a policy under which they will seek to ensure that their actions have a positive effect on the natural, historic, economic, and cultural resources of American Heritage River communities. The policy will require agencies to consult with American Heritage River communities early in the planning stages of Federal actions, take into account the communities&rsquo; goals and objectives and ensure that actions are compatible with the overall character of these communities. Agencies shall seek to ensure that their help for one community does not adversely affect neighboring communities. Additionally, agencies are encouraged to develop formal and informal partnerships to assist communities. Local Federal facilities, to the extent permitted by law and consistent with the agencies&rsquo; missions and resources, should provide public access, physical space, technical assistance, and other support for American Heritage River communities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(k) In addition to providing support to designated rivers, agencies will work together to provide information and services to all communities seeking support.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Process for Nominating an American Heritage River.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Nomination</em>. Communities, in coordination with their State, local, or tribal governments, can nominate their river, river stretch, or river confluence for designation as an American Heritage River. When several communities are involved in the nomination of the same river, nominations will detail the coordination among the interested communities and the role each will play in the process. Individuals living outside the community may not nominate a river.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Selection Criteria</em>. Nominations will be judged based on the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) the characteristics of the natural, economic, agricultural, scenic, historic, cultural, or recreational resources of the river that render it distinctive or unique;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) the effectiveness with which the community has defined its plan of action and the extent to which the plan addresses, either through planned actions or past accomplishments, all three American Heritage Rivers objectives, which are set forth in section 1(a) of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) the strength and diversity of community support for the nomination as evidenced by letters from elected officials; landowners; private citizens; businesses; and especially State, local, and tribal governments. Broad community support is essential to receiving the American Heritage River designation; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) willingness and capability of the community to forge partnerships and agreements to implement their plan to meet their goals and objectives.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) utilize a systematic, interdisciplinary approach which will insure the integrated use of the natural and social sciences and the environmental design arts in planning and in de<!-- PDFPage:3801 -->cisionmaking which may have an impact on man's environment;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Prior to making any detailed statement, the responsible Federal official shall consult with and obtain the comments of any Federal agency which has jurisdiction by law or special expertise with respect to any environmental impact involved. Copies of such statement and the comments and views of the appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, which are authorized to develop and enforce environmental standards, shall be made available to the President, the Council on Environmental Quality and to the public as provided by section 552 of title 5, and shall accompany the proposal through the existing agency review processes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Any detailed statement required under subparagraph (C) after January 1, 1970, for any major Federal action funded under a program of grants to States shall not be deemed to be legally insufficient solely by reason of having been prepared by a State agency or official, if:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the State agency or official has statewide jurisdiction and has the responsibility for such action,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the responsible Federal official furnishes guidance and participates in such preparation,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) recognize the worldwide and long-range character of environmental problems and, where consistent with the foreign policy of the United States, lend appropriate support to initiatives, resolutions, and programs designed to maximize international cooperation in anticipating and preventing a decline in the quality of mankind's world environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) make available to States, counties, municipalities, institutions, and individuals, advice and information useful in restoring, maintaining, and enhancing the quality of the environment;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Short title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section may be cited as the &ldquo;Indian Environmental General Assistance Program Act of 1992&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this section are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide general assistance grants to Indian tribal governments and intertribal consortia to build capacity to administer environmental regulatory programs that may be delegated by the Environmental Protection Agency on Indian lands; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide technical assistance from the Environmental Protection Agency to Indian tribal governments and intertribal consortia in the development of multimedia programs to address environmental issues on Indian lands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;Indian tribal government&rdquo; means any Indian tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community, including any Alaska Native village or regional or village corporation (as defined in, or established pursuant to, the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act (43 U.S.C.A. 1601, et seq.)), which is recognized as eligible for the special services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;intertribal consortia&rdquo; or &ldquo;intertribal consortium&rdquo; means a partnership between two or more Indian tribal governments authorized by the governing bodies of those tribes to apply for and receive assistance pursuant to this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) No reduction in amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In no case shall the award of a general assistance grant to an Indian tribal government or intertribal consortium under this section result in a reduction of Environmental Protection Agency grants for environmental programs to that tribal government or consortium. Nothing in this section shall preclude an Indian tribal government or intertribal consortium from receiving individual media grants or cooperative agreements. Funds provided by the Environmental Protection Agency through the general assistance program shall be used by an Indian <!-- PDFPage:3812 -->tribal government or intertribal consortium to supplement other funds provided by the Environmental Protection Agency through individual media grants or cooperative agreements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Expenditure of general assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any general assistance under this section shall be expended for the purpose of planning, developing, and establishing the capability to implement programs administered by the Environmental Protection Agency and specified in the assistance agreement. Purposes and programs authorized under this section shall include the development and implementation of solid and hazardous waste programs for Indian lands. An Indian tribal government or intertribal consortium receiving general assistance pursuant to this section shall utilize such funds for programs and purposes to be carried out in accordance with the terms of the assistance agreement. Such programs and general assistance shall be carried out in accordance with the purposes and requirements of applicable provisions of law, including the Solid Waste Disposal Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Procedures</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Report to Congress</h4>
