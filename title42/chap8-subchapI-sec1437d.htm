<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions; playgrounds and elevators</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may include in any contract for loans, contributions, sale, lease, mortgage, or any other agreement or instrument made pursuant to this chapter, such covenants, conditions, or provisions as he may deem necessary in order to insure the lower income character of the project involved. Any such contract may contain a condition requiring the maintenance of an open space or playground in connection with the housing project involved if deemed necessary by the Secretary for the safety or health of children. Any such contract shall require that, except in the case of housing predominantly for elderly or disabled families, high-rise elevator projects shall not be provided for families with children unless the Secretary makes a determination that there is no practical alternative.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on development costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each contract for loans (other than preliminary loans) or contributions for the development, acquisition, or operation of public housing shall provide that the total development cost of the project on which the computation of any annual contributions under this chapter may be based may not exceed the amount determined under paragraph (2) (for the appropriate structure type) unless the Secretary provides otherwise, and in any case may not exceed 110 per centum of such amount unless the Secretary for good cause determines otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the Secretary shall determine the total development cost by multiplying the construction cost guideline for the project (which shall be determined by averaging the current construction costs, as listed by not less than 2 nationally recognized residential construction cost indices, for publicly bid construction of a good and sound quality) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of elevator type structures, 1.6; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Revision of maximum income limits; certification of compliance with requirements; notification of eligibility; informal hearing; compliance with procedures for sound management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary may require the public housing agency to review and revise its maximum income limits if the Secretary determines that changed conditions in the locality make such revision necessary in achieving the purposes of this chapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public housing agency shall determine, and so certify to the Secretary, that each family in the project was admitted in accordance with duly adopted regulations and approved income limits; and the public housing agency shall review the incomes of families living in the project no less frequently than annually;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the public housing agency shall promptly notify (i) any applicant determined to be ineligible for admission to the project of the basis for such determination and provide the applicant upon request, within a reasonable time after the determination is made, with an opportunity for an informal hearing on such determination, and (ii) any applicant determined to be eligible for admission to the project of the approximate date of occupancy insofar as such date can be reasonably determined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the public housing agency shall comply with such procedures and requirements as the Secretary may prescribe to assure that sound management practices will be followed in the operation of the project, including requirements pertaining to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the establishment, after public notice and an opportunity for public comment, of a written system of preferences for admission to public housing, if any, that is not inconsistent with the comprehensive housing affordability strategy under title I of the Cranston-Gonzalez National Affordable Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 12701 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of satisfactory procedures designed to assure the prompt payment and collection of rents and the prompt processing of evictions in the case of nonpayment of rent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the establishment of effective tenant-management relationships designed to assure that satisfactory standards of tenant security and project maintenance are formulated and that the public housing agency (together with tenant councils where they exist) enforces those standards fully and effectively;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the development by local housing authority managements of viable homeownership opportunity programs for low-income families capable of assuming the responsibilities of homeownership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) except in the case of agencies not receiving operating assistance under section 1437g of this title, the establishment and maintenance of a system of accounting for rental collections and costs (including administrative, utility, maintenance, repair and other operating costs) for each project or operating cost center (as determined by the Secretary), which collections and costs shall be made available to the general public and submitted to the appropriate local public official (as determined by the Secretary); except that the Secretary may permit agencies owning or operating less than 500 units <!-- PDFPage:2464 -->to comply with the requirements of this subparagraph by accounting on an agency-wide basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) requiring the public housing agency to ensure and maintain compliance with subtitle C of title VI of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13601 et seq.] and any regulations issued under such subtitle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exemption from personal and real property taxes; payments in lieu of taxes; cash contribution or tax remission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions with respect to a low-income housing project shall provide that no contributions by the Secretary shall be made available for such project unless such project (exclusive of any portion thereof which is not assisted by contributions under this chapter) is exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by the State, city, county, or other political subdivision; and such contract shall require the public housing agency to make payments in lieu of taxes equal to 10 per centum of the sum of the shelter rents charged in such project, or such lesser amount as (i) is prescribed by State law, or (ii) is agreed to by the local governing body in its agreement for local cooperation with the public housing agency required under section 1437c(e)(2) of this title, or (iii) is due to failure of a local public body or bodies other than the public housing agency to perform any obligation under such agreement. If any such project is not exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by the State, city, county, or other political subdivision, such contract shall provide, in lieu of the requirement for tax exemption and payments in lieu of taxes, that no contributions by the Secretary shall be made available for such project unless and until the State, city, county, or other political subdivision in which such project is situated shall contribute, in the form of cash or tax remission, the amount by which the taxes paid with respect to the project exceed 10 per centum of the shelter rents charged in such project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Excess funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for annual contributions shall provide that whenever in any year the receipts of a public housing agency in connection with a low-income housing project exceed its expenditures (including debt service, operation, maintenance, establishment of reserves, and other costs and charges), an amount equal to such excess shall be applied, or set aside for application, to purposes, which, in the determination of the Secretary, will effect a reduction in the amount of subsequent annual contributions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Repealed. Pub. L. 98&ndash;181, title II, &sect;214(b), Nov. 30, 1983, 97 Stat. 1185</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Substantial default; conveyance of title and delivery of possession; reconveyance and redelivery; payments for outstanding obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every contract for contributions (including contracts which amend or supersede contracts previously made) may provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) upon the occurrence of a substantial default in respect to the covenants or conditions to which the public housing agency is subject (as such substantial default shall be defined in such contract), the public housing agency shall be obligated at the option of the Secretary either to convey title in any case where, in the determination of the Secretary (which determination shall be final and conclusive), such conveyance of title is necessary to achieve the purposes of this chapter, or to deliver to the Secretary possession of the project, as then constituted, to which such contract relates; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary shall be obligated to reconvey or redeliver possession of the project as constituted at the time of reconveyance or redelivery, to such public housing agency or to its successor (if such public housing agency or a successor exists) upon such terms as shall be prescribed in such contract, and as soon as practicable (i) after the Secretary is satisfied that all defaults with respect to the project have been cured, and that the project will, in order to fulfill the purposes of this chapter, thereafter be operated in accordance with the terms of such contract; or (ii) after the termination of the obligation to make annual contributions available unless there are any obligations or covenants of the public housing agency to the Secretary which are then in default. Any prior conveyances and reconveyances or deliveries and redeliveries of possession shall not exhaust the right to require a conveyance or delivery of possession of the project to the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (1) upon the subsequent occurrence of a substantial default.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Whenever such a contract for annual contributions includes provisions which the Secretary in such contract determines are in accordance with this subsection, and the portion of the annual contribution payable for debt service requirements pursuant to such contract has been pledged by the public housing agency as security for the payment of the principal and interest on any of its obligations, the Secretary (notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter) shall continue to make such annual contributions available for the project so long as any of such obligations remain outstanding, and may covenant in such contract that in any event such annual contributions shall in each year be at least equal to an amount which, together with such income or other funds as are actually available from the project for the purpose at the time such annual contribution is made, will suffice for the payment of all installments, falling due within the next succeeding twelve months, of principal and interest on the obligations for which the annual contributions provided for in the contract shall have been pledged as security. In no case shall such annual contributions be in excess of the maximum sum specified in the contract involved, nor for longer than the remainder of the maximum period fixed by the contract.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) New construction contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On or after October 1, 1983, the Secretary may enter into a contract involving new construction only if the public housing agency demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:2465 -->that the cost of new construction in the neighborhood where the public housing agency determines the housing is needed is less than the cost of acquisition or acquisition and rehabilitation in such neighborhood, including any reserve fund under subsection (i) of this section, would be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Reserve fund; major repairs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, upon application by a public housing agency in connection with the acquisition of housing for use as public housing, establish and set aside a reserve fund in an amount not to exceed 30 per centum of the acquisition cost which shall be available for use for major repairs to such housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Performance indicators for public housing agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall develop and publish in the Federal Register indicators to assess the management performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations. The indicators shall be established by rule under section 553 of title 5. Such indicators shall enable the Secretary to evaluate the performance of public housing agencies and resident management corporations in all major areas of management operations. The Secretary shall, in particular, use the following indicators for public housing agencies, to the extent practicable:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The number and percentage of vacancies within an agency's inventory, including the progress that an agency has made within the previous 3 years to reduce such vacancies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount and percentage of funds obligated to the public housing agency under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title which remain unexpended after 3 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The percentage of rents uncollected.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) The energy consumption (with appropriate adjustments to reflect different regions and unit sizes).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The average period of time that an agency requires to repair and turn-around vacant units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The proportion of maintenance work orders outstanding, including any progress that an agency has made during the preceding 3 years to reduce the period of time required to complete maintenance work orders.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The percentage of units that an agency fails to inspect to ascertain maintenance or modernization needs within such period of time as the Secretary deems appropriate (with appropriate adjustments, if any, for large and small agencies).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Any other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate which shall not exceed the seven factors in the statute, plus an additional five.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) The Secretary shall:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(1) administer the system of evaluating public housing agencies flexibly to ensure that such agencies are not penalized as result of circumstances beyond their control;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(2) reflect in the weights assigned to the various indicators the differences in the difficulty of managing individual projects that result from their physical condition and their neighborhood environment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(3) determine a public housing agency's status as &ldquo;troubled with respect to the program under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title&rdquo; based upon factors solely related to its ability to carry out that program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) The Secretary shall, under the rulemaking procedures under section 553 of title 5, establish procedures for designating troubled public housing agencies, which procedures shall include identification of serious and substantial failure to perform as measured by the performance indicators specified under paragraph (1) and such other factors as the Secretary may deem to be appropriate. The Secretary shall also designate, by rule under section 553 of title 5, agencies that are troubled with respect to the program under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may also, in consultation with national organizations representing public housing agencies and public officials (as the Secretary determines appropriate), identify and commend public housing agencies that meet the performance standards established under paragraph (1) in an exemplary manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall establish procedures for public housing agencies to appeal designation as a troubled agency (including designation as a troubled agency for purposes of the program under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title), to petition for removal of such designation, and to appeal any refusal to remove such designation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Upon designating a public housing agency as troubled pursuant to subparagraph (A) and determining that an assessment under this subparagraph will not duplicate any review conducted under section 1437<em>l</em>(p) of this title, the Secretary shall provide for an on-site, independent assessment of the management of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency's performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), the assessment team shall also consider issues relating to the agency's resident population and physical inventory, including the extent to which (I) the agency's comprehensive plan prepared pursuant to section 1437<em>l</em> of this title adequately and appropriately addresses the rehabilitation needs of the agency's inventory, (II) residents of the agency are involved in and informed of significant management decisions, and (III) any projects in the agency's inventory are severely distressed and eligible for assistance pursuant to section 1437v of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) An independent assessment under this subparagraph shall be carried out by a team of knowledgeable individuals selected by the Secretary (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;assessment team&rdquo;) with expertise in public housing and real estate management. In conducting an assessment, the assessment team shall consult with the residents and with public and private entities in the jurisdiction in which the public housing is located. The assessment team shall provide to the Secretary and the public housing agency a written report, which shall contain, at a minimum, recommendations for such management improvements as are necessary to eliminate or substantially remedy existing deficiencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall seek to enter into an agreement with each troubled public housing agency, after reviewing the report submitted <!-- PDFPage:2466 -->pursuant to subparagraph (B) and consulting with the agency's assessment team. Such agreement shall set forth&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) targets for improving performance as measured by the performance indicators specified under paragraph (1) and other requirements within a specified period of time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) strategies for meeting such targets, including a description of the technical assistance that the Secretary will make available to the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) incentives or sanctions for effective implementation of such strategies, which may include any constraints on the use of funds that the Secretary determines are appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent the Secretary deems appropriate (taking into account an agency's performance under the indicators specified under paragraph (1)), such agreement shall also set forth a plan for enhancing resident involvement in the management of the public housing agency. The Secretary and the public housing agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, seek the assistance of local public and private entities in carrying out the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall apply the provisions of this paragraph to resident management corporations as well as public housing agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or of any contract for contributions, upon the occurrence of events or conditions that constitute a substantial default by a public housing agency with respect to the covenants or conditions to which the public housing agency is subject or an agreement entered into under paragraph (2), the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) solicit competitive proposals from other public housing agencies and private housing management agents (which may be selected by existing tenants through administrative procedures established by the Secretary) in the eventuality that these agents may be needed for managing all, or part, of the housing administered by a public housing agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) petition for the appointment of a receiver (which may be another public housing agency or a private management corporation) of the public housing agency to any district court of the United States or to any court of the State in which the real property of the public housing agency is situated, that is authorized to appoint a receiver for the purposes and having the powers prescribed in this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) solicit competitive proposals from other public housing agencies and private entities with experience in construction management in the eventuality that such agencies or firms may be needed to oversee implementation of assistance made available under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title for the housing; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) require the agency to make other arrangements acceptable to the Secretary and in the best interests of the public housing residents for managing all, or part of, such housing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Residents of a public housing agency designated as troubled pursuant to paragraph (2)(A) may petition the Secretary in writing to take 1 or more of the actions referred to in this subparagraph. The Secretary shall respond to such petitions in a timely manner with a written description of the actions, if any, the Secretary plans to take and, where applicable, the reasons why such actions differ from the course proposed by the residents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may make available to receivers and other entities selected or appointed pursuant to this paragraph such assistance as is necessary to remedy the substantial deterioration of living conditions in individual public housing developments or other related emergencies that endanger the health, safety and welfare of the residents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In any proceeding under subparagraph (A)(ii), upon a determination that a substantial default has occurred, and without regard to the availability of alternative remedies, the court shall appoint a receiver to conduct the affairs of the public housing agency in a manner consistent with this chapter and in accordance with such further terms and conditions as the court may provide. The court shall have power to grant appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the petition by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The appointment of a receiver pursuant to this subsection may be terminated, upon the petition of any party, when the court determines that all defaults have been cured and the housing operated by the public housing agency will thereafter be operated in accordance with the covenants and conditions to which the public housing agency is subject.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall submit to the Congress annually, as a part of the report of the Secretary under section 3536 of this title, a report that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) identifies the public housing agencies that have been designated as troubled under paragraph (2);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) describes the agreements that have been entered into with such agencies under such paragraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) describes the status of progress under such agreements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) describes any action that has been taken in accordance with paragraph (3), including an accounting of the authorized funds that have been expended to support such actions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) describes the status of any public housing agency designated as troubled with respect to the program under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title and specifies the amount of assistance the agency received under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title and any credits accumulated by the agency under section 1437<em>l</em>(k)(5)(D) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) be entitled to receive a written decision by the public housing agency on the proposed action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For any grievance concerning an eviction or termination of tenancy that involves any activity that threatens the health, safety, or right to peaceful enjoyment of the premises of other tenants or employees of the public housing agency or any drug-related criminal activity on or off such premises, the agency may (A) establish an expedited grievance procedure as the Secretary shall provide by rule under section 553 of title 5, or (B) exclude from its grievance procedure any such grievance, in any jurisdiction which requires that prior to eviction, a tenant be given a hearing in court which the Secretary determines provides the basic elements of due process (which the Secretary shall establish by rule under section 553 of title 5). Such elements of due process shall not include a requirement that the tenant be provided an opportunity to examine relevant documents within the possession of the public housing agency. The agency shall provide to the tenant a reasonable opportunity, prior to hearing or trial, to examine any relevant documents, records, or regulations directly related to the eviction or termination.</p>
