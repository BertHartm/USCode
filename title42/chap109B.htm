<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in coordination with the Advisory Committee and State and local water resource agencies, shall establish a national assessment program to be known as the &ldquo;national water availability and use assessment program&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide a more accurate assessment of the status of the water resources of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to assist in the determination of the quantity of water that is available for beneficial uses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to assist in the determination of the quality of the water resources of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to identify long-term trends in water availability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to use each long-term trend described in paragraph (4) to provide a more accurate assessment of the change in the availability of water in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to develop the basis for an improved ability to forecast the availability of water for future economic, energy production, and environmental uses.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program elements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Water use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the assessment program, the Secretary shall conduct any appropriate activity to carry out an ongoing assessment of water use in hydrologic accounting units and major aquifer systems located in the United States, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the maintenance of a comprehensive national water use inventory to enhance the level of understanding with respect to the effects of spatial and temporal patterns of water use on the availability and sustainable use of water resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the incorporation of water use science principles, with an emphasis on applied research and statistical estimation techniques in the assessment of water use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the integration of any dataset maintained by any other Federal or State agency into the dataset maintained by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a focus on the scientific integration of any data relating to water use, water flow, or water quality to generate relevant information relating to the impact of human activity on water and ecological resources.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Water availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the assessment program, the Secretary shall conduct an ongoing assessment of water availability by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) developing and evaluating nationally consistent indicators that reflect each status and trend relating to the availability of water resources in the United States, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) surface water indicators, such as streamflow and surface water storage measures (including lakes, reservoirs, perennial snowfields, and glaciers);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) groundwater indicators, including groundwater level measurements and changes in groundwater levels due to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) natural recharge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) withdrawals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) saltwater intrusion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) mine dewatering;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) land drainage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) artificial recharge; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VII) other relevant factors, as determined by the Secretary; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) impaired surface water and groundwater supplies that are known, accessible, and used to meet ongoing water demands;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) maintaining a national database of water availability data that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is comprised of maps, reports, and other forms of interpreted data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides electronic access to the archived data of the national database; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) provides for real-time data collection; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) developing and applying predictive modeling tools that integrate groundwater, surface water, and ecological systems.</p>
