<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Recovery of amounts owed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amounts owed to the WTC Program Administrator under such contract shall be recoverable by the United States in an action in the same manner as payments made under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] may be recoverable in an action brought under section 1862(b)(2)(B)(iii) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1395y(b)(2)(B)(iii)].</p>
