<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Services not covered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payment under this part for services furnished an individual during a spell of illness may not (subject to subsection (c) of this section) be made for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) inpatient hospital services furnished to him during such spell after such services have been furnished to him for 150 days during such spell minus 1 day for each day of inpatient hospital services in excess of 90 received during any preceding spell of illness (if such individual was entitled to have payment for such services made under this part unless he specifies in accordance with regulations of the Secretary that he does not desire to have such payment made);</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Inpatients of psychiatric hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an individual is an inpatient of a psychiatric hospital on the first day of the first month for which he is entitled to benefits under this part, the days on which he was an inpatient of such a hospital in the 150-day period immediately before such first day shall be included in determining the number of days limit under subsection (b)(1) of this section insofar as such limit applies to (1) inpatient psychiatric hospital services, or (2) inpatient hospital services for an individual who is an inpatient primarily for the diagnosis or treatment of mental illness (but shall not be included in determining such number of days limit insofar as it applies to other inpatient hospital services or in determining the 190-day limit under subsection (b)(3) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Hospice care; election; waiver of rights; revocation; change of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payment under this part may be made for hospice care provided with respect to an individual only during two periods of 90 days each, a subsequent period of 30 days, and a subsequent extension period during the individual's lifetime and only, with respect to each such period, if the individual makes an election under this paragraph to receive hospice care under this part provided by, or under arrangements made by, a particular hospice program instead of certain other benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B) and (C) and except in such exceptional and unusual circumstances as the Secretary may provide, if an individual makes such an election for a period with respect to a particular hospice program, the individual shall be deemed to have waived all rights to have payment made under this subchapter with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) hospice care provided by another hospice program (other than under arrangements made by the particular hospice program) during the period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) services furnished during the period that are determined (in accordance with guidelines of the Secretary) to be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) related to the treatment of the individual's condition with respect to which a diagnosis of terminal illness has been made or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) equivalent to (or duplicative of) hospice care;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that clause (ii) shall not apply to physicians&rsquo; services furnished by the individual's attending physician (if not an employee of the hospice program) or to services provided by (or under arrangements made by) the hospice program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After an individual makes such an election with respect to a 90- or 30-day period or a subsequent extension period, the individual may revoke the election during the period, in which case&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the revocation shall act as a waiver of the right to have payment made under this part for any hospice care benefits for the remaining time in such period and (for purposes of subsection (a)(4) of this section and subparagraph (A)) the individual shall be deemed to have been provided such benefits during such entire period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the individual may at any time after the revocation execute a new election for a subsequent period, if the individual otherwise is entitled to hospice care benefits with respect to such a period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An individual may, once in each such period, change the hospice program with respect to which the election is made and such change shall not be considered a revocation of an election under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this subchapter, an individual's election with respect to a hospice program shall no longer be considered to be in effect with respect to that hospice program after the date the individual's revocation or change of election with respect to that election takes effect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Services taken into account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, inpatient hospital services, inpatient psychiatric hospital services, and post-hospital extended care services shall be taken into account only if payment is or would be, except for this section or the failure to comply with the request and certification requirements of or under section 1395f(a) of this title, made with respect to such services under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Coverage of extended care services without regard to three-day prior hospitalization requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall provide for coverage, under clause (B) of subsection (a)(2) of this section, of extended care services which are not post-hospital extended care services at such time and for so long as the Secretary determines, and under such terms and conditions (described in paragraph (2)) as the Secretary finds appropriate, that the inclusion of such services will not result in any increase in the total of payments made under this subchapter and will not alter the acute care nature of the benefit described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may provide&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for such limitations on the scope and extent of services described in subsection (a)(2)(B) of this section and on the categories of individuals who may be eligible to receive such services, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) notwithstanding sections 1395f, 1395x(v), and 1395ww of this title, for such restrictions and alternatives on the amounts and methods of payment for services described in such subsection,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">as may be necessary to carry out paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Spell of illness&rdquo; defined</h4>
