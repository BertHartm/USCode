<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Classifications and attainment dates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Classifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) On or after the date the Administrator promulgates the designation of an area as a nonattainment area pursuant to section 7407(d) of this title with respect to any national ambient air quality standard (or any revised standard, including a revision of any standard in effect on November 15, 1990), the Administrator may classify the area for the purpose of applying an attainment date pursuant to paragraph (2), and for other purposes. In determining the appropriate classification, if any, for a nonattainment area, the Administrator may consider such factors as the severity of nonattainment in such area and the availability and feasibility of the pollution control measures that the Administrator believes may be necessary to provide for attainment of such standard in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Administrator shall publish a notice in the Federal Register announcing each classification under subparagraph (A), except the Administrator shall provide an opportunity for at least 30 days for written comment. Such classification shall not be subject to the provisions of sections 553 through 557 of title 5 (concerning notice and comment) and shall not be subject to judicial review until the Administrator takes final action under subsection (k) or (<em>l</em>) of section 7410 of this title (concerning action on plan submissions) or section 7509 of this title (concerning sanctions) with respect to any plan submissions required by virtue of such classification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) This paragraph shall not apply with respect to nonattainment areas for which classifications are specifically provided under other provisions of this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Attainment dates for nonattainment areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The attainment date for an area designated nonattainment with respect to a national primary ambient air quality standard shall be the date by which attainment can be achieved as expeditiously as practicable, but no later than 5 years from the date such area was designated nonattainment under section 7407(d) of this title, except that the Administrator may extend the attainment date to the extent the Administrator determines appropriate, for a period no greater than 10 years from the date of designation as nonattainment, considering the severity of nonattainment and the availability and feasibility of pollution control measures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The attainment date for an area designated nonattainment with respect to a secondary national ambient air quality standard shall be the date by which attainment can be achieved as expeditiously as practicable after the date such area was designated nonattainment under section 7407(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Upon application by any State, the Administrator may extend for 1 additional year (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Extension Year&rdquo;) the attainment date determined by the Administrator under subparagraph (A) or (B) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the State has complied with all requirements and commitments pertaining to the area in the applicable implementation plan, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in accordance with guidance published by the Administrator, no more than a minimal number of exceedances of the relevant national ambient air quality standard has occurred in the area in the year preceding the Extension Year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">No more than 2 one-year extensions may be issued under this subparagraph for a single nonattainment area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) This paragraph shall not apply with respect to nonattainment areas for which attainment dates are specifically provided under other provisions of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Schedule for plan submissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the time the Administrator promulgates the designation of an area as nonattainment with respect to a national ambient air quality standard under section 7407(d) of this title, the Administrator shall establish a schedule according to which the State containing such area shall submit a plan or plan revision (including the plan items) meeting the applicable requirements of subsection (c) of this section and section 7410(a)(2) of this title. Such schedule shall at a minimum, include a date or dates, extending no later than 3 years from the date of the <!-- PDFPage:5460 -->nonattainment designation, for the submission of a plan or plan revision (including the plan items) meeting the applicable requirements of subsection (c) of this section and section 7410(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Nonattainment plan provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The plan provisions (including plan items) required to be submitted under this part shall comply with each of the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such plan provisions shall provide for the implementation of all reasonably available control measures as expeditiously as practicable (including such reductions in emissions from existing sources in the area as may be obtained through the adoption, at a minimum, of reasonably available control technology) and shall provide for attainment of the national primary ambient air quality standards.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) RFP</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such plan provisions shall require reasonable further progress.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Inventory</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such plan provisions shall include a comprehensive, accurate, current inventory of actual emissions from all sources of the relevant pollutant or pollutants in such area, including such periodic revisions as the Administrator may determine necessary to assure that the requirements of this part are met.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Identification and quantification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such plan provisions shall expressly identify and quantify the emissions, if any, of any such pollutant or pollutants which will be allowed, in accordance with section 7503(a)(1)(B) of this title, from the construction and operation of major new or modified stationary sources in each such area. The plan shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Administrator that the emissions quantified for this purpose will be consistent with the achievement of reasonable further progress and will not interfere with attainment of the applicable national ambient air quality standard by the applicable attainment date.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Permits for new and modified major stationary sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such plan provisions shall require permits for the construction and operation of new or modified major stationary sources anywhere in the nonattainment area, in accordance with section 7503 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Other measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such plan provisions shall include enforceable emission limitations, and such other control measures, means or techniques (including economic incentives such as fees, marketable permits, and auctions of emission rights), as well as schedules and timetables for compliance, as may be necessary or appropriate to provide for attainment of such standard in such area by the applicable attainment date specified in this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Compliance with section 7410(a)(2)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such plan provisions shall also meet the applicable provisions of section 7410(a)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Equivalent techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon application by any State, the Administrator may allow the use of equivalent modeling, emission inventory, and planning procedures, unless the Administrator determines that the proposed techniques are, in the aggregate, less effective than the methods specified by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Contingency measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Such plan shall provide for the implementation of specific measures to be undertaken if the area fails to make reasonable further progress, or to attain the national primary ambient air quality standard by the attainment date applicable under this part. Such measures shall be included in the plan revision as contingency measures to take effect in any such case without further action by the State or the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Plan revisions required in response to finding of plan inadequacy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any plan revision for a nonattainment area which is required to be submitted in response to a finding by the Administrator pursuant to section 7410(k)(5) of this title (relating to calls for plan revisions) must correct the plan deficiency (or deficiencies) specified by the Administrator and meet all other applicable plan requirements of section 7410 of this title and this part. The Administrator may reasonably adjust the dates otherwise applicable under such requirements to such revision (except for attainment dates that have not yet elapsed), to the extent necessary to achieve a consistent application of such requirements. In order to facilitate submittal by the States of adequate and approvable plans consistent with the applicable requirements of this chapter, the Administrator shall, as appropriate and from time to time, issue written guidelines, interpretations, and information to the States which shall be available to the public, taking into consideration any such guidelines, interpretations, or information provided before November 15, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Future modification of standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator relaxes a national primary ambient air quality standard after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall, within 12 months after the relaxation, promulgate requirements applicable to all areas which have not attained that standard as of the date of such relaxation. Such requirements shall provide for controls which are not less stringent than the controls applicable to areas designated nonattainment before such relaxation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The permit program required by section 7502(b)(6)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7503_1_target" name="7503_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall provide that permits to construct and operate may be issued if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in accordance with regulations issued by the Administrator for the determination of baseline emissions in a manner consistent with the assumptions underlying the applicable implementation plan approved under section 7410 of this title and this part, the permitting agency determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) by the time the source is to commence operation, sufficient offsetting emissions reductions have been obtained, such that total allowable emissions from existing sources in the region, from new or modified sources which are not major emitting facilities, and from the proposed source will be sufficiently less than total emissions from existing sources (as determined in accordance with the regulations under this paragraph) prior to the application for such permit to construct or modify so as to represent (when considered together with the plan provisions required under section 7502 of this title) reasonable further progress (as defined in section 7501 of this title); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of a new or modified major stationary source which is located in a zone (within the nonattainment area) identified by the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, as a zone to which economic development should be targeted, that emissions of such pollutant resulting from the proposed new or modified major stationary source will not cause or contribute to emissions levels which exceed the allowance permitted for such pollutant for such area from new or modified major stationary sources under section 7502(c) of this title;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the proposed source is required to comply with the lowest achievable emission rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the owner or operator of the proposed new or modified source has demonstrated that all major stationary sources owned or operated by such person (or by any entity controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such person) in such State are subject to emission limitations and are in compliance, or on a schedule for compliance, with all applica<!-- PDFPage:5462 -->ble emission limitations and standards under this chapter; and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7503_2_target" name="7503_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the Administrator has not determined that the applicable implementation plan is not being adequately implemented for the nonattainment area in which the proposed source is to be constructed or modified in accordance with the requirements of this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an analysis of alternative sites, sizes, production processes, and environmental control techniques for such proposed source demonstrates that benefits of the proposed source significantly outweigh the environmental and social costs imposed as a result of its location, construction, or modification.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any emission reductions required as a precondition of the issuance of a permit under paragraph (1) shall be federally enforceable before such permit may be issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibition on use of old growth allowances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any growth allowance included in an applicable implementation plan to meet the requirements of section 7502(b)(5) of this title (as in effect immediately before November 15, 1990) shall not be valid for use in any area that received or receives a notice under section 7410(a)(2)(H)(ii) of this title (as in effect immediately before November 15, 1990) or under section 7410(k)(1) of this title that its applicable implementation plan containing such allowance is substantially inadequate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Offsets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The owner or operator of a new or modified major stationary source may comply with any offset requirement in effect under this part for increased emissions of any air pollutant only by obtaining emission reductions of such air pollutant from the same source or other sources in the same nonattainment area, except that the State may allow the owner or operator of a source to obtain such emission reductions in another nonattainment area if (A) the other area has an equal or higher nonattainment classification than the area in which the source is located and (B) emissions from such other area contribute to a violation of the national ambient air quality standard in the nonattainment area in which the source is located. Such emission reductions shall be, by the time a new or modified source commences operation, in effect and enforceable and shall assure that the total tonnage of increased emissions of the air pollutant from the new or modified source shall be offset by an equal or greater reduction, as applicable, in the actual emissions of such air pollutant from the same or other sources in the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Emission reductions otherwise required by this chapter shall not be creditable as emissions reductions for purposes of any such offset requirement.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The determination of conformity shall be based on the most recent estimates of emissions, and such estimates shall be determined from the most recent population, employment, travel and congestion estimates as determined by the metropolitan planning organization or other agency authorized to make such estimates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any transportation plan or program developed pursuant to title 23 or chapter 53 of title 49 shall implement the transportation provisions of any applicable implementation plan approved under this chapter applicable to all or part of the area covered by such transportation plan or program. No Federal agency may approve, accept or fund any transportation plan, program or project unless such plan, program or project has been found to conform to any applicable implementation plan in effect under this chapter.

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Such procedures shall also include a requirement that each State shall submit to the Administrator and the Secretary of Transportation within 24 months of November 15, 1990, a revision to its implementation plan that includes criteria and procedures for assessing the conformity of any plan, program, or project subject to the conformity requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Compliance with the rules of the Administrator for determining the conformity of transportation plans, programs, and projects funded or approved under title 23 or chapter 53 of title 49 to State or Federal implementation plans shall not be required for traffic signal synchronization projects prior to the funding, approval or implementation of such projects. The supporting regional emissions analysis for any conformity determination made with respect to a transportation plan, program, or project shall <!-- PDFPage:5466 -->consider the effect on emissions of any such project funded, approved, or implemented prior to the conformity determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, on the Administrator's own motion or by petition from the Governor of any State, the Administrator has reason to believe that the interstate transport of air pollutants from one or more States contributes significantly to a violation of a national ambient air quality standard in one or more other States, the Administrator may establish, by rule, a transport region for such pollutant that includes such States. The Administrator, on the Administrator's own motion or upon petition from the Governor of any State, or upon the recommendation of a transport commission established under subsection (b) of this section, may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) add any State or portion of a State to any region established under this subsection whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that the interstate transport of air pollutants from such State significantly contributes to a violation of the standard in the transport region, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) remove any State or portion of a State from the region whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that the control of emis<!-- PDFPage:5467 -->sions in that State or portion of the State pursuant to this section will not significantly contribute to the attainment of the standard in any area in the region.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Administrator shall approve or disapprove any such petition or recommendation within 18 months of its receipt. The Administrator shall establish appropriate proceedings for public participation regarding such petitions and motions, including notice and comment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transport commissions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever the Administrator establishes a transport region under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall establish a transport commission comprised of (at a minimum) each of the following members:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The Governor of each State in the region or the designee of each such Governor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Administrator or the Administrator's designee.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The transport commission shall assess the degree of interstate transport of the pollutant or precursors to the pollutant throughout the transport region, assess strategies for mitigating the interstate pollution, and recommend to the Administrator such measures as the Commission determines to be necessary to ensure that the plans for the relevant States meet the requirements of section 7410(a)(2)(D) of this title. Such commission shall not be subject to the provisions of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App.).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Commission requests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A transport commission established under subsection (b) of this section may request the Administrator to issue a finding under section 7410(k)(5) of this title that the implementation plan for one or more of the States in the transport region is substantially inadequate to meet the requirements of section 7410(a)(2)(D) of this title. The Administrator shall approve, disapprove, or partially approve and partially disapprove such a request within 18 months of its receipt and, to the extent the Administrator approves such request, issue the finding under section 7410(k)(5) of this title at the time of such approval. In acting on such request, the Administrator shall provide an opportunity for public participation and shall address each specific recommendation made by the commission. Approval or disapproval of such a request shall constitute final agency action within the meaning of section 7607(b) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State failure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any implementation plan or plan revision required under this part (or required in response <!-- PDFPage:5468 -->to a finding of substantial inadequacy as described in section 7410(k)(5) of this title), if the Administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) finds that a State has failed, for an area designated nonattainment under section 7407(d) of this title, to submit a plan, or to submit 1 or more of the elements (as determined by the Administrator) required by the provisions of this chapter applicable to such an area, or has failed to make a submission for such an area that satisfies the minimum criteria established in relation to any such element under section 7410(k) of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) disapproves a submission under section 7410(k) of this title, for an area designated nonattainment under section 7407 of this title, based on the submission's failure to meet one or more of the elements required by the provisions of this chapter applicable to such an area,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) disapproves in whole or in part a submission described under subparagraph (A), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) finds that any requirement of an approved plan (or approved part of a plan) is not being implemented,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless such deficiency has been corrected within 18 months after the finding, disapproval, or determination referred to in paragraphs (1), (2), (3), and (4), one of the sanctions referred to in subsection (b) of this section shall apply, as selected by the Administrator, until the Administrator determines that the State has come into compliance, except that if the Administrator finds a lack of good faith, sanctions under both paragraph (1) and paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section shall apply until the Administrator determines that the State has come into compliance. If the Administrator has selected one of such sanctions and the deficiency has not been corrected within 6 months thereafter, sanctions under both paragraph (1) and paragraph (2) of subsection (b) of this section shall apply until the Administrator determines that the State has come into compliance. In addition to any other sanction applicable as provided in this section, the Administrator may withhold all or part of the grants for support of air pollution planning and control programs that the Administrator may award under section 7405 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The sanctions available to the Administrator as provided in subsection (a) of this section are as follows:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Highway sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Administrator may impose a prohibition, applicable to a nonattainment area, on the approval by the Secretary of Transportation of any projects or the awarding by the Secretary of any grants, under title 23 other than projects or grants for safety where the Secretary determines, based on accident or other appropriate data submitted by the State, that the principal purpose of the project is an improvement in safety to resolve a demonstrated safety problem and likely will result in a significant reduction in, or avoidance of, accidents. Such prohibition shall become effective upon the selection by the Administrator of this sanction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In addition to safety, projects or grants that may be approved by the Secretary, notwithstanding the prohibition in subparagraph (A), are the following&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) capital programs for public transit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) construction or restriction of certain roads or lanes solely for the use of passenger buses or high occupancy vehicles;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) planning for requirements for employers to reduce employee work-trip-related vehicle emissions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) highway ramp metering, traffic signalization, and related programs that improve traffic flow and achieve a net emission reduction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) fringe and transportation corridor parking facilities serving multiple occupancy vehicle programs or transit operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) programs to limit or restrict vehicle use in downtown areas or other areas of emission concentration particularly during periods of peak use, through road use charges, tolls, parking surcharges, or other pricing mechanisms, vehicle restricted zones or periods, or vehicle registration programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) programs for breakdown and accident scene management, nonrecurring congestion, and vehicle information systems, to reduce congestion and emissions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(viii) such other transportation-related programs as the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, finds would improve air quality and would not encourage single occupancy vehicle capacity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In considering such measures, the State should seek to ensure adequate access to downtown, other commercial, and residential areas, and avoid increasing or relocating emissions and congestion rather than reducing them.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Offsets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying the emissions offset requirements of section 7503 of this title to new or modified sources or emissions units for which a permit is required under this part, the ratio of emission reductions to increased emissions shall be at least 2 to 1.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice of failure to attain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) As expeditiously as practicable after the applicable attainment date for any nonattainment area, but not later than 6 months after such date, the Administrator shall determine, based on the area's air quality as of the attainment date, whether the area attained the standard by that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon making the determination under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall publish a <!-- PDFPage:5469 -->notice in the Federal Register containing such determination and identifying each area that the Administrator has determined to have failed to attain. The Administrator may revise or supplement such determination at any time based on more complete information or analysis concerning the area's air quality as of the attainment date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Consequences for failure to attain</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 1 year after the Administrator publishes the notice under subsection (c)(2) of this section (relating to notice of failure to attain), each State containing a nonattainment area shall submit a revision to the applicable implementation plan meeting the requirements of paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The revision required under paragraph (1) shall meet the requirements of section 7410 of this title and section 7502 of this title. In addition, the revision shall include such additional measures as the Administrator may reasonably prescribe, including all measures that can be feasibly implemented in the area in light of technological achievability, costs, and any nonair quality and other air quality-related health and environmental impacts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The attainment date applicable to the revision required under paragraph (1) shall be the same as provided in the provisions of section 7502(a)(2) of this title, except that in applying such provisions the phrase &ldquo;from the date of the notice under section 7509(c)(2) of this title&rdquo; shall be substituted for the phrase &ldquo;from the date such area was designated nonattainment under section 7407(d) of this title&rdquo; and for the phrase &ldquo;from the date of designation as nonattainment&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Establishment of Program To Monitor and Improve Air Quality in Regions Along Border Between United States and Mexico</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 815 of Pub. L. 101&ndash;549 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter referred to as the &lsquo;Administrator&rsquo;) is authorized, in cooperation with the Department of State and the affected States, to negotiate with representatives of Mexico to authorize a program to monitor and improve air quality in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. The program established under this section shall not extend beyond July 1, 1995.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring and Remediation.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Monitoring</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The monitoring component of the program conducted under this section shall identify and determine sources of pollutants for which national ambient air quality standards (hereinafter referred to as &lsquo;NAAQS&rsquo;) and other air quality goals have been established in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. Any such monitoring component of the program shall include, but not be limited to, the collection of meteorological data, the measurement of air quality, the compilation of an emissions inventory, and shall be sufficient to the extent necessary to successfully support the use of a state-of-the-art mathematical air modeling analysis. Any such monitoring component of the program shall collect and produce data projecting the level of emission reductions necessary in both Mexico and the United States to bring about attainment of both primary and secondary NAAQS, and other air <!-- PDFPage:5470 -->quality goals, in regions along the border in the United States. Any such monitoring component of the program shall include to the extent possible, data from monitoring programs undertaken by other parties.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Remediation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator is authorized to negotiate with appropriate representatives of Mexico to develop joint remediation measures to reduce the level of airborne pollutants to achieve and maintain primary and secondary NAAQS, and other air quality goals, in regions along the border between the United States and Mexico. Such joint remediation measures may include, but not be limited to measures included in the Environmental Protection Agency's Control Techniques and Control Technology documents. Any such remediation program shall also identify those control measures implementation of which in Mexico would be expedited by the use of material and financial assistance of the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Annual Reports</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall, each year the program authorized in this section is in operation, report to Congress on the progress of the program in bringing nonattainment areas along the border of the United States into attainment with primary and secondary NAAQS. The report issued by the Administrator under this paragraph shall include recommendations on funding mechanisms to assist in implementation of monitoring and remediation efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Funding and Personnel</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may, where appropriate, make available, subject to the appropriations, such funds, personnel, and equipment as may be necessary to implement the provisions of this section. In those cases where direct financial assistance of the United States is provided to implement monitoring and remediation programs in Mexico, the Administrator shall develop grant agreements with appropriate representatives of Mexico to assure the accuracy and completeness of monitoring data and the performance of remediation measures which are financed by the United States. With respect to any control measures within Mexico funded by the United States, the Administrator shall, to the maximum extent practicable, utilize resources of Mexico where such utilization would reduce costs to the United States. Such funding agreements shall include authorization for the Administrator to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) review and agree to plans for monitoring and remediation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) inspect premises, equipment and records to insure compliance with the agreements established under and the purposes set forth in this section; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) where necessary, develop grant agreements with affected States to carry out the provisions of this section.&rdquo;</p>
