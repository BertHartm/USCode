<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President shall submit to the Congress, within four years after December 11, 1980, a comprehensive report on experience with the implementation of this chapter including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the extent to which the chapter and Fund are effective in enabling Government to respond to and mitigate the effects of releases of hazardous substances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a summary of past receipts and disbursements from the Fund;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a projection of any future funding needs remaining after the expiration of authority to collect taxes, and of the threat to public health, welfare, and the environment posed by the projected releases which create any such needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the record and experience of the Fund in recovering Fund disbursements from liable parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the record of State participation in the system of response, liability, and compensation established by this chapter;</p>

In preparing the report, the President shall consult with appropriate Federal, State, and local agencies, affected industries and claimants, and such other interested parties as he may find useful. Based upon the analyses and consultation required by this subsection, the President shall also include in the report any recommendations for legislative changes he may deem necessary for the better effectuation of the purposes of this chapter, including but not limited to recommendations concerning authorization levels, taxes, State participation, liability and liability limits, and financial responsibility provisions for the Response Trust Fund and the Post-closure Liability Trust Fund;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:5185 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Such regulations shall specify (A) standard procedures for simplified assessments requiring minimal field observation, including establishing measures of damages based on units of discharge or release or units of affected area, and (B) alternative protocols for conducting assessments in individual cases to determine the type and extent of short- and long-term injury, destruction, or loss.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the scope of the evidentiary burdens placed on the plaintiff in proving harm from the release of hazardous substances, particularly in light of the scientific uncertainty over causation with respect to&mdash;</p>
