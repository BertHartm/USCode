<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Imposition of monthly premium; persons affected; amount; prepayment; failure to pay; use of funds from other programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State plan of a State may at the option of the State provide for imposing a monthly premium (in an amount that does not exceed the limit established under paragraph (2)) with respect to an individual described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 1396a(<em>l</em>)(1) of this title who is receiving medical assistance on the basis of section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX) of this title and whose family income (as determined in accordance with the methodology specified in section 1396a(<em>l</em>)(3) of this title) equals or exceeds 150 percent of the income official poverty line (as defined by the Office of Management and Budget, and revised annually in accordance with section 9902(2) of this title) applicable to a family of the size involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In no case may the amount of any premium imposed under paragraph (1) exceed 10 percent of the amount by which the family income (less expenses for the care of a dependent child) of an individual exceeds 150 percent of the line described in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A State shall not require prepayment of a premium imposed pursuant to paragraph (1) and shall not terminate eligibility of an individual for medical assistance under this subchapter on the basis of failure to pay any such premium until such failure continues for a period of not less than 60 days. The State may waive payment of any such premium in any case where the State determines that requiring such payment would create an undue hardship.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A State may permit State or local funds available under other programs to be used for payment of a premium imposed under paragraph (1). Payment of a premium with such funds shall not be counted as income to the individual with respect to whom such payment is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Premiums for qualified disabled and working individuals described in section 1396d(s)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a qualified disabled and working individual described in section 1396d(s) of this title whose income (as determined under paragraph (3) of that section) exceeds 150 percent of the official poverty line referred to in that paragraph, the State plan of a State may provide for the charging of a premium (expressed as a percentage of the medicare cost-sharing described in section 1396d(p)(3)(A)(i) of this title provided with respect to the individual) according to a sliding scale under which such percentage increases from 0 percent to 100 percent, in reasonable increments (as determined by the Secretary), as the individual's income increases from 150 percent of such poverty line to 200 percent of such poverty line.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition of denial of services on basis of individual's inability to pay certain charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State plan shall require that no provider participating under the State plan may deny care or services to an individual eligible for such care or services under the plan on account of such individual's inability to pay a deduction, cost sharing, or similar charge. The requirements of this subsection shall not extinguish the liability of the individual to whom the care or <!-- PDFPage:2346 -->services were furnished for payment of the deduction, cost sharing, or similar charge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Charges imposed under waiver authority of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No deduction, cost sharing, or similar charge may be imposed under any waiver authority of the Secretary, except as provided in subsections (a)(3) and (b)(3) of this section, unless such waiver is for a demonstration project which the Secretary finds after public notice and opportunity for comment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) will test a unique and previously untested use of copayments,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is limited to a period of not more than two years,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) will provide benefits to recipients of medical assistance which can reasonably be expected to be equivalent to the risks to the recipients,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) is based on a reasonable hypothesis which the demonstration is designed to test in a methodologically sound manner, including the use of control groups of similar recipients of medical assistance in the area, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) is voluntary, or makes provision for assumption of liability for preventable damage to the health of recipients of medical assistance resulting from involuntary participation.</p>
