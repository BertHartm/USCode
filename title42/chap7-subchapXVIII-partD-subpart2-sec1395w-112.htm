Such a contract with a sponsor may cover more than one prescription drug plan.

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Clean claim defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;clean claim&rdquo; means a claim that has no defect or impropriety (including any lack of any required substantiating documentation) or particular circumstance requiring special treatment that prevents timely payment from being made on the claim under this part.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Date of receipt of claim</h4>

Interest amounts paid under this subparagraph shall not be counted against the administrative costs of a prescription drug plan or treated as allowable risk corridor costs under section 1395w&ndash;115(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Authority not to charge interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may provide that a PDP sponsor is not charged interest under clause (i) in the case where there are exigent circumstances, including natural disasters and other unique and unexpected events, that prevent the timely processing of claims.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Procedures involving claims</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Claim deemed to be clean</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A claim is deemed to be a clean claim if the PDP sponsor involved does not provide notice to the claimant of any deficiency in the claim&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) with respect to claims submitted electronically, within 10 days after the date on which the claim is received; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) with respect to claims submitted otherwise, within 15 days after the date on which the claim is received.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Claim determined to not be a clean claim</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">If a PDP sponsor determines that a submitted claim is not a clean claim, the PDP sponsor shall, not later than the end of the period described in clause (i), notify the claimant of such determination. Such notification shall specify all defects or improprieties in the claim and shall list all additional information or documents necessary for the proper processing and payment of the claim.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Determination after submission of additional information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">A claim is deemed to be a clean claim under this paragraph if the PDP sponsor involved does not provide notice to the claimant of any defect or impropriety in the claim within 10 days of the date on which additional information is received under subclause (I).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Obligation to pay</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A claim submitted to a PDP sponsor that is not paid or contested by the sponsor within the applicable number of days (as defined in subparagraph (B)) after the date on which the claim is received shall be deemed to be a clean claim and shall be paid by the PDP sponsor in accordance with subparagraph (A).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Protecting the rights of claimants</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A determination under this paragraph that a claim submitted by a pharmacy is a clean claim shall not be construed as a positive determination regarding eligibility for payment under this subchapter, nor is it an indication of government approval of, or acquiescence regarding, the claim submitted. The determination shall not relieve any party of civil or criminal liability with respect to the claim, nor does it offer a defense to any administrative, civil, or criminal action with respect to the claim.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2493 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Submission of claims by pharmacies located in or contracting with long-term care facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each contract entered into with a PDP sponsor under this part with respect to a prescription drug plan offered by such sponsor shall provide that a pharmacy located in, or having a contract with, a long-term care facility shall have not less than 30 days (but not more than 90 days) to submit claims to the sponsor for reimbursement under the plan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorizing waiver</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an entity that seeks to offer a prescription drug plan in a State, the Secretary shall waive the requirement of subsection (a)(1) of this section that the entity be licensed in that State if the Secretary determines, based on the application and other evidence presented to the Secretary, that any of the grounds for approval of the application described in paragraph (2) have been met.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application of regional plan waiver rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to the waiver available under subparagraph (A), the provisions of section 1395w&ndash;27a(d) of this title shall apply to PDP sponsors under this part in a manner similar to the manner in which such provisions apply to MA organizations under part C of this subchapter, except that no application shall be required under paragraph (1)(B) of such section in the case of a State that does not provide a licensing process for such a sponsor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Grounds for approval</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying subparagraph (A)(i)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the ground of approval described in section 1395w&ndash;25(a)(2)(B) of this title is deemed to have been met if the State does not have a licensing process in effect with respect to the PDP sponsor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for plan years beginning before January 1, 2008, if the State does have such a licensing process in effect, such ground for approval described in such section is deemed to have been met upon submission of an application described in such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Application of waiver procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to an application for a waiver (or a waiver granted) under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection, the provisions of subparagraphs (E), (F), and (G) of section 1395w&ndash;25(a)(2) of this title shall apply, except that clauses (i) and (ii) of such subparagraph (E) shall not apply in the case of a State that does not have a licensing process described in paragraph (2)(B)(i) in effect.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) References to certain provisions</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any reference to a waiver application under section 1395w&ndash;25 of this title shall be treated as a reference to a waiver application under paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment and publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, shall establish and publish, by not later than January 1, 2005, financial solvency and capital adequacy standards for entities described in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Compliance with standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A PDP sponsor that is not licensed by a State under subsection (a)(1) of this section and for which a waiver application has been approved under subsection (c) of this section shall meet solvency and capital adequacy standards established under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall establish certification procedures for such sponsors with respect to such solvency standards in the manner described in section 1395w&ndash;25(c)(2) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Licensure does not substitute for or constitute certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The fact that a PDP sponsor is licensed in accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section or has a waiver application approved under subsection (c) of this section does not deem the sponsor to meet other requirements imposed under this part for a sponsor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Periodic review and revision of standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may periodically review the standards established under this section and, based on such review, may revise such standards if the Secretary determines such revision to be appropriate.</p>
