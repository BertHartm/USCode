<h3 class="section-head">&sect;300aa&ndash;13. Determination of eligibility and compensation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Compensation shall be awarded under the Program to a petitioner if the special master or court finds on the record as a whole&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the petitioner has demonstrated by a preponderance of the evidence the matters required in the petition by section 300aa&ndash;11(c)(1) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that there is not a preponderance of the evidence that the illness, disability, injury, condition, or death described in the petition is due to factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine described in the petition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The special master or court may not make such a finding based on the claims of a petitioner alone, unsubstantiated by medical records or by medical opinion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;factors unrelated to the administration of the vaccine&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) does not include any idiopathic, unexplained, unknown, hypothetical, or undocumentable cause, factor, injury, illness, or condition, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may, as documented by the petitioner's evidence or other material in the record, include infection, toxins, trauma (including birth trauma and related anoxia), or metabolic disturbances which have no known relation to the vaccine involved, but which in the particular case are shown to have been the agent or agents principally responsible for causing the petitioner's illness, disability, injury, condition, or death.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Matters to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In determining whether to award compensation to a petitioner under the Program, the special master or court shall consider, in addition to all other relevant medical and scientific evidence contained in the record&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any diagnosis, conclusion, medical judgment, or autopsy or coroner's report which is contained in the record regarding the nature, causation, and aggravation of the petitioner's illness, disability, injury, condition, or death, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the results of any diagnostic or evaluative test which are contained in the record and the summaries and conclusions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any such diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, or summary shall not be binding on the special master or court. In evaluating the weight to be afforded to any such diagnosis, conclusion, judgment, test result, report, or summary, the special master or court shall consider the entire record and the course of the injury, disability, illness, or condition until the date of the judgment of the special master or court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The special master or court may find the first symptom or manifestation of onset or significant aggravation of an injury, disability, illness, condition, or death described in a petition occurred within the time period described in the Vaccine Injury Table even though the occurrence of such symptom or manifestation was not recorded or was incorrectly recorded as having occurred outside such period. Such a finding may be made only upon demonstration by a preponderance of the evidence that the onset or significant aggravation of the injury, disability, illness, condition, or death described in the petition did in fact occur within the time period described in the Vaccine Injury Table.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Record&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;record&rdquo; means the record established by the special masters of the United States Court of <!-- PDFPage:1018 -->Federal Claims in a proceeding on a petition filed under section 300aa&ndash;11 of this title.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1019 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Qualifications and aids to interpretation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The following qualifications and aids to interpretation shall apply to the Vaccine Injury Table in subsection (a) of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A shock-collapse or a hypotonic-hyporesponsive collapse may be evidenced by indicia or symptoms such as decrease or loss of muscle tone, paralysis (partial or complete), hemiplegia or hemiparesis, loss of color or turning pale white or blue, unresponsiveness to environmental stimuli, depression of consciousness, loss of consciousness, prolonged sleeping with difficulty arousing, or cardiovascular or respiratory arrest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A petitioner may be considered to have suffered a residual seizure disorder if the petitioner did not suffer a seizure or convulsion unaccompanied by fever or accompanied by a fever of less than 102 degrees Fahrenheit before the first seizure or convulsion after the administration of the vaccine involved and if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a measles, mumps, or rubella vaccine or any combination of such vaccines, the first seizure or convulsion occurred within 15 days after administration of the vaccine and 2 or more seizures or convulsions occurred within 1 year after the administration of the vaccine which were unaccompanied by fever or accompanied by a fever of less than 102 degrees Fahrenheit, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any other vaccine, the first seizure or convulsion occurred within 3 days after administration of the vaccine and 2 or more seizures or convulsions occurred within 1 year after the administration of the vaccine which were unaccompanied by fever or accompanied by a fever of less than 102 degrees Fahrenheit.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The term &ldquo;encephalopathy&rdquo; means any significant acquired abnormality of, or injury to, or impairment of function of the brain. Among the frequent manifestations of encephalopathy are focal and diffuse neurologic signs, increased intracranial pressure, or changes lasting at least 6 hours in level of consciousness, with or without convulsions. The neurological signs and symptoms of encephalopathy may be temporary with complete recovery, or may result in various degrees of permanent impairment. Signs and symptoms such as high pitched and unusual screaming, persistent unconsolable crying, and bulging fontanel are compatible with an encephalopathy, but in and of themselves are not conclusive evidence of encephalopathy. Encephalopathy usually can be documented by slow wave activity on an electroencephalogram.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If in a proceeding on a petition it is shown by a preponderance of the evidence that an encephalopathy was caused by infection, toxins, trauma, or metabolic disturbances the encephalopathy shall not be considered to be a condition set forth in the table. If at the time a judgment is entered on a petition filed under section 300aa&ndash;11 of this title for a vaccine-related injury or death it is not possible to determine the cause, by a preponderance of the evidence, of an encephalopathy, the encephalopathy shall be considered to be a condition set forth in the table. In determining whether or not an encephalopathy is a condition set forth in the table, the court shall consider the entire medical record.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), the terms &ldquo;seizure&rdquo; and &ldquo;convulsion&rdquo; include grand mal, petit mal, absence, myoclonic, tonic-clonic, and focal motor seizures and signs. If a provision of the table to which paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) applies is revised under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, such paragraph shall not apply to such provision after the effective date of the revision unless the revision specifies that such paragraph is to continue to apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative revision of table</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may promulgate regulations to modify in accordance with paragraph (3) the Vaccine Injury Table. In promulgating such regulations, the Secretary shall provide for notice and opportunity for a public hearing and at least 180 days of public comment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person (including the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines) may petition the Secretary to propose regulations to amend the Vaccine Injury Table. Unless clearly frivolous, or initiated by the Commission, any such petition shall be referred to the Commission for its recommendations. Following&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) receipt of any recommendation of the Commission, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 180 days after the date of the referral to the Commission,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever occurs first, the Secretary shall conduct a rulemaking proceeding on the matters proposed in the petition or publish in the Federal Register a statement of reasons for not conducting such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A modification of the Vaccine Injury Table under paragraph (1) may add to, or delete from, the list of injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths for which compensation may be provided or may change the time periods for the first symptom or manifestation of the onset or the significant aggravation of any such injury, disability, illness, condition, or death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any modification under paragraph (1) of the Vaccine Injury Table shall apply only with respect to petitions for compensation under the Program which are filed after the effective date of such regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Role of Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except with respect to a regulation recommended by the Advisory Commission on Childhood Vaccines, the Secretary may not propose a regulation under subsection (c) of this section or any revision thereof, unless the Secretary has first provided to the Commission a copy of the proposed regulation or revision, requested recommendations and comments by the Commission, and afforded the Commission at least 90 days to make such recommendations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Additional vaccines</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Vaccines recommended before August 1, 1993</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">By August 1, 1995, the Secretary shall revise the Vaccine Injury Table included in subsection (a) of this section to include&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1020 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) vaccines which are recommended to the Secretary by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before August 1, 1993, for routine administration to children,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths associated with such vaccines, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the time period in which the first symptoms or manifestations of onset or other significant aggravation of such injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths associated with such vaccines may occur.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Vaccines recommended after August 1, 1993</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When after August 1, 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a vaccine to the Secretary for routine administration to children, the Secretary shall, within 2 years of such recommendation, amend the Vaccine Injury Table included in subsection (a) of this section to include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) vaccines which were recommended for routine administration to children,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths associated with such vaccines, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the time period in which the first symptoms or manifestations of onset or other significant aggravation of such injuries, disabilities, illnesses, conditions, and deaths associated with such vaccines may occur.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) No vaccine manufacturer shall be liable in a civil action for damages arising from a vaccine-related injury or death associated with the administration of a vaccine after October 1, 1988, if the injury or death resulted from side effects that were unavoidable even though the vaccine was properly prepared and was accompanied by proper directions and warnings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a vaccine shall be presumed to be accompanied by proper directions and warnings if the vaccine manufacturer shows that it complied in all material respects with all requirements under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] and section 262 of this title (including regulations issued under such provisions) applicable to the vaccine and related to vaccine-related injury or death for which the civil action was brought unless the plaintiff shows&mdash;</p>
