To the extent practicable, such standards shall be consistent with the administrative simplification provisions of part C of title XI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1320d et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Information reported to and among the network of patient safety databases under subsection (a) of this section shall be used to analyze national and regional statistics, including trends and patterns of health care errors.
