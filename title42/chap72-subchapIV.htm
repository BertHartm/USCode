<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) each year thousands of children are abducted or removed from the control of a parent having legal custody without such parent's consent, under circumstances which immediately place them in grave danger;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) many of these children are never reunited with their families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) often there are no clues to the whereabouts of these children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) many missing children are at great risk of both physical harm and sexual exploitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in many cases, parents and local law enforcement officials have neither the resources nor the expertise to mount expanded search efforts;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4135 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) abducted children are frequently moved from one locality to another, requiring the cooperation and coordination of local, State, and Federal law enforcement efforts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) on frequent occasions, law enforcement authorities quickly exhaust all leads in missing children cases, and require assistance from distant communities where the child may be located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Federal assistance is urgently needed to coordinate and assist in this interstate problem.</p>
