<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) juveniles accounted for almost half the arrests for serious crimes in the United States <!-- PDFPage:3869 -->in 1974 and for less than one-third of such arrests in 1983;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) recent trends show an upsurge in arrests of adolescents for murder, assault, and weapon use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the small number of youth who commit the most serious and violent offenses are becoming more violent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) understaffed, overcrowded juvenile courts, prosecutorial and public defender offices, probation services, and correctional facilities and inadequately trained staff in such courts, services, and facilities are not able to provide individualized justice or effective help;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) present juvenile courts, foster and protective care programs, and shelter facilities are inadequate to meet the needs of children, who, because of this failure to provide effective services, may become delinquents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) existing programs have not adequately responded to the particular problems of the increasing numbers of young people who are addicted to or who abuse alcohol and other drugs, particularly nonopiate or polydrug abusers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) juvenile delinquency can be reduced through programs designed to keep students in elementary and secondary schools through the prevention of unwarranted and arbitrary suspensions and expulsions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) States and local communities which experience directly the devastating failures of the juvenile justice system do not presently have sufficient technical expertise or adequate resources to deal comprehensively with the problems of juvenile delinquency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) existing Federal programs have not provided the direction, coordination, resources, and leadership required to meet the crisis of delinquency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) the juvenile justice system should give additional attention to the problem of juveniles who commit serious crimes, with particular attention given to the areas of sentencing, providing resources necessary for informed dispositions, and rehabilitation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) emphasis should be placed on preventing youth from entering the juvenile justice system to begin with; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) the incidence of juvenile delinquency can be reduced through public recreation programs and activities designed to provide youth with social skills, enhance self esteem, and encourage the constructive use of discretionary time.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Congress finds further that the high incidence of delinquency in the United States today results in enormous annual cost and immeasurable loss of human life, personal security, and wasted human resources and that juvenile delinquency constitutes a growing threat to the national welfare requiring immediate and comprehensive action by the Federal Government to reduce and prevent delinquency.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In accordance with guidelines established by the Administrator, each application for assistance under this part shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) set forth a program for carrying out one or more of the purposes set forth in this part and specifically identify each such purpose such program is designed to carry out;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Factors considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining whether or not to approve applications for grants and for contracts under this part, the Administrator shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the relative cost and effectiveness of the proposed program in carrying out this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which such program will incorporate new or innovative techniques;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if a State plan has been approved by the Administrator under section 5633(c) of this title, the extent to which such program meets the objectives and priorities of the State plan, taking into consideration the location and scope of such program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the increase in capacity of the public and private agency, institution, or individual involved to provide services to address juvenile delinquency and juvenile delinquency prevention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the extent to which such program serves communities which have high rates of juvenile unemployment, school dropout, and delinquency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the adverse impact that may result from the restriction of eligibility, based upon population, for cities with a population greater than 40,000 located within States which have no city with a population over 250,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Competitive selection process; review of proposed programs; expedited consideration of proposed programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Programs selected for assistance through grants or contracts under this part (other than section 5651(f) of this title) shall be selected through a competitive process to be established by rule by the Administrator. As part of such a process, the Administrator shall announce in the Federal Register&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the availability of funds for such assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the general criteria applicable to the selection of applicants to receive such assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a description of the procedures applicable to submitting and reviewing applications for such assistance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The competitive process described in subparagraph (A) shall not be required if the Administrator makes a written determination waiving the competitive process&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to programs to be carried out in areas with respect to which the President declares under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.) that a major disaster or emergency exists; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to a particular program described in this part that is uniquely qualified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Programs selected for assistance through grants or contracts under this part (other than section 5651(f) of this title) shall be reviewed before selection, and thereafter as appropriate, through a formal peer review process utilizing experts (other than officers and employees of the Department of Justice) in fields related to the subject matter of the proposed program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such process shall be established by the Administrator in consultation with the Directors and other appropriate officials of the National Science Foundation and the National Institute of Mental Health. Before implementation of such process, the Administrator shall submit such process to such Directors, each of whom shall prepare and furnish to the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate a final report containing their comments on such process as proposed to be established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator, in establishing the processes required under paragraphs (1) and (2), shall provide for emergency expedited consideration of the proposed programs if necessary to avoid any delay which would preclude carrying out such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) City population not basis for denial</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A city shall not be denied assistance under this part solely on the basis of its population.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transmission of notification to Committee chairmen</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notification of grants and contracts made under this part (and the applications submitted for such grants and contracts) shall, upon being made, be transmitted by the Administrator,<sup><a href="#5665a_1_target" name="5665a_1">1</a></sup> to <!-- PDFPage:3905 -->the chairman of the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;case review system&rdquo; means a procedure for ensuring that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each youth has a case plan, based on the use of objective criteria for determining a youth's danger to the community or himself or herself, that is designed to achieve appropriate placement in the least restrictive and most family-like setting available in close proximity to the parents&rsquo; home, consistent with the best interests and special needs of the youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the status of each youth is reviewed periodically but not less frequently than once every 3 months, by a court or by administrative review, in order to determine the continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with respect to each youth, procedural safeguards will be applied to ensure that a dispositional hearing is held to consider the future status of each youth under State supervision, in a juvenile or family court or another court (including a tribal court) of competent jurisdiction, or by an administrative body appointed or approved by the court, not later than 12 months after the original placement of the youth and periodically thereafter during the continuation of out-of-home placement; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3909 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) a youth's health, mental health, and education record is reviewed and updated periodically; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Developing and adopting policies and programs to provide access to counsel for all juveniles in the justice system to ensure that juveniles consult with counsel before waiving the right to counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Increasing community-based alternatives to incarceration by establishing programs (such as expanded use of probation, mediation, restitution, community service, treatment, home detention, intensive supervision, and electronic monitoring) and developing and adopting a set of objective criteria for the appropriate placement of juveniles in detention and secure confinement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Developing and adopting policies and programs to provide secure settings for the placement of violent juvenile offenders by closing down traditional training schools and replacing them with secure settings with capacities of no more than 50 violent juvenile offenders with ratios of staff to youth great enough to ensure adequate supervision and treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Developing and adopting policies to prohibit gender bias in placement and treatment and establishing programs to ensure that female youth have access to the full range of health and mental health services, treatment for physical or sexual assault and abuse, self defense instruction, education in parenting, education in general, and other training and vocational services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Establishing and operating, either directly or by contract or arrangement with a public agency or other appropriate private nonprofit organization (other than an agency or organization that is responsible for licensing or certifying out-of-home care services for youth), a State ombudsman office for children, youth, and families to investigate and resolve complaints relating to action, inaction, or decisions of providers of out-of-home care to children and youth (including secure detention and correctional facilities, residential care facilities, public agencies, and social service agencies) that may adversely affect the health, safety, welfare, or rights of resident children and youth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Developing and adopting policies and programs designed to remove, where appropriate, status offenders from the jurisdiction of the juvenile court to prevent the placement in secure detention facilities or secure correctional facilities of juveniles who are nonoffenders or who are charged with or who have committed offenses that would not be criminal if committed by an adult.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Developing and adopting policies and programs designed to serve as alternatives to suspension and expulsion from school.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Increasing aftercare services for juveniles involved in the justice system by establishing programs and developing and adopting policies to provide comprehensive health, mental health, education, and vocational services and services that preserve and strengthen the families of such juveniles.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) juveniles who have become homeless or who leave and remain away from home without parental permission, are at risk of developing serious health and other problems because they lack sufficient resources to obtain care and may live on the street for extended periods thereby endangering themselves and creating a substantial law enforcement problem for communities in which they congregate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the exact nature of the problem is not well defined because national statistics on the size and profile of the runaway youth population are not tabulated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) many such young people, because of their age and situation, are urgently in need of temporary shelter and counseling services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the problem of locating, detaining, and returning runaway children should not be the responsibility of already overburdened police departments and juvenile justice authorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) in view of the interstate nature of the problem, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to develop accurate reporting of the problem nationally and to develop an effective system of care (including preventive services, emergency shelter services, and extended residential shelter) outside the welfare system and the law enforcement system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) runaway and homeless youth have a disproportionate share of health, behavioral, and emotional problems compared to the general population of youth, but have less access to health care and other appropriate services and therefore may need access to longer periods of residential care, more intensive aftercare service, and other assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to make a successful transition to adulthood, runaway youth, homeless youth, and other street youth need opportunities to complete high school or earn a general equivalency degree, learn job skills, and obtain employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in view of the interstate nature of the problem, it is the responsibility of the Federal Government to develop an accurate national reporting system and to develop an effective system of care including prevention, emergency shelter services, and longer residential care outside the public welfare and law enforcement structures;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3919 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) early intervention services (such as home-based services) are needed to prevent runaway and homeless youth from becoming involved in the juvenile justice system and other law enforcement systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) street-based services that target runaway and homeless youth where they congregate are needed to reach youth who require assistance but who would not otherwise avail themselves of such assistance or services without street-based outreach.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) often there are no clues to the whereabouts of these children;</p>
