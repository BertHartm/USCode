<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Annual determination of reported cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State shall annually determine the rate of reported cases of AIDS as a result of perinatal transmission among residents of the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Causes of perinatal transmission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the rate under subsection (a) of this section, a State shall also determine the possible causes of perinatal transmission. Such causes may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the inadequate provision within the State of prenatal counseling and testing in accordance with the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the inadequate provision or utilization within the State of appropriate therapy or failure of such therapy to reduce perinatal transmission of HIV, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that therapy is not available, accessible or offered to mothers; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that available therapy is offered but not accepted by mothers; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) other factors (which may include the lack of prenatal care) determined relevant by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) CDC reporting system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 4 months after May 20, 1996, the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shall develop and implement a system to be used by States to comply with the requirements of subsections (a) and (b) of this section. The Director shall issue guidelines to ensure that the data collected is statistically valid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Determination by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 180 days after the expiration of the 18-month period beginning on the date on which the system is implemented under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a determination of whether it has become a routine practice in the provision of health care in the United States to carry out each of the activities described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of section 300ff&ndash;35 of this title. In making the determination, the Secretary shall consult with the States and with other public or private entities that have knowledge or expertise relevant to the determination.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:873 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Contingent applicability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the determination published in the Federal Register under subsection (d) of this section is that (for purposes of such subsection) the activities involved have become routine practices, paragraph (2) shall apply on and after the expiration of the 18-month period beginning on the date on which the determination is so published.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary shall not make a grant under this part to a State unless the State meets not less than one of the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A 50 percent reduction (or a comparable measure for States with less than 10 cases) in the rate of new cases of AIDS (recognizing that AIDS is a suboptimal proxy for tracking HIV in infants and was selected because such data is universally available) as a result of perinatal transmission as compared to the rate of such cases reported in 1993 (a State may use HIV data if such data is available).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) At least 95 percent of women in the State who have received at least two prenatal visits (consultations) prior to 34 weeks gestation with a health care provider or provider group have been tested for the human immunodeficiency virus.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The State has in effect, in statute or through regulations, the requirements specified in paragraphs (1) through (5) of section 300ff&ndash;35 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation regarding availability of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to an activity described in any of paragraphs (1) through (4) of section 300ff&ndash;35 of this title, the requirements established by a State under this section apply for purposes of this section only to the extent that the following sources of funds are available for carrying out the activity:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Federal funds provided to the State in grants under this part or under section 300ff&ndash;33 of this title, or through other Federal sources under which payments for routine HIV testing, counseling or treatment are an eligible use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Funds that the State or private entities have elected to provide, including through entering into contracts under which health benefits are provided. This section does not require any entity to expend non-Federal funds.</p>
