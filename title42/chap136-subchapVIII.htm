<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be of good character and demonstrate sincere motivation and dedication to law enforcement and public service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director may enter into contracts with individuals, institutions of learning, and government agencies (including State and local police forces) to obtain the services of persons qualified to participate in and contribute to the training process.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Police Corps training authorized in this section is intended to serve as basic law enforcement training but not to exclude further training of participants by the State and local authorities to which they will be assigned. Each State plan approved by the Director under section 14099&nbsp;<sup><a href="#14097_1_target" name="14097_1">1</a></sup> of this title shall include assurances that following completion of a participant's course of education each participant shall receive appropriate additional training by the State or local authority to which the participant is assigned. The time spent by a participant in such additional training, but not the <!-- PDFPage:6363 -->time spent in Police Corps training, shall be counted toward fulfillment of the participant's 4-year service obligation.</p>
