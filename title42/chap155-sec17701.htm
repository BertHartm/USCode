<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds, on this, the 50th anniversary of the establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) NASA is and should remain a multimission agency with a balanced and robust set of core missions in science, aeronautics, and human space flight and exploration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Investment in NASA's programs will promote innovation through research and development, and will improve the competitiveness of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Investment in NASA's programs, like investments in other Federal science and technology activities, is an investment in our future.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Properly structured, NASA's activities can contribute to an improved quality of life, economic vitality, United States leadership in peaceful cooperation with other nations on challenging undertakings in science and technology, national security, and the advancement of knowledge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) NASA should assume a leadership role in a cooperative international Earth observations and research effort to address key research issues associated with climate change and its impacts on the Earth system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) NASA should undertake a program of aeronautical research, development, and where appropriate demonstration activities with the overarching goals of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensuring that the Nation's future air transportation system can handle up to 3 times the current travel demand and incorporate new vehicle types with no degradation in safety or adverse environmental impact on local communities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) protecting the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) promoting the security of the Nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) retaining the leadership of the United States in global aviation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Human and robotic exploration of the solar system will be a significant long-term undertaking of humanity in the 21st century and beyond, and it is in the national interest that the United States should assume a leadership role in a cooperative international exploration initiative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Developing United States human space flight capabilities to allow independent American access to the International Space Station, and to explore beyond low Earth orbit, is a strategically important national imperative, and all prudent steps should thus be taken to bring the Orion Crew Exploration Vehicle and Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle to full operational capability as soon as possible and to ensure the effective development of a United States heavy lift launch capability for missions beyond low Earth orbit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) NASA's scientific research activities have contributed much to the advancement of knowledge, provided societal benefits, and helped train the next generation of scientists and engineers, and those activities should continue to be an important priority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) NASA should make a sustained commitment to a robust long-term technology development activity. Such investments represent the critically important &ldquo;seed corn&rdquo; on which NASA's ability to carry out challenging and productive missions in the future will depend.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) NASA, through its pursuit of challenging and relevant activities, can provide an important stimulus to the next generation to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Commercial activities have substantially contributed to the strength of both the <!-- PDFPage:7531 -->United States space program and the national economy, and the development of a healthy and robust United States commercial space sector should continue to be encouraged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) It is in the national interest for the United States to have an export control policy that protects the national security while also enabling the United States aerospace industry to compete effectively in the global market place and the United States to undertake cooperative programs in science and human space flight in an effective and efficient manner.</p>
