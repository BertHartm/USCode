<p class="statutory-body">The Corporation, in consultation with the Secretary of Education, is authorized to make grants to, and enter into contracts with, institutions of higher education (including a consortium of such institutions), and partnerships comprised of such institutions and of other public or private nonprofit organizations, to pay for the Federal share of the cost of&mdash;</p>
