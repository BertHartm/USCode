<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in consultation with the Secretary of Energy, determines that the available supply of low-enriched uranium and the available stockpiles of uranium of the Department of Energy are insufficient to meet demand in the United States in the following calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notifies Congress of the adjustment not less than 45 days before making the adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Equivalent quantities of low-enriched uranium imports</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The import limitations described in paragraphs (1) and (2) are expressed in terms of uranium containing 4.4 percent uranium-235 and a tails assay of 0.3 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment for other uranium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Imports of low-enriched uranium under paragraphs (1) and (2), including low-enriched uranium obtained under contracts for separative work units, shall count against the import limitations described in such paragraphs in amounts calculated as the quantity of low-enriched uranium containing 4.4 percent uranium-235 necessary to equal the total amount of uranium-235 contained in such imports.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Downblending of other highly enriched uranium</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The downblending of highly enriched uranium not of weapons origin may be counted for purposes of paragraph (2)(B), subject to verification under paragraph (10), if the Secretary of Energy determines that the highly enriched uranium to be downblended poses a risk to the national security of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Equivalent quantities of highly enriched uranium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of determining the additional low-enriched uranium imports allowed under paragraph (2)(B), highly enriched uranium not of weapons origin downblended pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall count as downblended highly enriched uranium of weapons origin in amounts calculated as the quantity of highly enriched uranium containing 90 percent uranium-235 necessary to equal the total amount of uranium-235 contained in the highly enriched uranium not of weapons origin downblended pursuant to subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Termination of import restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this subsection shall terminate on December 31, 2020.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Methods of verification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In conducting the verification required under subparagraph (A), the Secretary of En<!-- PDFPage:4665 -->ergy shall employ the transparency measures and access provisions agreed to under the Russian HEU Agreement for monitoring the downblending of Russian highly enriched uranium of weapons origin and such other methods as the Secretary determines appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Enforcement of import limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Commerce shall be responsible for enforcing the import limitations imposed under this subsection and shall enforce such import limitations in a manner that imposes a minimal burden on the commercial nuclear industry.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(12) Effect on other agreements</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Russian HEU Agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to modify the terms of the Russian HEU Agreement, including the provisions of the Agreement relating to the amount of low-enriched uranium that may be imported into the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Other agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a provision of any agreement between the United States and the Russian Federation, other than the Russian HEU Agreement, relating to the importation of low-enriched uranium, including low-enriched uranium obtained under contracts for separative work units, into the United States conflicts with a provision of this section, the provision of this section shall supersede the provision of the agreement to the extent of the conflict.</p>
