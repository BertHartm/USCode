<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Whenever any employee of the Department knowingly and materially violates the prohibition in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may impose a civil money penalty on the employee in accordance with the provisions of this subsection.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish standards and procedures governing the imposition of civil money penalties under this subsection. The standards and procedures&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of the penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable order.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Objections not raised in hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The court shall not consider any objection that was not raised in the hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph (3)(A) unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection. If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that additional evidence not presented at such hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the court shall remand the matter to the Secretary for consideration of such additional evidence.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Action to collect penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any employee fails to comply with the Secretary's determination or order imposing a civil money penalty under paragraph (1), after the determination or order is no longer subject to review as provided by paragraphs (3)(A) and (4), the Secretary may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in an appropriate United States district court to obtain a monetary judgment against the employee and such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in the court's discretion, include the attorneys&rsquo; fees <!-- PDFPage:3865 -->and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary's determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
