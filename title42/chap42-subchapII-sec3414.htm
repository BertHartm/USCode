<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Discharge of patient and dismissal of proceedings; notice of time and place; service; issues of fact: demand for jury or judicial determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If both examining physicians (referred to in section 3413 of this title) conclude in their respective written reports that the patient is not a narcotic addict, or is an addict not likely to be rehabilitated through treatment, the court shall immediately enter an order discharging the patient and dismissing the proceedings under this <!-- PDFPage:3521 -->subchapter. If the written report of either such physician indicates that the patient is a narcotic addict who is likely to be rehabilitated through treatment, or that the physician submitting the report is unable to reach any conclusion by reason of the refusal of the patient to submit to a thorough examination, the court shall promptly set the case for hearing. The court shall cause a written notice of the time and place of such hearing to be served personally upon the patient and his attorney. Such notice shall also inform the patient that upon demand made by him within fifteen days after he has been served, he shall be entitled to have all issues of fact with respect to his alleged narcotic addiction determined by a jury. If no timely demand for a jury is made, the court, in conducting such hearing, shall determine all issues of fact without a jury.</p>
