<p class="note-body">(a) provide Federal human resources management policy guidance to address Hispanic underrepresentation where it occurs;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3406 --><p class="note-body">(b) take the lead in promoting diversity to executive agencies for such actions as deemed appropriate to promote equal employment opportunity;</p>
