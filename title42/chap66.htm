In establishing the amount of, and the effective date for, such adjustment, the Director, in consultation with the State Commissions on National and Community Service (as established under section 12638 of this title) and the heads of the State offices established under section 12651f of this title, shall consider the effect such adjustment will have on the ability of non-federally funded volunteer programs similar to the programs under this subchapter to maintain their current level of volunteer hours.</p>
