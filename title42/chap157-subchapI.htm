<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualified high risk pool meets the requirements of this paragraph if such pool&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides to all eligible individuals health insurance coverage that does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides health insurance coverage&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in which the issuer's share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under such coverage is not less than 65 percent of such costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that has an out of pocket limit not greater than the applicable amount described in section 223(c)(2) of title 26 for the year involved, except that the Secretary may modify such limit if necessary to ensure the pool meets the actuarial value limit under clause (i);</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Protection against dumping risk by insurers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer or employment-based health plan shall be responsible for reimbursing the program under this section for the medical expenses incurred by the program for an individual who, based on criteria established by the Secretary, the Secretary finds was encouraged by the issuer to disenroll from health benefits coverage prior to enrolling in coverage through the program. The criteria shall include at least the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the case of prior coverage obtained through an employer, the provision by the employer, group health plan, or the issuer of money or other financial consideration for disenrolling from the coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the case of prior coverage obtained directly from an issuer or under an employment-based health plan&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as constituting exclusive remedies for violations of criteria established under paragraph (1) or as preventing States from applying or enforcing such paragraph or other provisions under law with respect to health insurance issuers.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appeals process to enable individuals to appeal a determination under this section; and</p>

Such funds shall be available without fiscal year limitation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Insufficient funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary estimates for any fiscal year that the aggregate amounts available for the payment of the expenses of the high risk pool will be less than the actual amount of such expenses, the Secretary shall make such adjustments as are necessary to eliminate such deficit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), coverage of eligible individuals under a high risk pool in a State shall terminate on January 1, 2014.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transition to Exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall develop procedures to provide for the transition of eligible individuals enrolled in health insurance coverage offered through a high risk pool established under this section into qualified health plans offered through an Exchange. Such procedures shall ensure that there is no lapse in coverage with respect to the individual and may extend coverage after the termination of the risk pool involved, if the Secretary determines necessary to avoid such a lapse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary has the authority to stop taking applications for participation in the program under this section to comply with the funding limitation provided for in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Relation to State laws</h4>

Such payments shall not be used as general revenues for an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i). The Secretary shall develop a mechanism to monitor the appropriate use of such payments by such entities.</p>
