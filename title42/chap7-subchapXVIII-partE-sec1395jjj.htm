<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than January 1, 2012, the Secretary shall establish a shared savings program (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;program&rdquo;) that promotes accountability for a patient population and coordinates items and services under parts A and B, and encourages investment in infrastructure and redesigned care processes for high quality and efficient service delivery. Under such program&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) groups of providers of services and suppliers meeting criteria specified by the Secretary may work together to manage and coordinate care for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries through an accountable care organization (referred to in this section as an &ldquo;ACO&rdquo;); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ACOs that meet quality performance standards established by the Secretary are eligible to receive payments for shared savings under subsection (d)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) clinical processes and outcomes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) patient and, where practicable, caregiver experience of care; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Quality performance standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish quality performance standards to assess the quality of care furnished by ACOs.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Other reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may, as the Secretary determines appropriate, incorporate reporting <!-- PDFPage:3267 -->requirements and incentive payments related to the physician quality reporting initiative (PQRI) under section 1395w&ndash;4 of this title, including such requirements and such payments related to electronic prescribing, electronic health records, and other similar initiatives under section 1395w&ndash;4 of this title, and may use alternative criteria than would otherwise apply under such section for determining whether to make such payments. The incentive payments described in the preceding sentence shall not be taken into consideration when calculating any payments otherwise made under subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No duplication in participation in shared savings programs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the ACO meets the requirement under subparagraph (B)(i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Savings requirement and benchmark</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Determining savings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In each year of the agreement period, an ACO shall be eligible to receive payment for shared savings under paragraph (2) only if the estimated average per capita Medicare expenditures under the ACO for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries for parts A and B services, adjusted for beneficiary characteristics, is at least the percent specified by the Secretary below the applicable benchmark under clause (ii). The Secretary shall determine the appropriate percent described in the preceding sentence to account for normal variation in expenditures under this subchapter, based upon the number of Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries assigned to an ACO.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Establish and update benchmark</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall estimate a benchmark for each agreement period for each ACO using the most recent available 3 years of per-beneficiary expenditures for parts A and B services for Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries assigned to the ACO. Such benchmark shall be adjusted for beneficiary characteristics and such other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate and updated by the projected absolute amount of growth in national per capita expenditures for parts A and B services under the original Medicare fee-for-service program, as estimated by the Secretary. Such benchmark shall be reset at the start of each agreement period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payments for shared savings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to performance with respect to the quality performance standards established by the Secretary under subsection (b)(3), if an ACO meets the requirements under paragraph (1), a percent (as determined appropriate by the Secretary) of the difference between such estimated average per capita Medicare expenditures in a year, adjusted for beneficiary characteristics, under the ACO and such benchmark for the ACO may be paid to the ACO as shared savings and the remainder of such difference shall be retained by the program under this subchapter. The Secretary shall establish limits on the total amount of shared savings that may be paid to an ACO under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Monitoring avoidance of at-risk patients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that an ACO has taken steps to avoid patients at risk in order to reduce the likelihood of increasing costs to the ACO the Secretary may impose an appropriate sanction on the ACO, including termination from the program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may terminate an agreement with an ACO if it does not meet the quality performance standards established by the Secretary under subsection (b)(3).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limitations on review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title, section 1395<em>oo</em> of this title, or otherwise of&mdash;</p>
