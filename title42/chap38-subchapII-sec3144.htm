<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Approval of plans; interest free loans; repayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a redevelopment area prepares a plan for the redevelopment of the area or a part thereof and <!-- PDFPage:3288 -->submits such plan to the Secretary for his approval and the Secretary approves such plan, the Secretary is authorized to make an interest free loan to such area for the purpose of carrying out such plan. Such plan may include industrial land assembly, land banking, acquisition of surplus government property, acquisition of industrial sites including acquisition of abandoned properties with redevelopment potential, real estate development including redevelopment and rehabilitation of historical buildings for industrial and commercial use, rehabilitation and renovation of usable empty factory buildings for industrial and commercial use, and other investments which will accelerate recycling of land and facilities for job creating economic activity. Any such interest free loan shall be made on condition (1) that the area will use such interest free loan to make loans to carry out such plan, (2) the repayment of any loans made by the area from such interest free loan shall be placed by such area in a revolving fund available solely for the making of other loans by the area, upon approval by the Secretary, for the economic redevelopment of the area. Any such interest free loans shall be repaid to the United States by a redevelopment area whenever such area has its designation as a redevelopment area terminated or modified under section 3162 of this title. This section shall not apply to any redevelopment area whose designation as a redevelopment area would be terminated or modified under section 3162 of this title except for the provisions of section 2 of the Act entitled &ldquo;An Act to amend the Public Works and Economic Development Act of 1965 to extend the authorizations for titles I through IV through fiscal year 1971&rdquo;, approved July 6, 1970 (P.L. 91&ndash;304).</p>
