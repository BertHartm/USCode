<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Stoppage of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any State plan for aid and services to needy families with children which has been approved by the Secretary, if the Sec<!-- PDFPage:1210 -->retary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency administering or supervising the administration of such plan, finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the plan has been so changed as to impose any residence requirement prohibited by section 602(b) of this title, or that in the administration of the plan any such prohibited requirement is imposed, with the knowledge of such State agency, in a substantial number of cases; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantially with any provision required by section 602(a) of this title to be included in the plan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall notify such State agency that further payments will not be made to the State (or, in his discretion, that payments will be limited to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure) until the Secretary is satisfied that such prohibited requirement is no longer so imposed, and that there is no longer any such failure to comply. Until he is so satisfied he shall make no further payments to such State (or shall limit payments to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with State statute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment to which a State is otherwise entitled under this part for any period before September 1, 1962, shall be withheld by reason of any action taken pursuant to a State statute which requires that aid be denied under the State plan approved under this part with respect to a child because of the conditions in the home in which the child resides; nor shall any such payment be withheld for any period beginning on or after such date by reason of any action taken pursuant to such a statute if provision is otherwise made pursuant to a State statute for adequate care and assistance with respect to such child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Good faith effort to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State shall be found, prior to January 1, 1977, to have failed substantially to comply with the requirements of section 602(a)(27) of this title if, in the judgment of the Secretary, such State is making a good faith effort to implement the program required by such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction in amount payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After December 31, 1976, in the case of any State which is found to have failed substantially to comply with the requirements of section 602(a)(27) of this title, the reduction in any amount payable to such State required to be imposed under section 603(h) of this title shall be imposed in lieu of any reduction, with respect to such failure, which would otherwise be required to be imposed under this section.</p>
