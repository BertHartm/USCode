<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may assign members of the Corps to provide, under regulations promulgated by the Secretary, health services in or to a health professional shortage area during the assignment period only if&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An application for assignment of a Corps member to a health professional shortage area shall include a demonstration by the applicant that the area or population group to be served by the applicant has a shortage of personal health services and that the Corps member will be located so that the member will provide services to the greatest number of persons residing in such area or included in such population group. Such a demonstration shall be made on the basis of the criteria prescribed by the Secretary under section 254e(b) of this title and on additional criteria which the Secretary shall prescribe to determine if the area or population group to be served by the applicant has a shortage of personal health services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Corps members may be assigned to a Federal health care facility, but only upon the request of the head of the department or agency of which such facility is a part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may not approve an application for the assignment of a member of the Corps described in subparagraph (C) of section 254d(a)(1) of this title to an entity unless the application of the entity contains assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that the entity (A) has sufficient financial resources to provide the member of the Corps with an income of not less than the income to which the member would be entitled if the member was a member described in subparagraph (B) of section 254d(a)(1) of this title, or (B) would have such financial resources if a grant was made to the entity under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If in approving an application of an entity for the assignment of a member of the Corps described in subparagraph (C) of section 254d(a)(1) of this title the Secretary determines that the entity does not have sufficient financial resources to provide the member of the Corps with an income of not less than the income to which the member would be entitled if the member was a member described in subparagraph (B) of section 254d(a)(1) of this title, the Secretary may make a grant to the entity to assure that the member of the Corps assigned to it will receive during the period of assignment to the entity such an income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount of any grant under subparagraph (A) shall be determined by the Secretary. Payments under such a grant may be made in advance or by way of reimbursement, and at such intervals and on such conditions, as the Secretary finds necessary. No grant may be made unless an application therefor is submitted to and approved by the Secretary. Such an application shall be in such form, submitted in such manner, and contain such information, as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may provide, to public and private entities which are located in a health professional shortage area to which area a Corps member has been assigned, technical assistance to assist in the retention of such member in such area after the completion of such member's assignment to the area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may provide, to health professional shortage areas to which no Corps member has been assigned, (A) technical assistance to assist in the recruitment of health manpower for such areas, and (B) current information on public and private programs which provide assistance in the securing of health manpower.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to analyze the potential use of health professions personnel in defined health services delivery areas by the residents of such areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to determine the need for such personnel in such areas and to recruit, select, and retain health professions personnel (including members of the National Health Service Corps) to meet such need;</p>
