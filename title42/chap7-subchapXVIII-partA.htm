<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of post-hospital extended care services, such services are or were required to be given because the individual needs or needed on a daily basis skilled nursing care (provided directly by or requiring the supervision of skilled nursing personnel) or other skilled rehabilitation services, which as a practical matter can only be provided in a skilled nursing facility on an inpatient basis, for any of the conditions with respect to which he was receiving inpatient hospital services (or services which would constitute inpatient hospital services if the institution met the requirements of paragraphs (6) and (9) of section 1395x(e) of this title) prior to transfer to the skilled nursing facility or for a condition requiring such extended care services which arose after such transfer and while he was still in the facility for treatment of the condition or conditions for which he was receiving such inpatient hospital services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of home health services, such services are or were required because the individual is or was confined to his home (except when receiving items and services referred to in section 1395x(m)(7) of this title) and needs or needed skilled nursing care (other than solely venipuncture for the purpose of obtaining a blood sample) on an intermittent basis or physical or speech therapy or, in the case of an individual who has been furnished home health services based on such a need and who no longer has such a need for such care or therapy, continues or continued to need occupational therapy; a plan for furnishing such services to such individual has been established and is periodically reviewed by a physician; and such services are or were furnished while the individual was under the care of a physician; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) with respect to inpatient hospital services (other than inpatient psychiatric hospital services) which are furnished over a period of time, a physician certifies that such services are required to be given on an inpatient basis for such individual's medical treatment, or that inpatient diagnostic study is medically required and such services are necessary for such purpose, except that (A) such certification shall be furnished only in such cases, with such frequency, and accompanied by such supporting material, appropriate to the cases <!-- PDFPage:2053 -->involved, as may be provided by regulations, and (B) the first such certification required in accordance with clause (A) shall be furnished no later than the 20th day of such period;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) with respect to inpatient hospital services furnished such individual after the 20th day of a continuous period of such services, there was not in effect, at the time of admission of such individual to the hospital, a decision under section 1395cc(d) of this title (based on a finding that utilization review of long-stay cases is not being made in such hospital);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) with respect to inpatient hospital services or post-hospital extended care services furnished such individual during a continuous period, a finding has not been made (by the physician members of the committee or group, as described in section 1395x(k)(4) of this title, including any finding made in the course of a sample or other review of admissions to the institution) pursuant to the system of utilization review that further inpatient hospital services or further post-hospital extended care services, as the case may be, are not medically necessary; except that, if such a finding has been made, payment may be made for such services furnished before the 4th day after the day on which the hospital or skilled nursing facility, as the case may be, received notice of such finding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in the case of hospice care provided an individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) in the first 90-day period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the individual's attending physician (as defined in section 1395x(dd)(3)(B) of this title) (which for purposes of this subparagraph does not include a nurse practitioner), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the medical director (or physician member of the interdisciplinary group described in section 1395x(dd)(2)(B) of this title) of the hospice program providing (or arranging for) the care,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in a subsequent 90- or 60-day period, the medical director or physician described in clause (i)(II) recertifies at the beginning of the period that the individual is terminally ill based on such clinical judgment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a written plan for providing hospice care with respect to such individual has been established (before such care is provided by, or under arrangements made by, that hospice program) and is periodically reviewed by the individual's attending physician and by the medical director (and the interdisciplinary group described in section 1395x(dd)(2)(B) of this title) of the hospice program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such care is being or was provided pursuant to such plan of care; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in the case of inpatient critical access hospital services, a physician certifies that the individual may reasonably be expected to be discharged or transferred to a hospital within 96 hours after admission to the critical access hospital.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent provided by regulations, the certification and recertification requirements of paragraph (2) shall be deemed satisfied where, at a later date, a physician, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist (as the case may be) makes certification of the kind provided in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (2) (whichever would have applied), but only where such certification is accompanied by such medical and other evidence as may be required by such regulations. With respect to the physician certification required by paragraph (2) for home health services furnished to any individual by a home health agency (other than an agency which is a governmental entity) and with respect to the establishment and review of a plan for such services, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which shall become effective no later than July 1, 1981, and which prohibit a physician who has a significant ownership interest in, or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, such home health agency from performing such certification and from establishing or reviewing such plan, except that such prohibition shall not apply with respect to a home health agency which is a sole community home health agency (as determined by the Secretary). For purposes of the preceding sentence, service by a physician as an uncompensated officer or director of a home health agency shall not constitute having a significant ownership interest in, or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, such agency. For purposes of paragraph (2)(C), an individual shall be considered to be &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo; if the individual has a condition, due to an illness or injury, that restricts the ability of the individual to leave his or her home except with the assistance of another individual or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker), or if the individual has a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated. While an individual does not have to be bedridden to be considered &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo;, the condition of the individual should be such that there exists a normal inability to leave home and that leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort by the individual. Any absence of an individual from the home attributable to the need to receive health care treatment, including regular absences for the purpose of participating in therapeutic, psychosocial, or medical treatment in an adult day-care program that is licensed or certified by a State, or accredited, to furnish adult day-care services in the State shall not disqualify an individual from being considered to be &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo;. Any other absence of an individual from the home shall not so disqualify an individual if the absence is of infrequent or of relatively short duration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any absence for <!-- PDFPage:2054 -->the purpose of attending a religious service shall be deemed to be an absence of infrequent or short duration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount paid to provider of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount paid to any provider of services (other than a hospice program providing hospice care, other than a critical access hospital providing inpatient critical access hospital services, and other than a home health agency with respect to durable medical equipment) with respect to services for which payment may be made under this part shall, subject to the provisions of sections 1395e, 1395ww, and 1395fff of this title, be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in paragraph (3), the lesser of (A) the reasonable cost of such services, as determined under section 1395x(v) of this title and as further limited by section 1395rr(b)(2)(B) of this title, or (B) the customary charges with respect to such services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such services are furnished by a public provider of services, or by another provider which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a significant portion of its patients are low-income (and requests that payment be made under this paragraph), free of charge or at nominal charges to the public, the amount determined on the basis of those items (specified in regulations prescribed by the Secretary) included in the determination of such reasonable cost which the Secretary finds will provide fair compensation to such provider for such services; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if some or all of the hospitals in a State have been reimbursed for services (for which payment may be made under this part) pursuant to a reimbursement system approved as a demonstration project under section 402 of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 or section 222 of the Social Security Amendments of 1972, if the rate of increase in such hospitals in their costs per hospital inpatient admission of individuals entitled to benefits under this part over the duration of such project was equal to or less than such rate of increase for admissions of such individuals with respect to all hospitals in the United States during such period, and if either the State has legislative authority to operate such system and the State elects to have reimbursement to such hospitals made in accordance with this paragraph or the system is operated through a voluntary agreement of hospitals and such hospitals elect to have reimbursement to those hospitals made in accordance with this paragraph, then the Secretary may provide for continuation of reimbursement to such hospitals under such system until the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a third-party payor reimburses such a hospital on a basis other than under such system, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the aggregate rate of increase from January 1, 1981, to the most recent date for which annual data are available in such hospitals in costs per hospital inpatient admission of individuals entitled to benefits under this part is greater than such rate of increase for admissions of such individuals with respect to all hospitals in the United States for such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of any State which has had such a demonstration project reimbursement system in continuous operation since July 1, 1977, the Secretary shall provide under paragraph (3) for continuation of reimbursement to hospitals in the State under such system until the first day of the 37th month beginning after the date the Secretary determines and notifies the Governor of the State that either of the conditions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of such paragraph has occurred. If, by the end of such 36-month period, the Secretary determines, based on evidence submitted by the Governor of the State, that neither of the conditions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (3) continues to apply, the Secretary shall continue without interruption payment to hospitals in the State under the State's system. If, by the end of such 36-month period, the Secretary determines, based on such evidence, that either of the conditions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of such paragraph continues to apply, the Secretary shall (i) collect any net excess reimbursement to hospitals in the State during such 36-month period (basing such net excess reimbursement on the net difference, if any, in the rate of increase in costs per hospital inpatient admission under the State system compared to the rate of increase in such costs with respect to all hospitals in the United States over the 36-month period, as measured by including the cumulative savings under the State system based on the difference in the rate of increase in costs per hospital inpatient admission under the State system as compared to the rate of increase in such costs with respect to all hospitals in the United States between January 1, 1981, and the date of the Secretary's initial notice), and (ii) provide a reasonable period, not to exceed 2 years, for transition from the State system to the national payment system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) No payments to Federal providers of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 1395qq of this title, no payment may be made under this part (except under subsection (d) or subsection (h) of this section) to any Federal provider of services, except a provider of services which the Secretary determines is providing services to the public generally as a community institution or agency; and no such payment may be made to any provider of services for any item or service which such provider is obligated by a law of, or a contract with, the United States to render at public expense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments for emergency hospital services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payments shall also be made to any hospital for inpatient hospital services furnished in a calendar year, by the hospital or under arrangements (as defined in section 1395x(w) of this title) with it, to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title even though such hospital does not have an agreement in effect under this subchapter if (A) such services were emergency services, (B) the Secretary would be required to make such payment if the hospital had such an agreement in effect and otherwise met the conditions of payment hereunder, and (C) such hospital has elected to claim payments for all such inpatient emergency services and for the emergency outpatient services referred to in section <!-- PDFPage:2055 -->1395n(b) of this title furnished during such year. Such payments shall be made only in the amounts provided under subsection (b) of this section and then only if such hospital agrees to comply, with respect to the emergency services provided, with the provisions of section 1395cc(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payment may be made on the basis of an itemized bill to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title for services described in paragraph (1) which are emergency services if (A) payment cannot be made under paragraph (1) solely because the hospital does not elect to claim such payment, and (B) such individual files application (submitted within such time and in such form and manner and by such person, and containing and supported by such information as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) for reimbursement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amounts payable under the preceding paragraph with respect to services described therein shall, subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, be equal to 60 percent of the hospital's reasonable charges for routine services furnished in the accommodations occupied by the individual or in semiprivate accommodations (as defined in section 1395x(v)(4) of this title), whichever is less, plus 80 percent of the hospital's reasonable charges for ancillary services. If separate charges for routine and ancillary services are not made by the hospital, reimbursement may be based on two-thirds of the hospital's reasonable charges for the services received but not to exceed the charges which would have been made if the patient had occupied semiprivate accommodations. For purposes of the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;routine services&rdquo; shall mean the regular room, dietary, and nursing services, minor medical and surgical supplies and the use of equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not customarily made; the term &ldquo;ancillary services&rdquo; shall mean those special services for which charges are customarily made in addition to routine services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment for inpatient hospital services prior to notification of noneligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding that an individual is not entitled to have payment made under this part for inpatient hospital services furnished by any hospital, payment shall be made to such hospital (unless it elects not to receive such payment or, if payment has already been made by or on behalf of such individual, fails to refund such payment within the time specified by the Secretary) for such services which are furnished to the individual prior to notification to such hospital from the Secretary of his lack of entitlement, if such payments are precluded only by reason of section 1395d of this title and if such hospital complies with the requirements of and regulations under this subchapter with respect to such payments, has acted in good faith and without knowledge of such lack of entitlement, and has acted reasonably in assuming entitlement existed. Payment under the preceding sentence may not be made for services furnished an individual pursuant to any admission after the 6th elapsed day (not including as an elapsed day Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday) after the day on which such admission occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment for certain inpatient hospital services furnished outside United States</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall periodically determine the amount which should be paid under this part to each provider of services with respect to the services furnished by it, and the provider of services shall be paid, at such time or times as the Secretary believes appropriate (but not less often than monthly) and prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the amounts so determined, with necessary adjustments on account of previously made overpayments or underpayments; except that no such payments shall be made to any provider unless it has furnished such information as the Secretary may request in order to determine the amounts due such provider under this part for the period with respect to which the amounts are being paid or any prior period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment shall be made to a provider of services which is a hospital for or with respect to services furnished by it for any period with respect to which it is deemed, under section 1395x(w)(2) of this title, to have in effect an arrangement with a quality control and peer review organization for the conduct of utilization review activities by such organization unless such hospital has paid to such organization the amount due (as determined pursuant to such section) to such organization for the review activities conducted by it pursuant to such arrangements or such hospital has provided assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that such organization will promptly be paid the amount so due to it from the proceeds of the payment claimed by the hospital. Payment under this subchapter for utilization review activities provided by a quality control and peer review organization pursuant to an arrangement or deemed arrangement with a hospital under section 1395x(w)(2) of this title shall be calculated without any requirement that the reasonable cost of such activities be apportioned among the patients of such hospital, if any, to whom such activities were not applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payments under assignment or power of attorney</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment which may be made to a provider of services under this subchapter for any service furnished to an individual shall be made to any other person under an assignment or power of attorney; but nothing in this subsection shall be construed (1) to prevent the making of such a payment in accordance with an assignment from the provider if such assignment is made to a governmental agency or entity or is established by or pursuant to the order of a court of com<!-- PDFPage:2066 -->petent jurisdiction, or (2) to preclude an agent of the provider of services from receiving any such payment if (but only if) such agent does so pursuant to an agency agreement under which the compensation to be paid to the agent for his services for or in connection with the billing or collection of payments due such provider under this subchapter is unrelated (directly or indirectly) to the amount of such payments or the billings therefor, and is not dependent upon the actual collection of any such payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Accrual of interest on balance of excess or deficit not paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a final determination is made that the amount of payment made under this part to a provider of services was in excess of or less than the amount of payment that is due, and payment of such excess or deficit is not made (or effected by offset) within 30 days of the date of the determination, interest shall accrue on the balance of such excess or deficit not paid or offset (to the extent that the balance is owed by or owing to the provider) at a rate determined in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury applicable to charges for late payments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but only if the hospital was being paid for inpatient hospital services on such a periodic interim payment basis as of June 30, 1987, and continues to meet the requirements (in effect as of October 1, 1986) applicable to payment on such a basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In the case of a hospital that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is located in a rural area,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall provide (or continue to provide) for payment on a periodic interim payment basis (under the standards established under section 405.454(j) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on October 1, 1986, in the cases described in subparagraphs (A) through (D)) with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) inpatient hospital services of a hospital that is not a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(1)(B) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a hospital which is receiving payment under a State hospital reimbursement system under section 1395f(b)(3) or 1395ww(c) of this title, if payment on a periodic interim payment basis is an integral part of such reimbursement system;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) inpatient critical access hospital services;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if the provider of such services elects to receive, and qualifies for, such payments.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Skilled nursing facility&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this subchapter, the term &ldquo;skilled nursing facility&rdquo; means an institution (or a distinct part of an institution) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is primarily engaged in providing to residents&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) skilled nursing care and related services for residents who require medical or nursing care, or</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Quality assessment and assurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A skilled nursing facility must maintain a quality assessment and assurance committee, consisting of the director of nursing services, a physician designated by the facility, and at least 3 other members of the facility's staff, which (i) meets at least quarterly to identify issues with respect to which quality assessment and assurance activities are necessary and (ii) develops and implements appropriate plans of action to correct identified quality deficiencies. A State or the Secretary may not require disclosure of the records of such committee except insofar as such disclosure is related to the compliance of such committee with the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of services and activities under plan of care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A skilled nursing facility must provide services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident, in accordance with a written plan of care which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) describes the medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of the resident and how such needs will be met;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is initially prepared, with the participation to the extent practicable of the resident or the resident's family or legal representative, by a team which includes the resident's attending physician and a registered professional nurse with responsibility for the resident; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is periodically reviewed and revised by such team after each assessment under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Residents&rsquo; assessment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A skilled nursing facility must conduct a comprehensive, accurate, standardized, re<!-- PDFPage:2088 -->producible assessment of each resident's functional capacity, which assessment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) describes the resident's capability to perform daily life functions and significant impairments in functional capacity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is based on a uniform minimum data set specified by the Secretary under subsection (f)(6)(A) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) uses an instrument which is specified by the State under subsection (e)(5) of this section; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each such assessment must be conducted or coordinated (with the appropriate participation of health professionals) by a registered professional nurse who signs and certifies the completion of the assessment. Each individual who completes a portion of such an assessment shall sign and certify as to the accuracy of that portion of the assessment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Penalty for falsification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) An individual who willfully and knowingly certifies under clause (i) a material and false statement in a resident assessment is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $1,000 with respect to each assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) An individual who willfully and knowingly causes another individual to certify under clause (i) a material and false statement in a resident assessment is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $5,000 with respect to each assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this clause in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Use of independent assessors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a State determines, under a survey under subsection (g) of this section or otherwise, that there has been a knowing and willful certification of false assessments under this paragraph, the State may require (for a period specified by the State) that resident assessments under this paragraph be conducted and certified by individuals who are independent of the facility and who are approved by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Frequency</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to the timeframes prescribed by the Secretary under section 1395yy(e)(6) of this title, such an assessment must be conducted&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) in no case less often than once every 12 months.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Resident review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The skilled nursing facility must examine each resident no less frequently than once every 3 months and, as appropriate, revise the resident's assessment to assure the continuing accuracy of the assessment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The results of such an assessment shall be used in developing, reviewing, and revising the resident's plan of care under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Coordination</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Provision of services and activities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent needed to fulfill all plans of care described in paragraph (2), a skilled nursing facility must provide, directly or under arrangements (or, with respect to dental services, under agreements) with others for the provision of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) dietary services that assure that the meals meet the daily nutritional and special dietary needs of each resident;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) an on-going program, directed by a qualified professional, of activities designed to meet the interests and the physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a skilled nursing facility's deficiencies. If the Secretary finds, or pursuant to the recommendation of the State under paragraph (1) finds, that a skilled nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (B)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Specified remedies</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may impose a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of noncompliance. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Appointment of temporary management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In consultation with the State, the Secretary may appoint temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility's residents, where there is a need for temporary management while&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the Secretary may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the facility with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the facility,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the facility agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this subparagraph if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Repeated noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a skilled nursing facility which, on 3 consecutive standard surveys conducted under subsection (g)(2) of this section, has been found to have provided substandard quality of care, the Secretary shall (regardless of what other remedies are provided)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) impose the remedy described in subparagraph (B)(i), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) monitor the facility under subsection (g)(4)(B) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">until the facility has demonstrated, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that it is in compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, and that it will remain in compliance with such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective period of denial of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A finding to deny payment under this subsection shall terminate when the Secretary finds that the facility is in substantial compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Immediate termination of participation for facility where Secretary finds noncompliance and immediate jeopardy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that a skilled nursing facility has not met a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(B)(iii), or the Secretary shall terminate the facility's participation under this subchapter. If the facility's participation under this subchapter is terminated, the State shall provide for the safe and orderly transfer of the residents eligible under this subchapter consistent with the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The remedies provided under this subsection are in addition to those otherwise available under State or Federal law and shall not be construed as limiting such other remedies, including any remedy available to an individual at common law. The remedies described in clauses (i),<sup><a href="#1395i-3_5_target" name="1395i-3_5">5</a></sup> and (iii) of paragraph (2)(B) may be imposed during the pendency of any hearing.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Sharing of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, all information concerning skilled nursing facilities required by this section to be filed with the Secretary or a State agency shall be made available by such facilities to Federal or State employees for purposes consistent with the effective administration of programs established under this subchapter and subchapter XIX of this chapter, including investigations by State medicaid fraud control units.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where requirements or obligations under this section are identical to those provided under section 1396r of this title, the fulfillment of those requirements or obligations under section 1396r of this title shall be considered to be the fulfillment of the corresponding requirements or obligations under this section.</p>
