<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by multiplying the wage-related portion by the factor applied under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title (but without application of section 4410 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (42 U.S.C. 1395ww note)) during the preceding fiscal year for the teaching health center's area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) evaluate indirect training costs relative to supporting a primary care residency program in qualified teaching health centers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) based on this evaluation, assure that the aggregate of the payments for indirect expenses under this section and the payments for direct graduate medical education as determined under subsection (c) in a fiscal year do not exceed the amount appropriated for such expenses as determined in subsection (g).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Interim payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before the Secretary makes a payment under this subsection pursuant to a determination of indirect expenses under paragraph (1), the Secretary may provide to qualified teaching health centers a payment, in addition to any payment made under subsection (c), for expected indirect expenses associated with the additional costs of teaching residents for a fiscal year, based on an estimate by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Clarification regarding relationship to other payments for graduate medical education</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reconciliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall determine any changes to the number of residents reported by a hospital in the application of the hospital for the current fiscal year to determine the final amount pay<!-- PDFPage:353 -->able to the hospital for the current fiscal year for both direct expense and indirect expense amounts. Based on such determination, the Secretary shall recoup any overpayments made to pay any balance due to the extent possible. The final amount so determined shall be considered a final intermediary determination for the purposes of section 1395<em>oo</em> of this title and shall be subject to administrative and judicial review under that section in the same manner as the amount of payment under section 1395ww(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#256h_2_target" name="256h_2">2</a></sup> of this title is subject to review under such section.</p>
