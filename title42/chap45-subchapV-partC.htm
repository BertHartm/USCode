<p class="statutory-body">In selecting programs for review, the Director of the National Institute of Justice should consider&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Director of the National Institute of Justice shall annually report to the President, the Attorney General, and the Congress on the nature and findings of the evaluation and research and development activities funded under this section.</p>
