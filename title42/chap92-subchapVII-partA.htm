<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notices of rules and orders imposing prohibitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before the Secretary prescribes any rule or issues any order imposing a prohibition under this chapter, he shall publish such proposed rule or <!-- PDFPage:4796 -->order in the Federal Register, together with a statement of the reasons for such rule or order and, in the case of a rule, a detailed statement of any special circumstances or characteristics required to be taken into account in prescribing such rule.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petitions for exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any petition for an exemption from any prohibition under this chapter shall be filed at such time and shall be in such form as the Secretary shall by rule prescribe.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary, within 6 months after the period for public comment and hearing applicable to any petition for an exemption, shall issue a final order granting or denying the petition for such exemption, except that the Secretary may extend such period to a specified date if he publishes notice thereof in the Federal Register and includes with such notice a statement of the reasons for such extension.</p>
