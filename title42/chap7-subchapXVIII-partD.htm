<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, such term includes any institution which meets the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection. For purposes of sections 1395f(d) and 1395n(b) of this title (including determination of whether an individual received inpatient hospital services or diagnostic services for purposes of such sections), section 1395f(f)(2) of this title, and subsection (i) of this section, such term includes any institution which (i) meets the requirements of paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection, (ii) is not primarily engaged in providing the services described in subsection (j)(1)(A) of this section and (iii) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of individuals referred to in paragraph (1) of subsection (r) of this section, to inpatients diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons. For purposes of section 1395f(f)(1) of this title, such term includes an institution which (i) is a hospital for purposes of sections 1395f(d), 1395f(f)(2), and 1395n(b) of this title and (ii) is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, or is accredited by or approved by a program of the country in which such institution is located if the Secretary finds the accreditation or comparable approval standards of such program to be essentially equivalent to those of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, such term shall not, except for purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, include any institution which is primarily for the care and treatment of mental diseases unless it is a psychiatric hospital (as defined in subsection (f) of this section). The term &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; also includes a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in subsection (ss)(1) of this section), but only with respect to items and services ordinarily furnished by such institution to inpatients, and payment may be made with respect to services provided by or in such an institution only to such extent and under such conditions, limitations, and requirements (in addition to or in lieu of the conditions, limitations, and requirements otherwise applicable) as may be provided in regulations consistent with section 1395i&ndash;5 of this title. For provisions deeming certain requirements of this subsection to be met in the case of accredited institutions, see section 1395bb of this title. The term &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; also includes a facility of fifty beds or less which is located in an area determined by the Secretary to meet the definition relating to a rural area described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (5) of this subsection and which meets the other requirements of this subsection, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) with respect to the requirements for nursing services applicable after December 31, 1978, such requirements shall provide for temporary waiver of the requirements, for such period as the Secretary deems appropriate, where (i) the facility's failure to fully comply with the requirements is attributable to a temporary shortage of qualified nursing personnel in the area in which the facility is located, (ii) a registered professional nurse is present on the premises to render or supervise the nursing service provided during at least the regular daytime shift, and (iii) the Secretary determines that the employment of such nursing personnel as are available to the facility during such temporary period will not adversely affect the health and safety of patients;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the health and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), such requirements shall be applied by the Secretary to a facility herein defined in such manner as to assure that personnel requirements take into account the availability of technical personnel and the educational opportunities for technical personnel in the area in which such facility is located, and the scope of services rendered by such facility; and the Secretary, by regulations, shall provide for the continued participation of such a facility where such personnel requirements are not fully met, for such period as the Secretary determines that (i) the facility is making good faith efforts to fully comply with the personnel requirements, (ii) the employment by the facility of such personnel as are available to <!-- PDFPage:2150 -->the facility will not adversely affect the health and safety of patients, and (iii) if the Secretary has determined that because of the facility's waiver under this subparagraph the facility should limit its scope of services in order not to adversely affect the health and safety of the facility's patients, the facility is so limiting the scope of services it provides; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) with respect to the fire and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), the Secretary (i) may waive, for such period as he deems appropriate, specific provisions of such requirements which if rigidly applied would result in unreasonable hardship for such a facility and which, if not applied, would not jeopardize the health and safety of patients, and (ii) may accept a facility's compliance with all applicable State codes relating to fire and safety in lieu of compliance with the fire and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), if he determines that such State has in effect fire and safety codes, imposed by State law, which adequately protect patients.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The term &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; does not include, unless the context otherwise requires, a critical access hospital (as defined in subsection (mm)(1) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Psychiatric hospital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;psychiatric hospital&rdquo; means an institution which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of a physician, psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (3) through (9) of subsection (e) of this section;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of an institution which satisfies paragraphs (1) and (2) of the preceding sentence and which contains a distinct part which also satisfies paragraphs (3) and (4) of such sentence, such distinct part shall be considered to be a &ldquo;psychiatric hospital&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Outpatient occupational therapy services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;outpatient occupational therapy services&rdquo; has the meaning given the term &ldquo;outpatient physical therapy services&rdquo; in subsection (p) of this section, except that &ldquo;occupational&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;physical&rdquo; each place it appears therein.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;post-hospital extended care services&rdquo; means extended care services furnished an individual after transfer from a hospital in which he was an inpatient for not less than 3 consecutive days before his discharge from the hospital in connection with such transfer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, items and services shall be deemed to have been furnished to an individual after transfer from a hospital, and he shall be deemed to have been an inpatient in the hospital immediately before transfer therefrom, if he is admitted to the skilled nursing facility (A) within 30 days after discharge from such hospital, or (B) within such time as it would be medically appropriate to begin an active course of treatment, in the case of an individual whose condition is such that skilled nursing facility care would not be medically appropriate within 30 days after discharge from a hospital; and an individual shall be deemed not to have been discharged from a skilled nursing facility if, within 30 days after discharge therefrom, he is admitted to such facility or any other skilled nursing facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Skilled nursing facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;skilled nursing facility&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 1395i&ndash;3(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Utilization review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A utilization review plan of a hospital or skilled nursing facility shall be considered sufficient if it is applicable to services furnished by the institution to individuals entitled to insurance benefits under this subchapter and if it provides&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for the review, on a sample or other basis, of admissions to the institution, the duration <!-- PDFPage:2151 -->of stays therein, and the professional services (including drugs and biologicals) furnished, (A) with respect to the medical necessity of the services, and (B) for the purpose of promoting the most efficient use of available health facilities and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for such review to be made by either (A) a staff committee of the institution composed of two or more physicians (of which at least two must be physicians described in subsection (r)(1) of this section), with or without participation of other professional personnel, or (B) a group outside the institution which is similarly composed and (i) which is established by the local medical society and some or all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the locality, or (ii) if (and for as long as) there has not been established such a group which serves such institution, which is established in such other manner as may be approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for such review, in each case of inpatient hospital services or extended care services furnished to such an individual during a continuous period of extended duration, as of such days of such period (which may differ for different classes of cases) as may be specified in regulations, with such review to be made as promptly as possible, after each day so specified, and in no event later than one week following such day; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for prompt notification to the institution, the individual, and his attending physician of any finding (made after opportunity for consultation to such attending physician) by the physician members of such committee or group that any further stay in the institution is not medically necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The review committee must be composed as provided in clause (B) of paragraph (2) rather than as provided in clause (A) of such paragraph in the case of any hospital or skilled nursing facility where, because of the small size of the institution, or (in the case of a skilled nursing facility) because of lack of an organized medical staff, or for such other reason or reasons as may be included in regulations, it is impracticable for the institution to have a properly functioning staff committee for the purposes of this subsection. If the Secretary determines that the utilization review procedures established pursuant to subchapter XIX of this chapter are superior in their effectiveness to the procedures required under this section, he may, to the extent that he deems it appropriate, require for purposes of this subchapter that the procedures established pursuant to subchapter XIX of this chapter be utilized instead of the procedures required by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Agreements for transfer between skilled nursing facilities and hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A hospital and a skilled nursing facility shall be considered to have a transfer agreement in effect if, by reason of a written agreement between them or (in case the two institutions are under common control) by reason of a written undertaking by the person or body which controls them, there is reasonable assurance that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) transfer of patients will be effected between the hospital and the skilled nursing facility whenever such transfer is medically appropriate as determined by the attending physician; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there will be interchange of medical and other information necessary or useful in the care and treatment of individuals transferred between the institutions, or in determining whether such individuals can be adequately cared for otherwise than in either of such institutions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any skilled nursing facility which does not have such an agreement in effect, but which is found by a State agency (of the State in which such facility is situated) with which an agreement under section 1395aa of this title is in effect (or, in the case of a State in which no such agency has an agreement under section 1395aa of this title, by the Secretary) to have attempted in good faith to enter into such an agreement with a hospital sufficiently close to the facility to make feasible the transfer between them of patients and the information referred to in paragraph (2), shall be considered to have such an agreement in effect if and for so long as such agency (or the Secretary, as the case may be) finds that to do so is in the public interest and essential to assuring extended care services for persons in the community who are eligible for payments with respect to such services under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Home health services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;home health services&rdquo; means the following items and services furnished to an individual, who is under the care of a physician, by a home health agency or by others under arrangements with them made by such agency, under a plan (for furnishing such items and services to such individual) established and periodically reviewed by a physician, which items and services are, except as provided in paragraph (7), provided on a visiting basis in a place of residence used as such individual's home&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) part-time or intermittent nursing care provided by or under the supervision of a registered professional nurse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) physical or occupational therapy or speech-language pathology services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) medical social services under the direction of a physician;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to the extent permitted in regulations, part-time or intermittent services of a home health aide who has successfully completed a training program approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) medical supplies (including catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags, and supplies related to ostomy care, and a covered osteoporosis drug (as defined in subsection (kk) of this section), but excluding other drugs and biologicals) and durable medical equipment while under such a plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in the case of a home health agency which is affiliated or under common control with a hospital, medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of such hospital, under a teaching program of such hospital approved as provided in the last sentence of subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) any of the foregoing items and services which are provided on an outpatient basis, under arrangements made by the home health <!-- PDFPage:2152 -->agency, at a hospital or skilled nursing facility, or at a rehabilitation center which meets such standards as may be prescribed in regulations, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the furnishing of which involves the use of equipment of such a nature that the items and services cannot readily be made available to the individual in such place of residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which are furnished at such facility while he is there to receive any such item or service described in clause (A),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but not including transportation of the individual in connection with any such item or service;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">excluding, however, any item or service if it would not be included under subsection (b) of this section if furnished to an inpatient of a hospital. For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (4), the term &ldquo;part-time or intermittent services&rdquo; means skilled nursing and home health aide services furnished any number of days per week as long as they are furnished (combined) less than 8 hours each day and 28 or fewer hours each week (or, subject to review on a case-by-case basis as to the need for care, less than 8 hours each day and 35 or fewer hours per week). For purposes of sections 1395f(a)(2)(C) and 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title, &ldquo;intermittent&rdquo; means skilled nursing care that is either provided or needed on fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours of each day for periods of 21 days or less (with extensions in exceptional circumstances when the need for additional care is finite and predictable).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Durable medical equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;durable medical equipment&rdquo; includes iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and wheelchairs (which may include a power-operated vehicle that may be appropriately used as a wheelchair, but only where the use of such a vehicle is determined to be necessary on the basis of the individual's medical and physical condition and the vehicle meets such safety requirements as the Secretary may prescribe) used in the patient's home (including an institution used as his home other than an institution that meets the requirements of subsection (e)(1) of this section or section 1395i&ndash;3(a)(1) of this title), whether furnished on a rental basis or purchased, and includes blood-testing strips and blood glucose monitors for individuals with diabetes without regard to whether the individual has Type I or Type II diabetes or to the individual's use of insulin (as determined under standards established by the Secretary in consultation with the appropriate organizations); except that such term does not include such equipment furnished by a supplier who has used, for the demonstration and use of specific equipment, an individual who has not met such minimum training standards as the Secretary may establish with respect to the demonstration and use of such specific equipment. With respect to a seat-lift chair, such term includes only the seat-lift mechanism and does not include the chair.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Home health agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;home health agency&rdquo; means a public agency or private organization, or a subdivision of such an agency or organization, which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has policies, established by a group of professional personnel (associated with the agency or organization), including one or more physicians and one or more registered professional nurses, to govern the services (referred to in paragraph (1)) which it provides, and provides for supervision of such services by a physician or registered professional nurse;</p>

In prescribing the regulations referred to in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the principles generally applied by national organizations or established prepayment organizations (which have developed such principles) in computing the amount of payment, to be made by persons other than the recipients of services, to providers of services on account of services furnished to such recipients by such providers. Such regulations may provide for determination of the costs of services on a per diem, per unit, per capita, or other basis, may provide for using different methods in different circumstances, may provide for the use of estimates of costs of particular items or services, may provide for the establishment of limits on the direct or indirect overall incurred costs or incurred costs of specific items or services or groups of items or services to be recognized as reasonable based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established under this subchapter, and may provide for the use of charges or a percentage of charges where this method reasonably reflects the costs. Such regulations shall (i) take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services (excluding therefrom any such costs, including standby costs, which are determined in accordance with regulations to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of services covered by the insurance programs established under this subchapter) in order that, under the methods of determining costs, the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this subchapter will not be borne by <!-- PDFPage:2157 -->individuals not so covered, and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs, and (ii) provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) Such regulations may, in the case of skilled nursing facilities in any State, provide for the use of rates, developed by the State in which such facilities are located, for the payment of the cost of skilled nursing facility services furnished under the State's plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter (and such rates may be increased by the Secretary on a class or size of institution or on a geographical basis by a percentage factor not in excess of 10 percent to take into account determinable items or services or other requirements under this subchapter not otherwise included in the computation of such State rates), if the Secretary finds that such rates are reasonably related to (but not necessarily limited to) analyses undertaken by such State of costs of care in comparable facilities in such State. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, such regulations with respect to skilled nursing facilities shall take into account (in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A) and based on patient-days of services furnished) the costs (including the costs of services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident eligible for benefits under this subchapter) of such facilities complying with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 1395i&ndash;3 of this title (including the costs of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs and competency evaluation programs).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In any case in which a hospital provides inpatient services to an individual that would constitute post-hospital extended care services if provided by a skilled nursing facility and a quality control and peer review organization (or, in the absence of such a qualified organization, the Secretary or such agent as the Secretary may designate) determines that inpatient hospital services for the individual are not medically necessary but post-hospital extended care services for the individual are medically necessary and such extended care services are not otherwise available to the individual (as determined in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary) at the time of such determination, payment for such services provided to the individual shall continue to be made under this subchapter at the payment rate described in clause (ii) during the period in which&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Use of State agencies to determine compliance by providers of services with conditions of participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make an agreement with any State which is able and willing to do so under which the services of the State health agency or other appropriate State agency (or the appropriate local agencies) will be utilized by him for the purpose of determining whether an institution therein is a hospital or skilled nursing facility, or whether an agency therein is a home health agency, or whether an agency is a hospice program or whether a facility therein is a rural health clinic as defined in section 1395x(aa)(2) of this title, a critical access hospital, as defined in section 1395x(mm)(1) of this title, or a comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility as defined in section 1395x(cc)(2) of this title, or whether a laboratory meets the requirements of paragraphs (16) and (17) of section 1395x(s) of this title, or whether a clinic, rehabilitation agency or public health agency meets the requirements of subparagraph (A) or (B), as the case may be, of section 1395x(p)(4) of this title, or whether an ambulatory surgical center meets the standards specified under section 1395k(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title. To the extent that the Secretary finds it appropriate, an institution or agency which such a State (or local) agency certifies is a hospital, skilled nursing facility, rural health clinic, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, home health agency, or hospice program (as those terms are defined in section 1395x of this title) may be treated as such by the Secretary. Any State agency which has such an agreement may (subject to approval of the Secretary) furnish to a skilled nursing facility, after proper request by such facility, such specialized consultative services (which such agency is able and willing to furnish in a manner satisfactory to the Secretary) as such facility may need to meet one or more of the conditions specified in section 1395i&ndash;3(a) of this title. Any such services furnished by a State agency shall be deemed to have been furnished pursuant to such agreement. Within 90 days following the completion of each survey of any health care facility, ambulatory surgical center, rural health clinic, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, laboratory, clinic, agency, or organization by the appropriate State or local agency described in the first sentence of this subsection, the Secretary shall make public in readily available form and place, and require (in the case of skilled nursing facilities) the posting in a place readily accessible to patients (and patients&rsquo; representatives), the pertinent findings of each such survey relating to the compliance of each such health care facility, ambulatory surgical center, rural health clinic, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, laboratory, clinic, agency, or organization with (1) the statutory conditions of participation imposed under this subchapter and (2) the major additional conditions which the Secretary finds necessary in the interest of health and safety of individuals who are furnished care or services by any such health care facility, ambulatory surgical center, rural health clinic, comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility, laboratory, clinic, agency, or organization. Any agreement under this subsection shall provide for the appropriate State or local agency to maintain a toll-free hotline (1) to collect, maintain, and continually update information on home health agencies located in the State or locality that are certified to participate in the program established under this subchapter (which information shall include any significant deficiencies found with respect to patient care in the most recent certification survey conducted by a State agency or accreditation survey conducted by a private accreditation agency under section 1395bb of this title with respect to the home health agency, when that survey was completed, whether corrective actions have been taken or are planned, and the sanctions, if any, imposed under this subchapter with respect to the agency) and (2) to receive complaints (and answer questions) with respect to home health agencies in the State or locality. Any such agreement shall provide for such State or local agency to maintain a unit for investigating such complaints that possesses enforcement authority and has access to survey and certification reports, information gathered by any private accreditation agency utilized by the Secretary under section 1395bb of this title, and consumer medical records (but only with the consent of the consumer or his or her legal representative).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment in advance or by way of reimbursement to State for performance of functions of subsection (a)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall pay any such State, in advance or by way of reimbursement, as may be provided in the agreement with it (and may make adjustments in such payments on account of overpayments or underpayments previously made), for the reasonable cost of performing the functions specified in subsection (a) of this section, and for the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund's fair share of the costs attributable to the planning and other efforts directed toward coordination of activities in carrying out its agreement and other activities related to the provision of services similar to those for which payment may be made under part A of this subchapter, or related to the facilities and personnel required for the provision of such services, or related to improving the quality of such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of State or local agencies to survey hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to enter into an agreement with any State under which the appropriate State or local agency which performs <!-- PDFPage:2217 -->the certification function described in subsection (a) of this section will survey, on a selective sample basis (or where the Secretary finds that a survey is appropriate because of substantial allegations of the existence of a significant deficiency or deficiencies which would, if found to be present, adversely affect health and safety of patients), provider entities that, pursuant to subsection (a) or (b)(1) of section 1395bb of this title, are treated as meeting the conditions or requirements of this subchapter. The Secretary shall pay for such services in the manner prescribed in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Fulfillment of requirements by States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not enter an agreement under this section with a State with respect to determining whether an institution therein is a skilled nursing facility unless the State meets the requirements specified in section 1395i&ndash;3(e) of this title and section 1395i&ndash;3(g) of this title and the establishment of remedies under sections 1395i&ndash;3(h)(2)(B) and 1395i&ndash;3(h)(2)(C) of this title (relating to establishment and application of remedies).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition of user fees for survey and certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may not impose, or require a State to impose, any fee on any facility or entity subject to a determination under subsection (a) of this section, or any renal dialysis facility subject to the requirements of section 1395rr(b)(1) of this title, for any such determination or any survey relating to determining the compliance of such facility or entity with any requirement of this subchapter (other than any fee relating to section 263a of this title).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395bb_1_target" name="1395bb_1">1</a></sup> of this section and the second sentence of section 1395z of this title, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an institution is accredited as a hospital by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) such institution authorizes the Commission to release to the Secretary upon his request (or such State agency as the Secretary may designate) a copy of the most current accreditation survey of such institution made by such Commission, together with any other information directly related to the survey as the Secretary may require (including corrective action plans),<sup><a href="#1395bb_2_target" name="1395bb_2">2</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such Commission releases such a copy and any such information to the Secretary,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:2220 --><p class="statutory-body-block">then, such institution shall be deemed to meet the requirements of the numbered paragraphs of section 1395x(e) of this title; except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) paragraph (6) thereof, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any standard, promulgated by the Secretary pursuant to paragraph (9) thereof, which is higher than the requirements prescribed for accreditation by such Commission.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If such Commission, as a condition for accreditation of a hospital, requires a utilization review plan (or imposes another requirement which serves substantially the same purpose), requires a discharge planning process (or imposes another requirement which serves substantially the same purpose), or imposes a standard which the Secretary determines is at least equivalent to the standard promulgated by the Secretary as described in paragraph (4) of this subsection, the Secretary is authorized to find that all institutions so accredited by such Commission comply also with clause (A) or (B) of section 1395x(e)(6) of this title or the standard described in such paragraph (4), as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Accreditation by American Osteopathic Association or other national accreditation body</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In addition, if the Secretary finds that accreditation of a provider entity (as defined in paragraph (4)) by the American Osteopathic Association or any other national accreditation body demonstrates that all of the applicable conditions or requirements of this subchapter (other than the requirements of section 1395m(j) of this title or the conditions and requirements under section 1395rr(b) of this title) are met or exceeded&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of a provider entity not described in paragraph (3)(B), the Secretary shall treat such entity as meeting those conditions or requirements with respect to which the Secretary made such finding; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of a provider entity described in paragraph (3)(B), the Secretary may treat such entity as meeting those conditions or requirements with respect to which the Secretary made such finding.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making such a finding, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors with respect to a national accreditation body, its requirements for accreditation, its survey procedures, its ability to provide adequate resources for conducting required surveys and supplying information for use in enforcement activities, its monitoring procedures for provider entities found out of compliance with the conditions or requirements, and its ability to provide the Secretary with necessary data for validation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), not later than 60 days after the date of receipt of a written request for a finding under paragraph (1) (with any documentation necessary to make a determination on the request), the Secretary shall publish a notice identifying the national accreditation body making the request, describing the nature of the request, and providing a period of at least 30 days for the public to comment on the request. The Secretary shall approve or deny a request for such a finding, and shall publish notice of such approval or denial, not later than 210 days after the date of receipt of the request (with such documentation). Such an approval shall be effective with respect to accreditation determinations made on or after such effective date (which may not be later than the date of publication of the approval) as the Secretary specifies in the publication notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The 210-day and 60-day deadlines specified in subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of any request for a finding with respect to accreditation of a provider entity to which the conditions and requirements of section&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395bb_3_target" name="1395bb_3">3</a></sup> 1395i&ndash;3 and 1395x(j) of this title apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;provider entity&rdquo; means a provider of services, supplier, facility, clinic, agency, or laboratory.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disclosure of accreditation survey</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not disclose any accreditation survey (other than a survey with respect to a home health agency) made and released to him by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, the American Osteopathic Association, or any other national accreditation body, of an entity accredited by such body, except that the Secretary may disclose such a survey and information related to such a survey to the extent such survey and information relate to an enforcement action taken by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deficiencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, if the Secretary finds that a provider entity has significant deficiencies (as defined in regulations pertaining to health and safety), the entity shall, after the date of notice of such finding to the entity and for such period as may be prescribed in regulations, be deemed not to meet the conditions or requirements the entity has been treated as meeting pursuant to subsection (a) or (b)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State or local accreditation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For provisions relating to validation surveys of entities that are treated as meeting applicable conditions or requirements of this subchapter pursuant to subsection (a) or (b)(1) of this section, see section 1395aa(c) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Medical screening requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a hospital that has a hospital emergency department, if any individual (whether or not eligible for benefits under this subchapter) comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1) of this section) exists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Necessary stabilizing treatment for emergency medical conditions and labor</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any individual (whether or not eligible for benefits under this subchapter) comes to a hospital and the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition, the hospital must provide either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) within the staff and facilities available at the hospital, for such further medical examination and such treatment as may be required to stabilize the medical condition, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for transfer of the individual to another medical facility in accordance with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Refusal to consent to treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A hospital is deemed to meet the requirement of paragraph (1)(A) with respect to an individual if the hospital offers the individual the further medical examination and treatment described in that paragraph and informs the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of such examination and treatment, but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) refuses to consent to the examination and treatment. The hospital shall take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's (or person's) written informed consent to refuse such examination and treatment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Refusal to consent to transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A hospital is deemed to meet the requirement of paragraph (1) with respect to an indi<!-- PDFPage:2240 -->vidual if the hospital offers to transfer the individual to another medical facility in accordance with subsection (c) of this section and informs the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) of the risks and benefits to the individual of such transfer, but the individual (or a person acting on the individual's behalf) refuses to consent to the transfer. The hospital shall take all reasonable steps to secure the individual's (or person's) written informed consent to refuse such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restricting transfers until individual stabilized</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual at a hospital has an emergency medical condition which has not been stabilized (within the meaning of subsection (e)(3)(B) of this section), the hospital may not transfer the individual unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) the individual (or a legally responsible person acting on the individual's behalf) after being informed of the hospital's obligations under this section and of the risk of transfer, in writing requests transfer to another medical facility,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a physician (within the meaning of section 1395x(r)(1) of this title) has signed a certification that&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395dd_1_target" name="1395dd_1">1</a></sup> based upon the information available at the time of transfer, the medical benefits reasonably expected from the provision of appropriate medical treatment at another medical facility outweigh the increased risks to the individual and, in the case of labor, to the unborn child from effecting the transfer, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if a physician is not physically present in the emergency department at the time an individual is transferred, a qualified medical person (as defined by the Secretary in regulations) has signed a certification described in clause (ii) after a physician (as defined in section 1395x(r)(1) of this title), in consultation with the person, has made the determination described in such clause, and subsequently countersigns the certification; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the transfer is an appropriate transfer (within the meaning of paragraph (2)) to that facility.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A certification described in clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) shall include a summary of the risks and benefits upon which the certification is based.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Appropriate transfer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An appropriate transfer to a medical facility is a transfer&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in which the transferring hospital provides the medical treatment within its capacity which minimizes the risks to the individual's health and, in the case of a woman in labor, the health of the unborn child;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in which the receiving facility&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) has available space and qualified personnel for the treatment of the individual, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) has agreed to accept transfer of the individual and to provide appropriate medical treatment;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in which the transferring hospital sends to the receiving facility all medical records (or copies thereof), related to the emergency condition for which the individual has presented, available at the time of the transfer, including records related to the individual's emergency medical condition, observations of signs or symptoms, preliminary diagnosis, treatment provided, results of any tests and the informed written consent or certification (or copy thereof) provided under paragraph (1)(A), and the name and address of any on-call physician (described in subsection (d)(1)(C) of this section) who has refused or failed to appear within a reasonable time to provide necessary stabilizing treatment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in which the transfer is effected through qualified personnel and transportation equipment, as required including the use of necessary and medically appropriate life support measures during the transfer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) which meets such other requirements as the Secretary may find necessary in the interest of the health and safety of individuals transferred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Civil money penalties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A participating hospital that negligently violates a requirement of this section is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $50,000 (or not more than $25,000 in the case of a hospital with less than 100 beds) for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this subparagraph in the same manner as such provisions apply with respect to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subject to subparagraph (C), any physician who is responsible for the examination, treatment, or transfer of an individual in a participating hospital, including a physician on-call for the care of such an individual, and who negligently violates a requirement of this section, including a physician who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) signs a certification under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section that the medical benefits reasonably to be expected from a transfer to another facility outweigh the risks associated with the transfer, if the physician knew or should have known that the benefits did not outweigh the risks, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) misrepresents an individual's condition or other information, including a hospital's obligations under this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $50,000 for each such violation and, if the violation is is&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395dd_2_target" name="1395dd_2">2</a></sup> gross and flagrant or is repeated, to exclusion from participation in this subchapter and State health care programs. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than the first and second sentences of subsection (a) and subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty and exclusion under <!-- PDFPage:2241 -->this subparagraph in the same manner as such provisions apply with respect to a penalty, exclusion, or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) If, after an initial examination, a physician determines that the individual requires the services of a physician listed by the hospital on its list of on-call physicians (required to be maintained under section 1395cc(a)(1)(I) of this title) and notifies the on-call physician and the on-call physician fails or refuses to appear within a reasonable period of time, and the physician orders the transfer of the individual because the physician determines that without the services of the on-call physician the benefits of transfer outweigh the risks of transfer, the physician authorizing the transfer shall not be subject to a penalty under subparagraph (B). However, the previous sentence shall not apply to the hospital or to the on-call physician who failed or refused to appear.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Civil enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Personal harm</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any individual who suffers personal harm as a direct result of a participating hospital's violation of a requirement of this section may, in a civil action against the participating hospital, obtain those damages available for personal injury under the law of the State in which the hospital is located, and such equitable relief as is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Financial loss to other medical facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any medical facility that suffers a financial loss as a direct result of a participating hospital's violation of a requirement of this section may, in a civil action against the participating hospital, obtain those damages available for financial loss, under the law of the State in which the hospital is located, and such equitable relief as is appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limitations on actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No action may be brought under this paragraph more than two years after the date of the violation with respect to which the action is brought.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consultation with peer review organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In considering allegations of violations of the requirements of this section in imposing sanctions under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall request the appropriate utilization and quality control peer review organization (with a contract under part B of subchapter XI of this chapter) to assess whether the individual involved had an emergency medical condition which had not been stabilized, and provide a report on its findings. Except in the case in which a delay would jeopardize the health or safety of individuals, the Secretary shall request such a review before effecting a sanction under paragraph (1) and shall provide a period of at least 60 days for such review.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payments to providers of services or other person regarded as payment to individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any payment under this subchapter to any provider of services or other person with respect to any items or services furnished any individual shall be regarded as a payment to such individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incorrect payments on behalf of individuals; payment adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) more than the correct amount is paid under this subchapter to a provider of services or other person for items or services furnished an individual and the Secretary determines (A) that, within such period as he may specify, the excess over the correct amount cannot be recouped from such provider of services or other person, or (B) that such provider of services or other person was without fault with respect to the payment of such excess over the correct amount, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any payment has been made under section 1395f(e) of this title to a provider of services or other person for items or services furnished an individual,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">proper adjustments shall be made, under regulations prescribed (after consultation with the Railroad Retirement Board) by the Secretary, by decreasing subsequent payments&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to which such individual is entitled under subchapter II of this chapter or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.], as the case may be, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if such individual dies before such adjustment has been completed, to which any other individual is entitled under subchapter II of this chapter or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.], as the case may be, with respect to the wages and self-employment income or the compensation constituting the basis of the benefits of such deceased individual under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">As soon as practicable after any adjustment under paragraph (3) or (4) is determined to be necessary, the Secretary, for purposes of this section, section 1395i(g) of this title, and section 1395t(f) of this title, shall certify (to the Railroad Retirement Board if the adjustment is to be made by decreasing subsequent payments under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.]) the amount of the overpayment as to which the adjustment is to be made. For purposes of clause (B) of paragraph (1), such provider of services or such other person shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be deemed to be without fault if the Secretary's determination that more than such correct amount was paid was made subsequent to the third year following the year in which notice was sent to such individual that such amount had been paid; except that the Secretary may reduce such three-year period to not less than one year if he finds such reduction is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception to subsection (b) payment adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be no adjustment as provided in subsection (b) of this section (nor shall there be recovery) in any case where the incorrect payment has been made (including payments under section 1395f(e) of this title) with respect to an individual who is without fault or where the adjustment (or recovery) would be made by decreasing payments to which another person who is without fault is entitled as provided in subsection (b)(4) of this section, if such adjustment (or recovery) would defeat the purposes of subchapter II or subchapter XVIII of this chapter or would be against equity and good conscience. Adjustment or recovery of an incorrect payment (or only such part of an incorrect payment as the Secretary determines to be inconsistent with the purposes of this subchapter) against an individual who is without fault shall be deemed to be against equity and good conscience if (A) the incorrect payment was made for expenses incurred for items or services for which payment may not be made under this subchapter by reason of the provisions of paragraph (1) or (9) of section 1395y(a) of this title and (B) if the Secretary's determination that such payment was incorrect was made subsequent to the third year following the year in which notice of such payment was sent to such individual; except that the Secretary may reduce such three-year period to not less than one year if he finds such reduction is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Liability of certifying or disbursing officer for failure to recoup</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No certifying or disbursing officer shall be held liable for any amount certified or paid by him to any provider of services or other person where the adjustment or recovery of such amount is waived under subsection (c) of this section or where adjustment under subsection (b) of this section is not completed prior to the death of all persons against whose benefits such adjustment is authorized.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the payment for such services was made (before or after such individual's death) by a person other than the deceased individual, to the person or persons determined by the Secretary under regulations to have paid for such services, or if the payment for such services was made by the deceased individual before his death, to the legal representative of the estate of such deceased individual, if any;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), to the person, if any, who is determined by the Secretary to be the surviving spouse of the deceased individual and who was either living in the same household with the deceased at the time of his death or was, for the month in which the deceased individual died, entitled to a monthly benefit on the basis of the same wages and self-employment income as was the deceased individual;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the person, if any, determined by the Secretary to be the surviving spouse of the deceased individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), or (5), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the person or persons, if any, determined by the Secretary to be the child or children of the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such child, in equal parts to each such child);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), or (6), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the parent or parents, if any, of the deceased individual (and, in case there is more than one such parent, in equal parts to each such parent); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) if there is no person who meets the requirements of paragraph (1), (2), (3), (4), (5), (6), or (7), or if each person who meets such requirements dies before the payment due him under this subchapter is completed, to the legal representatives of the estate of the deceased individual, if any.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Settlement of claims for section 1395k benefits on behalf of deceased individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an individual who received medical and other health services for which payment may be made under section 1395k(a)(1) of this title dies, and no assignment of the right to payment for such services was made by such individual before his death, and payment for such services has not been made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the person or persons who furnished the services agree to the terms of assignment specified in section 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title with respect to the services, payment for such services shall be made to such person or persons, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if the person or persons who furnished the services do not agree to the terms of assignment specified in section 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title with respect to the services, payment for such services shall be made on the basis of an itemized bill to the person who has agreed to assume the legal obligation to make payment for such services and files a request for payment (with such accompanying evidence of such legal obligation as may be required in regulations),</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall annually determine, and shall announce (in a manner intended to provide notice to interested parties) not later than September 7 before the calendar year concerned&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a per capita rate of payment for each class of individuals who are enrolled under this section with an eligible organization which has entered into a risk-sharing contract and who are entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter and enrolled under part B of this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a per capita rate of payment for each class of individuals who are so enrolled with such an organization and who are enrolled under part B of this subchapter only.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;risk-sharing contract&rdquo; means a contract entered into under subsection (g) of this section and the term &ldquo;reasonable cost reimbursement contract&rdquo; means a contract entered into under subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall define appropriate classes of members, based on age, disability status, and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, so as to ensure actuarial equivalence. The Secretary may add to, modify, or substitute for such classes, if such changes will improve the determination of actuarial equivalence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The annual per capita rate of payment for each such class shall be equal to 95 percent of the adjusted average per capita cost (as defined in paragraph (4)) for that class.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In the case of an eligible organization with a risk-sharing contract, the Secretary shall make monthly payments in advance and in accordance with the rate determined under subparagraph (C) and except as provided in subsection (g)(2) of this section, to the organization for each individual enrolled with the organization under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The amount of payment under this paragraph may be retroactively adjusted to take into account any difference between the actual number of individuals enrolled in the plan under this section and the number of such individuals estimated to be so enrolled in determining the amount of the advance payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), the Secretary may make retroactive adjustments under clause (i) to take into account individuals enrolled during the period beginning on the date on which the individual enrolls with an eligible organization (which has a risk-sharing contract under this section) under a health benefit plan operated, sponsored, or contributed to by the individual's employer or former employer (or the employer or former employer of the individual's spouse) and ending on the date on which the individual is enrolled in the plan under this section, except that for purposes of making such retroactive adjustments under this clause, such period may not exceed 90 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) No adjustment may be made under subclause (I) with respect to any individual who does not certify that the organization provided the individual with the explanation described in subsection (c)(3)(E) of this section at the time the individual enrolled with the organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) At least 45 days before making the announcement under subparagraph (A) for a year (beginning with the announcement for 1991), the <!-- PDFPage:2261 -->Secretary shall provide for notice to eligible organizations of proposed changes to be made in the methodology or benefit coverage assumptions from the methodology and assumptions used in the previous announcement and shall provide such organizations an opportunity to comment on such proposed changes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In each announcement made under subparagraph (A) for a year (beginning with the announcement for 1991), the Secretary shall include an explanation of the assumptions (including any benefit coverage assumptions) and changes in methodology used in the announcement in sufficient detail so that eligible organizations can compute per capita rates of payment for classes of individuals located in each county (or equivalent area) which is in whole or in part within the service area of such an organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to any eligible organization which has entered into a reasonable cost reimbursement contract, payments shall be made to such plan in accordance with subsection (h)(2) of this section rather than paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to subsections (c)(2)(B)(ii) and (c)(7) of this section, payments under a contract to an eligible organization under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be instead of the amounts which (in the absence of the contract) would be otherwise payable, pursuant to sections 1395f(b) and 1395l(a) of this title, for services furnished by or through the organization to individuals enrolled with the organization under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;adjusted average per capita cost&rdquo; means the average per capita amount that the Secretary estimates in advance (on the basis of actual experience, or retrospective actuarial equivalent based upon an adequate sample and other information and data, in a geographic area served by an eligible organization or in a similar area, with appropriate adjustments to assure actuarial equivalence) would be payable in any contract year for services covered under parts A and B of this subchapter, or part B only, and types of expenses otherwise reimbursable under parts A and B of this subchapter, or part B only (including administrative costs incurred by organizations described in sections 1395h and 1395u of this title), if the services were to be furnished by other than an eligible organization or, in the case of services covered only under section 1395x(s)(2)(H) of this title, if the services were to be furnished by a physician or as an incident to a physician's service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The payment to an eligible organization under this section for individuals enrolled under this section with the organization and entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter and enrolled under part B of this subchapter shall be made from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. The portion of that payment to the organization for a month to be paid by each trust fund shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In regard to expenditures by eligible organizations having risk-sharing contracts, the allocation shall be determined each year by the Secretary based on the relative weight that benefits from each fund contribute to the adjusted average per capita cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In regard to expenditures by eligible organizations operating under a reasonable cost reimbursement contract, the initial allocation shall be based on the plan's most recent budget, such allocation to be adjusted, as needed, after cost settlement to reflect the distribution of actual expenditures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The remainder of that payment shall be paid by the former trust fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Subject to subsections (c)(2)(B)(ii) and (c)(7) of this section, if an individual is enrolled under this section with an eligible organization having a risk-sharing contract, only the eligible organization shall be entitled to receive payments from the Secretary under this subchapter for services furnished to the individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The entity provides physicians&rsquo; services primarily (i) directly through physicians who are either employees or partners of such organization, or (ii) through contracts with individual physicians or one or more groups of physicians (organized on a group practice or individual practice basis).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any provider of services which has filed a required cost report within the time specified in regulations may obtain a hearing with respect to such cost report by a Provider Reimbursement Review Board (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;) which shall be established by the Secretary in accordance with subsection (h) of this section and (except as provided in subsection (g)(2) of this section) any hospital which receives payments in amounts computed under subsection (b) or (d) of section 1395ww of this title and which has submitted such reports within such time as the Secretary may require in order to make payment under such section may obtain a hearing with respect to such payment by the Board, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such provider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) is dissatisfied with a final determination of the organization serving as its fiscal intermediary pursuant to section 1395h of this title as to the amount of total program reimbursement due the provider for the items and services furnished to individuals for which payment may be made under this subchapter for the period covered by such report, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is dissatisfied with a final determination of the Secretary as to the amount of the payment under subsection (b) or (d) of section 1395ww of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has not received such final determination from such intermediary on a timely basis after filing such report, where such report complied with the rules and regulations of the Secretary relating to such report, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) has not received such final determination on a timely basis after filing a supplementary cost report, where such cost report did not so comply and such supplementary cost report did so comply,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount in controversy is $10,000 or more, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such provider files a request for a hearing within 180 days after notice of the intermediary's final determination under paragraph (1)(A)(i), or with respect to appeals under paragraph (1)(A)(ii), 180 days after notice of the Secretary's final determination, or with respect to appeals pursuant to paragraph (1) (B) or (C), within 180 days after notice of such determination would have been received if such determination had been made on a timely basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appeals by groups</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of subsection (a) of this section shall apply to any group of providers of services if each provider of services in such group would, upon the filing of an appeal (but without regard to the $10,000 limitation), be entitled to such a hearing, but only if the matters in controversy involve a common question of fact or interpretation of law or regulations and the amount in controversy is, in the aggregate, $50,000 or more.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Right to counsel; rules of evidence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At such hearing, the provider of services shall have the right to be represented by counsel, to introduce evidence, and to examine and cross-examine witnesses. Evidence may be received at any such hearing even though inadmissible under rules of evidence applicable to court procedure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Decisions of Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A decision by the Board shall be based upon the record made at such hearing, which shall include the evidence considered by the intermediary and such other evidence as may be obtained or received by the Board, and shall be <!-- PDFPage:2291 -->supported by substantial evidence when the record is viewed as a whole. The Board shall have the power to affirm, modify, or reverse a final determination of the fiscal intermediary with respect to a cost report and to make any other revisions on matters covered by such cost report (including revisions adverse to the provider of services) even though such matters were not considered by the intermediary in making such final determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall have full power and authority to make rules and establish procedures, not inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter or regulations of the Secretary, which are necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this section. In the course of any hearing the Board may administer oaths and affirmations. The provisions of subsections (d) and (e) of section 405 of this title with respect to subpenas shall apply to the Board to the same extent as they apply to the Secretary with respect to subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Finality of decision; judicial review; determinations of Board authority; jurisdiction; venue; interest on amount in controversy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A decision of the Board shall be final unless the Secretary, on his own motion, and within 60 days after the provider of services is notified of the Board's decision, reverses, affirms, or modifies the Board's decision. Providers shall have the right to obtain judicial review of any final decision of the Board, or of any reversal, affirmance, or modification by the Secretary, by a civil action commenced within 60 days of the date on which notice of any final decision by the Board or of any reversal, affirmance, or modification by the Secretary is received. Providers shall also have the right to obtain judicial review of any action of the fiscal intermediary which involves a question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy whenever the Board determines (on its own motion or at the request of a provider of services as described in the following sentence) that it is without authority to decide the question, by a civil action commenced within sixty days of the date on which notification of such determination is received. If a provider of services may obtain a hearing under subsection (a) of this section and has filed a request for such a hearing, such provider may file a request for a determination by the Board of its authority to decide the question of law or regulations relevant to the matters in controversy (accompanied by such documents and materials as the Board shall require for purposes of rendering such determination). The Board shall render such determination in writing within thirty days after the Board receives the request and such accompanying documents and materials, and the determination shall be considered a final decision and not subject to review by the Secretary. If the Board fails to render such determination within such period, the provider may bring a civil action (within sixty days of the end of such period) with respect to the matter in controversy contained in such request for a hearing. Such action shall be brought in the district court of the United States for the judicial district in which the provider is located (or, in an action brought jointly by several providers, the judicial district in which the greatest number of such providers are located) or in the District Court for the District of Columbia and shall be tried pursuant to the applicable provisions under chapter 7 of title 5 notwithstanding any other provisions in section 405 of this title. Any appeal to the Board or action for judicial review by providers which are under common ownership or control or which have obtained a hearing under subsection (b) of this section must be brought by such providers as a group with respect to any matter involving an issue common to such providers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Where a provider seeks judicial review pursuant to paragraph (1), the amount in controversy shall be subject to annual interest beginning on the first day of the first month beginning after the 180-day period as determined pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section and equal to the rate of interest on obligations issued for purchase by the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund for the month in which the civil action authorized under paragraph (1) is commenced, to be awarded by the reviewing court in favor of the prevailing party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No interest awarded pursuant to paragraph (2) shall be deemed income or cost for the purposes of determining reimbursement due providers under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Certain findings not reviewable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The finding of a fiscal intermediary that no payment may be made under this subchapter for any expenses incurred for items or services furnished to an individual because such items or services are listed in section 1395y of this title shall not be reviewed by the Board, or by any court pursuant to an action brought under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The determinations and other decisions described in section 1395ww(d)(7) of this title shall not be reviewed by the Board or by any court pursuant to an action brought under subsection (f) of this section or otherwise.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Composition and compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall be composed of five members appointed by the Secretary without regard to the provisions of title 5 governing appointments in the competitive services. Two of such members shall be representative of providers of services. All of the members of the Board shall be persons knowledgeable in the field of payment of providers of services, and at least one of them shall be a certified public accountant. Members of the Board shall be entitled to receive compensation at rates fixed by the Secretary, but not exceeding the rate specified (at the time the service involved is rendered by such members) for grade GS&ndash;18 in section 5332 of title 5. The term of office shall be three years, except that the Secretary shall appoint the initial members of the Board for shorter terms to the extent necessary to permit staggered terms of office.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Technical and clerical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board is authorized to engage such technical assistance as may be required to carry out its functions, and the Secretary shall, in addition, make available to the Board such secretarial, clerical, and other assistance as the Board may require to carry out its functions.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2292 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(j) &ldquo;Provider of services&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;provider of services&rdquo; includes a rural health clinic and a Federally qualified health center.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions prerequisite to payment for items and services notwithstanding determination of disallowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a determination is made that, by reason of section 1395y(a)(1) or (9) of this title or by reason of a coverage denial described in subsection (g) of this section, payment may not be made under part A or part B of this subchapter for any expenses incurred for items or services furnished an individual by a provider of services or by another person pursuant to an assignment under section 1395u(b)(3)(B)(ii) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) both such individual and such provider of services or such other person, as the case may be, did not know, and could not reasonably have been expected to know, that payment would not be made for such items or services under such part A or part B of this subchapter,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then to the extent permitted by this subchapter, payment shall, notwithstanding such determination, be made for such items or services (and for such period of time as the Secretary finds will carry out the objectives of this subchapter), as though section 1395y(a)(1) and section 1395y(a)(9) of this title did not apply and as though the coverage denial described in subsection (g) of this section had not occurred. In each such case the Secretary shall notify both such individual and such provider of services or such other person, as the case may be, of the conditions under which payment for such items or services was made and in the case of comparable situations arising thereafter with respect to such individual or such provider or such other person, each shall, by reason of such notice (or similar notices provided before the enactment of this section), be deemed to have knowledge that payment cannot be made for such items or services or reasonably comparable items or services. Any provider or other person furnishing items or services for which payment may not be made by reason of section 1395y(a)(1) or (9) of this title or by reason of a coverage denial described in subsection (g) of this section shall be deemed to have knowledge that payment cannot be made for such items or services if the claim relating to such items or services involves a case, provider or other person furnishing services, procedure, or test, with respect to which such provider or other person has been notified by the Secretary (including notification by a utilization and quality control peer review organization) that a pattern of inappropriate utilization has occurred in the past, and such provider or other person has been allowed a reasonable time to correct such inappropriate utilization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Knowledge of person or provider that payment could not be made; indemnification of individual</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section are met, except that such provider or such other person, as the case may be, knew, or could be expected to know, that payment for such services or items could not be made under such part A or part B of this subchapter, then the Secretary shall, upon proper application filed within such time as may be prescribed in regulations, indemnify the individual (referred to in such paragraphs) for any payments received from such individual by such provider or such other person, as the case may be, for such items or services. Any payments made by the Secretary as indemnification shall be deemed to have been made to such provider or such other person, as the case may be, and shall be treated as overpayments, recoverable from such provider or such other person, as the case may be, under applicable provisions of law. In each such case the Secretary shall notify such individual of the conditions under which indemnification is made and in the case of comparable situations arising thereafter with respect to such individual, he shall, by reason of such notice (or similar notices provided before the enactment of this section), be deemed to have knowledge that payment cannot be made for such items or services. No item or service for which an individual is indemnified under this subsection shall be taken into account in applying any limitation on the amount of items and services for which payment may be made to or on behalf of the individual under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Knowledge of both provider and individual to whom items or services were furnished that payment could not be made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payments shall be made under this subchapter in any cases in which the provisions of paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of this section are met, but both the individual to whom the items or services were furnished and the provider of service or other person, as the case may be, who furnished the items or services knew, or could reasonably have been expected to know, that payment could not be made for items or services under part A or part B of this subchapter by reason of section 1395y(a)(1) or (a)(9) of this title or by reason of a coverage denial described in subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exercise of rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case arising under subsection (b) of this section (but without regard to whether payments have been made by the individual to the provider or other person) or subsection (c) of this section, the provider or other person shall <!-- PDFPage:2294 -->have the same rights that an individual has under sections 1395ff(b) and 1395u(b)(3)(C) of this title (as may be applicable) when the amount of benefit or payments is in controversy, except that such rights may, under prescribed regulations, be exercised by such provider or other person only after the Secretary determines that the individual will not exercise such rights under such sections.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment where beneficiary not at fault</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where payment for inpatient hospital services or extended care services may not be made under part A of this subchapter on behalf of an individual entitled to benefits under such part solely because of an unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous action with respect to the transfer of such individual from a hospital or skilled nursing facility that meets the requirements of section 1395x(e) or (j) of this title by such a provider of services acting in good faith in accordance with the advice of a utilization review committee, quality control and peer review organization, or fiscal intermediary, or on the basis of a clearly erroneous administrative decision by a provider of services, the Secretary shall take such action with respect to the payment of such benefits as he determines may be necessary to correct the effects of such unintentional, inadvertent, or erroneous action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Presumption with respect to coverage denial; rebuttal; requirements; &ldquo;fiscal intermediary&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A home health agency which meets the applicable requirements of paragraphs (3) and (4) shall be presumed to meet the requirement of subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The presumption of paragraph (1) with respect to specific services may be rebutted by actual or imputed knowledge of the facts described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, including any of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Notice by the fiscal intermediary of the fact that payment may not be made under this subchapter with respect to the services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) It is clear and obvious that the provider should have known at the time the services were furnished that they were excluded from coverage.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The requirements of this paragraph are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The agency complies with requirements of the Secretary under this subchapter respecting timely submittal of bills for payment and medical documentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The agency program has reasonable procedures to notify promptly each patient (and the patient's physician) where it is determined that a patient is being or will be furnished items or services which are excluded from coverage under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The requirement of this paragraph is that, on the basis of bills submitted by a home health agency during the previous quarter, the rate of denial of bills for the agency by reason of a coverage denial described in subsection (g) of this section does not exceed 2.5 percent, computed based on visits for home health services billed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of determining the rate of denial of bills for a home health agency under subparagraph (A), a bill shall not be considered to be denied until the expiration of the 60-day period that begins on the date such bill is denied by the fiscal intermediary, or, with respect to such a denial for which the agency requests reconsideration, until the fiscal intermediary issues a decision denying payment for such bill.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;fiscal intermediary&rdquo; means, with respect to a home health agency, an agency or organization with an agreement under section 1395h of this title with respect to the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary shall monitor the proportion of denied bills submitted by home health agencies for which reconsideration is requested, and shall notify Congress if the proportion of denials reversed upon reconsideration increases significantly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Coverage denial defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The coverage denial described in this subsection is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with respect to the provision of home health services to an individual, a failure to meet the requirements of section 1395f(a)(2)(C) of this title or section 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title in that the individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is or was not confined to his home, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) does or did not need skilled nursing care on an intermittent basis; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with respect to the provision of hospice care to an individual, a determination that the individual is not terminally ill.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Supplier responsibility for items furnished on assignment basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a supplier of medical equipment and supplies (as defined in section 1395m(j)(5) of this title)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) furnishes an item or service to a beneficiary for which no payment may be made by reason of section 1395m(j)(1) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) furnishes an item or service to a beneficiary for which payment is denied in advance under section 1395m(a)(15) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) furnishes an item or service to a beneficiary for which no payment may be made by reason of section 1395m(a)(17)(B) of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">any expenses incurred for items and services furnished to an individual by such a supplier on an assignment-related basis shall be the responsibility of such supplier. The individual shall have no financial responsibility for such expenses and the supplier shall refund on a timely basis to the individual (and shall be liable to the individual for) any amounts collected from the individual for such items or services. The provisions of section 1395m(a)(18) of this title shall apply to refunds required under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to refunds under such section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, payments to which any hospital or skilled nursing facility of the Indian Health Service is entitled by reason of this section shall be placed in a special fund to be held by the Secretary and used by him (to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in appropriation Acts) exclusively for the purpose of making any improvements in the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of such Service which may be necessary to achieve compliance with the applicable conditions and requirements of this subchapter. The preceding sentence shall cease to apply when the Secretary determines and certifies that substantially all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities of such Service in the United States are in compliance with such conditions and requirements.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Type, duration, and scope of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The benefits provided by parts A and B of this subchapter shall include benefits for individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease as provided in section 426&ndash;1 of this title, and benefits for kidney donors as provided in subsection (d) of this section. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the type, duration, and scope of the benefit provided by parts A and B of this subchapter with respect to individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease and who are entitled to such benefits without regard to section 426&ndash;1 of this title shall in no case be less than the type, duration, and scope of the benefits so provided for individuals entitled to such benefits solely by reason of that section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payments with respect to services; dialysis; regulations; physicians&rsquo; services; target reimbursement rates; home dialysis supplies and equipment; self-care home dialysis support services; self-care dialysis units; hepatitis B vaccine</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payments under this subchapter with respect to services, in addition to services for which payment would otherwise be made under this subchapter, furnished to individuals who have been determined to have end stage renal disease shall include (A) payments on behalf of such individuals to providers of services and renal dialysis facilities which meet such requirements as the Secretary shall by regulation prescribe for institutional dialysis services and supplies (including self-dialysis services in a self-care dialysis unit maintained by the provider or facility), transplantation services, self-care home dialysis support services which are furnished by the provider or facility, and routine professional services performed by a physician during a maintenance dialysis episode if payments for his other professional services furnished to an individual who has end stage renal disease are made on the basis specified in paragraph (3)(A) of this subsection, (B) payments to or on behalf of such individuals for home dialysis supplies and equipment, and (C) payments to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician for self-administered erythropoietin as described in section 1395x(s)(2)(P)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395rr_1_target" name="1395rr_1">1</a></sup> of this title if the Secretary finds that the patient receiving such drug from such a supplier can safely and effectively administer the drug (in accordance with the applicable methods and standards established by the Secretary pursuant to such section). The requirements prescribed by the Secretary under subparagraph (A) shall include requirements for a minimum utilization rate for transplantations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) With respect to payments for dialysis services furnished by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease for which payments may be made under part B of this subchapter, such payments (unless otherwise provided in this section) shall be equal to 80 percent of the amounts determined in accordance with subparagraph (B); and with respect to payments for services for which payments may be made under part A of this subchapter, the amounts of such payments (which amounts shall not exceed, in respect to costs in procuring organs attributable to payments made to an organ procurement agency or histocompatibility laboratory, the costs incurred by that agency or laboratory) shall be determined in accordance with section 1395x(v) of this title or section 1395ww of this title (if applicable). Payments shall be made to a renal dialysis facility only if it agrees to accept such payments as payment in full for covered services, except for payment by the individual of 20 percent of the estimated amounts for such services calculated on the basis established by the Secretary under subparagraph (B) and the deductible amount imposed by section 1395<em>l</em>(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall prescribe in regulations any methods and procedures to (i) determine the costs incurred by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities in furnishing covered services to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease, and (ii) determine, on a cost-related basis or other economical and equitable basis (including any basis authorized under section 1395x(v) of this title) and consistent with any regulations promulgated under paragraph (7), the amounts of payments to be made for part B services furnished by such providers and facilities to such individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Such regulations, in the case of services furnished by proprietary providers and facilities (other than hospital outpatient departments) may include, if the Secretary finds it feasible and appropriate, provision for recognition of a reasonable rate of return on equity capital, providing such rate of return does not exceed the rate of return stipulated in section 1395x(v)(1)(B) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of section 1395<em>oo</em> of this title, a renal dialysis facility shall be treated as a provider of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) With respect to payments for physicians&rsquo; services furnished to individuals determined to have end stage renal disease, the Secretary shall pay 80 percent of the amounts calculated for such services&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2298 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) on a reasonable charge basis (but may, in such case, make payment on the basis of the prevailing charges of other physicians for comparable services or, for services furnished on or after January 1, 1992, on the basis described in section 1395w&ndash;4 of this title) except that payment may not be made under this subparagraph for routine services furnished during a maintenance dialysis episode, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) on a comprehensive monthly fee or other basis (which effectively encourages the efficient delivery of dialysis services and provides incentives for the increased use of home dialysis) for an aggregate of services provided over a period of time (as defined in regulations).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Pursuant to agreements with approved providers of services and renal dialysis facilities, the Secretary may make payments to such providers and facilities for the cost of home dialysis supplies and equipment and self-care home dialysis support services furnished to patients whose self-care home dialysis is under the direct supervision of such provider or facility, on the basis of a target reimbursement rate (as defined in paragraph (6)) or on the basis of a method established under paragraph (7).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall make payments to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment furnished to a patient whose self-care home dialysis is not under the direct supervision of an approved provider of services or renal dialysis facility only in accordance with a written agreement under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the patient certifies that the supplier is the sole provider of such supplies and equipment to the patient,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the supplier agrees to receive payment for the cost of such supplies and equipment only on an assignment-related basis, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the supplier certifies that it has entered into a written agreement with an approved provider of services or renal dialysis facility under which such provider or facility agrees to furnish to such patient all self-care home dialysis support services and all other necessary dialysis services and supplies, including institutional dialysis services and supplies and emergency services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) An agreement under paragraph (4) shall require, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, that the provider or facility will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) assume full responsibility for directly obtaining or arranging for the provision of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such medically necessary dialysis equipment as is prescribed by the attending physician;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) dialysis equipment maintenance and repair services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the purchase and delivery of all necessary medical supplies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) where necessary, the services of trained home dialysis aides;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) perform all such administrative functions and maintain such information and records as the Secretary may require to verify the transactions and arrangements described in subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) submit such cost reports, data, and information as the Secretary may require with respect to the costs incurred for equipment, supplies, and services furnished to the facility's home dialysis patient population; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provide for full access for the Secretary to all such records, data, and information as he may require to perform his functions under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary shall establish, for each calendar year, commencing with January 1, 1979, a target reimbursement rate for home dialysis which shall be adjusted for regional variations in the cost of providing home dialysis. In establishing such a rate, the Secretary shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary's estimate of the cost of providing medically necessary home dialysis supplies and equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an allowance, in an amount determined by the Secretary, to cover the cost of providing personnel to aid in home dialysis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an allowance, in an amount determined by the Secretary, to cover administrative costs and to provide an incentive for the efficient delivery of home dialysis;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but in no event (except as may be provided in regulations under paragraph (7)) shall such target rate exceed 75 percent of the national average payment, adjusted for regional variations, for maintenance dialysis services furnished in approved providers and facilities during the preceding fiscal year. Any such target rate so established shall be utilized, without renegotiation of the rate, throughout the calendar year for which it is established. During the last quarter of each calendar year, the Secretary shall establish a home dialysis target reimbursement rate for the next calendar year based on the most recent data available to the Secretary at the time. In establishing any rate under this paragraph, the Secretary may utilize a competitive-bid procedure, a prenegotiated rate procedure, or any other procedure (including methods established under paragraph (7)) which the Secretary determines is appropriate and feasible in order to carry out this paragraph in an effective and efficient manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall provide by regulation for a method (or methods) for determining prospectively the amounts of payments to be made for dialysis services furnished by providers of services and renal dialysis facilities to individuals in a facility and to such individuals at home. Such method (or methods) shall provide for the prospective determination of a rate (or rates) for each mode of care based on a single composite weighted formula (which takes into account the mix of patients who receive dialysis services at a facility or at home and the relative costs of providing such services in such settings) for hospital-based facilities and such a single composite weighted formula for other renal dialysis facilities, or based on such other method or combination of methods which differentiate between hospital-based facilities and other renal dialysis facilities and which the Secretary determines, after detailed analysis, will more effectively encourage the more efficient delivery of dialysis services and will provide greater incentives for increased use of home dialysis than through the single composite weighted formulas. The amount of a payment made under <!-- PDFPage:2299 -->any method other than a method based on a single composite weighted formula may not exceed the amount (or, in the case of continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis, 130 percent of the amount) of the median payment that would have been made under the formula for hospital-based facilities. The Secretary shall provide for such exceptions to such methods as may be warranted by unusual circumstances (including the special circumstances of sole facilities located in isolated, rural areas and of pediatric facilities). Each application for such an exception shall be deemed to be approved unless the Secretary disapproves it by not later than 60 working days after the date the application is filed. The Secretary may provide that such method will serve in lieu of any target reimbursement rate that would otherwise be established under paragraph (6). The Secretary shall reduce the amount of each composite rate payment under this paragraph for each treatment by 50 cents (subject to such adjustments as may be required to reflect modes of dialysis other than hemodialysis) and provide for payment of such amount to the organizations (designated under subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section) for such organizations&rsquo; necessary and proper administrative costs incurred in carrying out the responsibilities described in subsection (c)(2) of this section. The Secretary shall provide that amounts paid under the previous sentence shall be distributed to the organizations described in subsection (c)(1)(A) of this section to ensure equitable treatment of all such network organizations. The Secretary in distributing any such payments to network organizations shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the geographic size of the network area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the number of providers of end stage renal disease services in the network area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the number of individuals who are entitled to end stage renal disease services in the network area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the proportion of the aggregate administrative funds collected in the network area.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall increase the amount of each composite rate payment for dialysis services furnished during 2000 by 1.2 percent above such composite rate payment amounts for such services furnished on December 31, 1999, and for such services furnished on or after January 1, 2001, by 2.4 percent above such composite rate payment amounts for such services furnished on December 31, 2000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;home dialysis supplies and equipment&rdquo; means medically necessary supplies and equipment (including supportive equipment) required by an individual suffering from end stage renal disease in connection with renal dialysis carried out in his home (as defined in regulations), including obtaining, installing, and maintaining such equipment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;self-care home dialysis support services&rdquo;, to the extent permitted in regulation, means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) periodic monitoring of the patient's home adaptation, including visits by qualified provider or facility personnel (as defined in regulations), so long as this is done in accordance with a plan prepared and periodically reviewed by a professional team (as defined in regulations) including the individual's physician;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) installation and maintenance of dialysis equipment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) testing and appropriate treatment of the water; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such additional supportive services as the Secretary finds appropriate and desirable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(10) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;self-care dialysis unit&rdquo; means a renal dialysis facility or a distinct part of such facility or of a provider of services, which has been approved by the Secretary to make self-dialysis services, as defined by the Secretary in regulations, available to individuals who have been trained for self-dialysis. A self-care dialysis unit must, at a minimum, furnish the services, equipment and supplies needed for self-care dialysis, have patient-staff ratios which are appropriate to self-dialysis (allowing for such appropriate lesser degree of ongoing medical supervision and assistance of ancillary personnel than is required for full care maintenance dialysis), and meet such other requirements as the Secretary may prescribe with respect to the quality and cost-effectiveness of services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(11)(A) Hepatitis B vaccine and its administration, when provided to a patient determined to have end stage renal disease, shall not be included as dialysis services for purposes of payment under any prospective payment amount or comprehensive fee established under this section. Payment for such vaccine and its administration shall be made separately in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Erythropoietin, when provided to a patient determined to have end stage renal disease, shall not be included as a dialysis service for purposes of payment under any prospective payment amount or comprehensive fee established under this section, and payment for such item shall be made separately&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of erythropoietin provided by a physician, in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em> of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of erythropoietin provided by a provider of services, renal dialysis facility, or other supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) for erythropoietin provided during 1994, in an amount equal to $10 per thousand units (rounded to the nearest 100 units), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) for erythropoietin provided during a subsequent year, in an amount determined to be appropriate by the Secretary, except that such amount may not exceed the amount determined under this clause for the previous year increased by the percentage increase (if any) in the implicit price deflator for gross national product (as published by the Department of Commerce) for the second quarter of the preceding year over the implicit price deflator for the second quarter of the second preceding year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The amount payable to a supplier of home dialysis supplies and equipment that is not a provider of services, a renal dialysis facility, or a physician for erythropoietin shall be determined in the same manner as the amount payable to a renal dialysis facility for such item.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2300 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Renal disease network areas; coordinating councils, executive committees, and medical review boards; national end stage renal disease medical information system; functions of network organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) For the purpose of assuring effective and efficient administration of the benefits provided under this section, the Secretary shall, in accordance with such criteria as he finds necessary to assure the performance of the responsibilities and functions specified in paragraph (2)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) establish at least 17 end stage renal disease network areas, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) for each such area, designate a network administrative organization which, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, shall establish (aa) a network council of renal dialysis and transplant facilities located in the area and (bb) a medical review board, which has a membership including at least one patient representative and physicians, nurses, and social workers engaged in treatment relating to end stage renal disease.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register a description of the geographic area that he determines, after consultation with appropriate professional and patient organizations, constitutes each network area and the criteria on the basis of which such determination is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) In order to determine whether the Secretary should enter into, continue, or terminate an agreement with a network administrative organization designated for an area established under clause (i), the Secretary shall develop and publish in the Federal Register standards, criteria, and procedures to evaluate an applicant organization's capabilities to perform (and, in the case of an organization with which such an agreement is in effect, actual performance of) the responsibilities described in paragraph (2). The Secretary shall evaluate each applicant based on quality and scope of services and may not accord more than 20 percent of the weight of the evaluation to the element of price.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) An agreement with a network administrative organization may be terminated by the Secretary only if he finds, after applying such standards and criteria, that the organization has failed to perform its prescribed responsibilities effectively and efficiently.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Submission of policy by insurer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish a procedure whereby medicare supplemental policies (as de<!-- PDFPage:2309 -->fined in subsection (g)(1) of this section) may be certified by the Secretary as meeting minimum standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Such procedure shall provide an opportunity for any insurer to submit any such policy, and such additional data as the Secretary finds necessary, to the Secretary for his examination and for his certification thereof as meeting the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Subject to subsections (k)(3), (m), and (n) of this section, such certification shall remain in effect if the insurer files a notarized statement with the Secretary no later than June 30 of each year stating that the policy continues to meet such standards and requirements and if the insurer submits such additional data as the Secretary finds necessary to independently verify the accuracy of such notarized statement. Where the Secretary determines such a policy meets (or continues to meet) such standards and requirements, he shall authorize the insurer to have printed on such policy (but only in accordance with such requirements and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe) an emblem which the Secretary shall cause to be designed for use as an indication that a policy has received the Secretary's certification. The Secretary shall provide each State commissioner or superintendent of insurance with a list of all the policies which have received his certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No medicare supplemental policy may be issued in a State on or after the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State's regulatory program under subsection (b)(1) of this section provides for the application and enforcement of the standards and requirements set forth in such subsection (including the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation (as the case may be)) by the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the State's program does not provide for the application and enforcement of such standards and requirements, the policy has been certified by the Secretary under paragraph (1) as meeting the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section (including such applicable standards) by such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any person who issues a medicare supplemental policy, on and after the effective date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section, in violation of this paragraph is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standards and requirements; periodic review by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any medicare supplemental policy issued in any State which the Secretary determines has established under State law a regulatory program that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provides for the application and enforcement of standards with respect to such policies equal to or more stringent than the NAIC Model Standards (as defined in subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section), except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (H);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) includes requirements equal to or more stringent than the requirements described in paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (c) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) information with respect to the actual ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected under such policies will be reported to the State on forms conforming to those developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for such purpose, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such ratios will be monitored under the program in an alternative manner approved by the Secretary, and that a copy of each such policy, the most recent premium for each such policy, and a listing of the ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected for the most recent 3-year period for each such policy issued or sold in the State is maintained and made available to interested persons;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provides for application and enforcement of the standards and requirements described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to all medicare supplemental policies (as defined in subsection (g)(1) of this section) issued in such State,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) provides the Secretary periodically (but at least annually) with a list containing the name and address of the issuer of each such policy and the name and number of each such policy (including an indication of policies that have been previously approved, newly approved, or withdrawn from approval since the previous list was provided),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) reports to the Secretary on the implementation and enforcement of standards and requirements of this paragraph at intervals established by the Secretary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) provides for a process for approving or disapproving proposed premium increases with respect to such policies, and establishes a policy for the holding of public hearings prior to approval of a premium increase, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary periodically shall review State regulatory programs to determine if they continue to meet the standards and requirements specified in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that a State regulatory program no longer meets the standards and requirements, before making a final determination, the Secretary shall provide the State an opportunity to adopt such a plan of correction as would permit the State regulatory program to continue to meet such standards and requirements. If the Secretary makes a final determination that the State regulatory program, after such an opportunity, fails to meet such standards and requirements, the program shall no longer be considered to have in operation a program meeting such standards and requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a medicare supplemental policy offered in a State shall not be deemed to meet the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section, with respect to an advertisement (whether through written, radio, or television medium) used (or, at a State's option, to be used) for the policy in the State, unless the entity issuing the policy provides a copy of each advertisement to the Commissioner of Insurance (or comparable officer identified by the Secretary) of that State for review or approval to the extent it may be required under State law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requisite findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall certify under this section any medicare supplemental policy, or continue certification of such a policy, only if he finds that such policy (or, with respect to paragraph (3) or the requirement described in subsection (s) of this section, the issuer of the policy)&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Hospital facility agreements; reasonable costs of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any hospital which has an agreement under section 1395cc of this title may (subject to subsection (b) of this section) enter into an agreement with the Secretary under which its inpatient hospital facilities may be used for the furnishing of services of the type which, if furnished by a skilled nursing facility, would constitute extended care services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, payment to any hospital (other than a critical access hospital) for services furnished under an agreement entered into under this section shall be based upon the reasonable cost of the services as determined under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The reasonable cost of the services consists of the reasonable cost of routine services (determined under clause (ii)) and the reasonable cost of ancillary services (determined under clause (iii)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The reasonable cost of routine services furnished during any calendar year by a hospital under an agreement under this section is equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the number of patient-days during the year for which the services were furnished, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the average reasonable cost per patient-day, such average reasonable cost per patient-day being the average rate per patient-day paid for routine services during the most recent year for which cost reporting data are available with respect to such services (increased in a compounded manner by the applicable increase for payments for routine service costs of skilled nursing facilities under subsections (a) through (d) of section 1395yy of this title for subsequent cost reporting periods and up to and including such calendar year) under this subchapter to freestanding skilled <!-- PDFPage:2332 -->nursing facilities in the region (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title) in which the facility is located.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The reasonable cost of ancillary services shall be determined in the same manner as the reasonable cost of ancillary services provided for inpatient hospital services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, a critical access hospital shall be paid for covered skilled nursing facility services furnished under an agreement entered into under this section on the basis of the reasonable costs of such services (as determined under section 1395x(v) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not enter into an agreement under this section with any hospital unless, except as provided under subsection (g) of this section, the hospital is located in a rural area and has less than 100 beds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms and conditions of facility agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An agreement with a hospital under this section shall, except as otherwise provided under regulations of the Secretary, be of the same duration and subject to termination on the same conditions as are agreements with skilled nursing facilities under section 1395cc of this title and shall, where not inconsistent with any provision of this section, impose the same duties, responsibilities, conditions, and limitations, as those imposed under such agreements entered into under section 1395cc of this title; except that no such agreement with any hospital shall be in effect for any period during which the hospital does not have in effect an agreement under section 1395cc of this title. A hospital with respect to which an agreement under this section has been terminated shall not be eligible to enter into a new agreement until a two-year period has elapsed from the termination date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Post-hospital extended care services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any agreement with a hospital under this section shall provide that payment for services will be made only for services for which payment would be made as post-hospital extended care services if those services had been furnished by a skilled nursing facility under an agreement entered into under section 1395cc of this title; and any individual who is furnished services, for which payment may be made under an agreement under this section, shall, for purposes of this subchapter (other than this section), be deemed to have received post-hospital extended care services in like manner and to the same extent as if the services furnished to him had been post-hospital extended care services furnished by a skilled nursing facility under an agreement under section 1395cc of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reimbursement for routine hospital services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During a period for which a hospital has in effect an agreement under this section, in order to allocate routine costs between hospital and long-term care services for purposes of determining payment for inpatient hospital services, the total reimbursement due for routine services from all classes of long-term care patients (including this subchapter, subchapter XIX of this chapter, and private pay patients) shall be subtracted from the hospital's total routine costs before calculations are made to determine this subchapter reimbursement for routine hospital services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Conditions applicable to skilled nursing facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A hospital which enters into an agreement with the Secretary under this section shall be required to meet those conditions applicable to skilled nursing facilities relating to discharge planning and the social services function (and staffing requirements to satisfy it) which are promulgated by the Secretary under section 1395i&ndash;3 of this title. Services furnished by such a hospital which would otherwise constitute post-hospital extended care services if furnished by a skilled nursing facility shall be subject to the same requirements applicable to such services when furnished by a skilled nursing facility except for those requirements the Secretary determines are inappropriate in the case of these services being furnished by a hospital under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Agreements on demonstration basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may enter into an agreement under this section on a demonstration basis with any hospital which does not meet the requirement of subsection (b)(1) of this section, if the hospital otherwise meets the requirements of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) The Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments that may be made under this subchapter with respect to operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in paragraph (4)) shall not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of health services) costs for the provision of such services by a hospital for a cost reporting period to the extent such costs exceed the applicable percentage (as determined under clause (ii)) of the average of such costs for all hospitals in the same grouping as such hospital for comparable time periods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percentage for hospital cost reporting periods beginning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) on or after October 1, 1982, and before October 1, 1983, is 120 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) on or after October 1, 1983, and before October 1, 1984, is 115 percent; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) For purposes of subparagraph (A) the Secretary shall establish case mix indexes for all short-term hospitals, and shall set limits for each hospital based upon the general mix of types of medical cases with respect to which such hospital provides services for which payment may be made under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall set such limits for a cost reporting period of a hospital&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) by updating available data for a previous period to the immediate preceding cost reporting period by the estimated average rate of change of hospital costs industry-wide, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) by projecting for the cost reporting period by the applicable percentage increase (as defined in subsection (b)(3)(B) of this section).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The limitation established under subparagraph (A) for any hospital shall in no event be lower than the allowable operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in paragraph (4)) recognized under this subchapter for such hospital for such hospital's last cost reporting period prior to the hospital's first cost reporting period for which this section is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall provide for such exemptions from, and exceptions and adjustments to, the limitation established under paragraph (1)(A) as he deems appropriate, including those which he deems necessary to take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the special needs of sole community hospitals, of new hospitals, of risk based health maintenance organizations, and of hospitals which provide atypical services or essential community services, and to take into account extraordinary circumstances beyond the hospital's control, medical and paramedical education costs, significantly fluctuating population in the service area of the hospital, and unusual labor costs,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the special needs of psychiatric hospitals and of public or other hospitals that serve a significantly disproportionate number of patients who have low income or are entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a decrease in the inpatient hospital services that a hospital provides and that are customarily provided directly by similar hospitals which results in a significant distortion in the operating costs of inpatient hospital services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The limitation established under paragraph (1)(A) shall not apply with respect to any hospital which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is located outside of a standard metropolitan statistical area, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) has less than 50 beds, and</p>

If the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subparagraph (C) are based on main<!-- PDFPage:2343 -->taining payment amounts at no more than a specified percentage increase above the payment amounts in a base period, the State has the option of applying such test (for inpatient hospital services under part A of this subchapter) on an aggregate payment basis or on the basis of the amount of payment per inpatient discharge or admission. If the Secretary determines that the conditions described in subparagraph (C) are based on maintaining aggregate payment amounts below a national average percentage increase in total payments under part A of this subchapter for inpatient hospital services, the Secretary cannot deny the application of a State under this subsection on the ground that the State's rate of increase in such payments for such services must be less than such national average rate of increase.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining under paragraph (1)(C) the amount of payment which would otherwise have been made under this subchapter for a State, the Secretary may provide for appropriate adjustment of such amount to take into account previous reductions effected in the amount of payments made under this subchapter in the State due to the operation of the hospital reimbursement control system in the State if the system has resulted in an aggregate rate of increase in operating costs of inpatient hospital services (as defined in subsection (a)(4) of this section) under this subchapter for hospitals in the State which is less than the aggregate rate of increase in such costs under this subchapter for hospitals in the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall approve the request of a State under paragraph (1) with respect to a hospital reimbursement control system if&mdash;</p>

With respect to discharges occurring on or after October 1, 1987, the Secretary shall compute urban and rural averages on the basis of discharge weighting rather than hospital weighting, making appropriate adjustments to ensure that computation on such basis does not result in total payments under this section that are greater or less than the total payments that would have been made under this section but for this sentence, and making appropriate changes in the manner of determining the reductions under subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>

Not later than October 1, 1990, and October 1, 1993 (and at least every 12 months thereafter), the Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of a survey conducted by the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs of subsection (d) hospitals in the United States. Not less often than once every 3 years the Secretary (through such survey or otherwise) shall measure the earnings and paid hours of employment by occupational category and shall exclude data with respect to the wages and wage-related costs incurred in furnishing skilled nursing facility services. Any adjustments or updates made under this subparagraph for a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1991) shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate payments under this subsection in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made in the year without such adjustment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For discharges in fiscal year 1990, the Secretary shall reduce the weighting factor for each diagnosis-related group by 1.22 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Any such adjustment under clause (i) for discharges in a fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 1991) shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregate payments under this subsection for discharges in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made for discharges in the year without such adjustment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) The Secretary shall provide for such exceptions and adjustments to the payment amounts established under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the special needs of regional and national referral centers (including those hospitals of 275 or more beds located in rural areas). A hospital which is classified as a rural hospital may appeal to the Secretary to be classified as a rural referral center under this clause on the basis of criteria (established by the Secretary) which shall allow the hospital to demonstrate that it should be so reclassified by reason of certain of its operating characteristics being similar to those of a typical urban hospital located in the same census region and which shall not require a rural osteopathic hospital to have more than 3,000 discharges in a year in order to be classified as a rural referral center. Such characteristics may include wages, scope of services, service area, and the mix of medical specialties. The Secretary shall publish the criteria not later than August 17, 1984, for implementation by October 1, 1984. An appeal allowed under this clause must be submitted to the Secretary (in such form and manner as the Secretary may prescribe) during the quarter before the first quarter of the hospital's cost reporting period (or, in the case of a cost reporting period beginning during October 1984, during the first quarter of that period), and the Secretary must make a final determination with respect to such appeal within 60 days after the date the appeal was submitted. Any payment adjustments necessitated by a reclassification based upon the appeal shall be effective at the beginning of such cost reporting period.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) For any cost reporting period beginning on or after April 1, 1990, with respect to a subsection (d) hospital which is a sole community hospital, payment under paragraph (1)(A) shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) an amount based on 100 percent of the hospital's target amount for the cost reporting period, as defined in subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever results in greater payment to the hospital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of a sole community hospital that experiences, in a cost reporting period compared to the previous cost reporting period, a decrease of more than 5 percent in its total number of inpatient cases due to circumstances beyond its control, the Secretary shall provide for such adjustment to the payment amounts under this subsection (other than under paragraph (9)) as may be necessary to fully compensate the hospital for the fixed costs it incurs in the period in providing inpatient hospital services, including the reasonable cost of maintaining necessary core staff and services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Secretary shall promulgate a standard for determining whether a hospital meets the criteria for classification as a sole community hospital under clause (iii)(II) because of the time required for an individual to travel to the nearest alternative source of appropriate inpatient care.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The Secretary shall estimate the amount of reimbursement made for services described in section 1395y(a)(14) of this title with respect to which payment was made under part B of this subchapter in the base reporting periods referred to in paragraph (2)(A) and with respect to which payment is no longer being made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) For discharges occurring on or after May 1, 1986, the Secretary shall provide, in accordance with this subparagraph, for an additional payment amount for each subsection (d) hospital which&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Subject to clause (ix), the amount of such payment for each discharge shall be determined by multiplying (I) the sum of the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(ii)(II) (or, if applicable, the amount determined under paragraph (1)(A)(iii)) and, for cases qualifying for additional payment under subparagraph (A)(i), the amount paid to the hospital under subparagraph (A) for that discharge, by (II) the disproportionate share adjustment percentage established under clause (iii) or (iv) for the cost reporting period in which the discharge occurs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each case mix group the Secretary shall assign an appropriate weighting which reflects the relative facility resources used with respect to patients classified within that group compared to patients classified within other groups.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustments for case mix</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall from time to time adjust the classifications and weighting factors established under this paragraph as appropriate to reflect changes in treatment patterns, technology, case mix, number of payment units for which payment is made under this subchapter, and other fac<!-- PDFPage:2368 -->tors which may affect the relative use of resources. Such adjustments shall be made in a manner so that changes in aggregate payments under the classification system are a result of real changes and are not a result of changes in coding that are unrelated to real changes in case mix.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Insofar as the Secretary determines that such adjustments for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under the classification system during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of patients that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary shall adjust the per payment unit payment rate for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Data collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary is authorized to require rehabilitation facilities that provide inpatient hospital services to submit such data as the Secretary deems necessary to establish and administer the prospective payment system under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment rate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall determine a prospective payment rate for each payment unit for which such rehabilitation facility is entitled to receive payment under this subchapter. Subject to subparagraph (B), such rate for payment units occurring during a fiscal year shall be based on the average payment per payment unit under this subchapter for inpatient operating and capital costs of rehabilitation facilities using the most recent data available (as estimated by the Secretary as of the date of establishment of the system) adjusted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by updating such per-payment-unit amount to the fiscal year involved by the weighted average of the applicable percentage increases provided under subsection (b)(3)(B)(ii) of this section (for cost reporting periods beginning during the fiscal year) covering the period from the midpoint of the period for such data through the midpoint of fiscal year 2000 and by an increase factor (described in subparagraph (C)) specified by the Secretary for subsequent fiscal years up to the fiscal year involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by reducing such rates by a factor equal to the proportion of payments under this subsection (as estimated by the Secretary) based on prospective payment amounts which are additional payments described in paragraph (4) (relating to outlier and related payments);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for variations among rehabilitation facilities by area under paragraph (6);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) by the weighting factors established under paragraph (2)(B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) by such other factors as the Secretary determines are necessary to properly reflect variations in necessary costs of treatment among rehabilitation facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Budget neutral rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish the prospective payment amounts under this subsection for payment units during fiscal years 2001 and 2002 at levels such that, in the Secretary's estimation, the amount of total payments under this subsection for such fiscal years (including any payment adjustments pursuant to paragraphs (4) and (6) but not taking into account any payment adjustment resulting from an election permitted under paragraph (1)(F)) shall be equal to 98 percent for fiscal year 2001 and 100 percent for fiscal year 2002 of the amount of payments that would have been made under this subchapter during the fiscal years for operating and capital costs of rehabilitation facilities had this subsection not been enacted. In establishing such payment amounts, the Secretary shall consider the effects of the prospective payment system established under this subsection on the total number of payment units from rehabilitation facilities and other factors described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Increase factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this subsection for payment units in each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001), the Secretary shall establish an increase factor. Such factor shall be based on an appropriate percentage increase in a market basket of goods and services comprising services for which payment is made under this subsection, which may be the market basket percentage increase described in subsection (b)(3)(B)(iii) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Outlier and special payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Outliers</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may provide for an additional payment to a rehabilitation facility for patients in a case mix group, based upon the patient being classified as an outlier based on an unusual length of stay, costs, or other factors specified by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payment based on marginal cost of care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount of such additional payment under clause (i) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the cutoff point applicable under clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Total payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The total amount of the additional payments made under this subparagraph for payment units in a fiscal year may not exceed 5 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on prospective payment rates for payment units in that year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may provide for such adjustments to the payment amounts under <!-- PDFPage:2369 -->this subsection as the Secretary deems appropriate to take into account the unique circumstances of rehabilitation facilities located in Alaska and Hawaii.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, on or before August 1 before each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2001), of the classification and weighting factors for case mix groups under paragraph (2) for such fiscal year and a description of the methodology and data used in computing the prospective payment rates under this subsection for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Area wage adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall adjust the proportion (as estimated by the Secretary from time to time) of rehabilitation facilities&rsquo; costs which are attributable to wages and wage-related costs, of the prospective payment rates computed under paragraph (3) for area differences in wage levels by a factor (established by the Secretary) reflecting the relative hospital wage level in the geographic area of the rehabilitation facility compared to the national average wage level for such facilities. Not later than October 1, 2001 (and at least every 36 months thereafter), the Secretary shall update the factor under the preceding sentence on the basis of information available to the Secretary (and updated as appropriate) of the wages and wage-related costs incurred in furnishing rehabilitation services. Any adjustments or updates made under this paragraph for a fiscal year shall be made in a manner that assures that the aggregated payments under this subsection in the fiscal year are not greater or less than those that would have been made in the year without such adjustment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation on review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title, 1395<em>oo</em> of this title, or otherwise of the establishment of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) case mix groups, of the methodology for the classification of patients within such groups, and of the appropriate weighting factors thereof under paragraph (2),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the prospective payment rates under paragraph (3),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) outlier and special payments under paragraph (4), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) area wage adjustments under paragraph (6).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Payment to nonhospital providers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, the Secretary may establish rules for payment to qualified nonhospital providers for their direct costs of medical education, if those costs are incurred in the operation of an approved medical residency training program described in subsection (h) of this section. Such rules shall specify the amounts, form, and manner in which such payments will be made and the portion of such payments that will be made from each of the trust funds under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Qualified nonhospital providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;qualified nonhospital providers&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a Federally&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395ww_12_target" name="1395ww_12">12</a></sup> qualified health center, as defined in section 1395x(aa)(4) of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Medicare+Choice organizations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such other providers (other than hospitals) as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Payment for nursing and allied health education for managed care enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For portions of cost reporting periods occurring in a year (beginning with 2000), the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment amount for any hospital that receives payments for the costs of approved educational activities for nurse and allied health professional training under section 1395x(v)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The additional payment amount under this subsection for each hospital for portions of cost reporting periods occurring in a year shall be an amount specified by the Secretary in a manner consistent with the following:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determination of managed care enrollee payment ratio for graduate medical education payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall estimate the ratio of payments for all hospitals for portions of cost reporting periods occurring in the year under subsection (h)(3)(D) of this section to total direct graduate medical education payments estimated for such portions of periods under subsection (h)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application to fee-for-service nursing and allied health education payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such ratio shall be applied to the Secretary's estimate of total payments for nursing and allied health education determined under section 1395x(v) of this title for portions of cost reporting periods occurring in the year to determine a total amount of additional payments for nursing and allied health education to be distributed to hospitals under this subsection for portions of cost reporting periods occurring in the year; except that in no case shall such total amount exceed $60,000,000 in any year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application to hospital</h4>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Criteria; amount of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall by regulation determine criteria for distinguishing those services (including inpatient and outpatient services) rendered in hospitals or skilled nursing facilities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) which constitute professional medical services, which are personally rendered for an individual patient by a physician and which contribute to the diagnosis or treatment of an individual patient, and which may be reimbursed as physicians&rsquo; services under part B, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which constitute professional services which are rendered for the general benefit to patients in a hospital or skilled nursing facility and which may be reimbursed only on a reasonable cost basis or on the bases described in section 1395ww of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of cost reimbursement, the Secretary shall recognize as a reasonable cost of a hospital or skilled nursing facility only that portion of the costs attributable to services rendered by a physician in such hospital or facility which are services described in paragraph (1)(B), apportioned on the basis of the amount of time actually spent by such physician rendering such services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining the amount of the payments which may be made with respect to services described in paragraph (1)(B), after apportioning costs as required by subparagraph (A), the Secretary may not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of health services) such portion of the provider's costs for such services to the extent that such costs exceed the reasonable compensation equivalent for such services. The reasonable compensation equivalent for any service shall be established by the Secretary in regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may, upon a showing by a hospital or facility that it is unable to recruit or maintain an adequate number of physicians for the hospital or facility on account of the reimbursement limits established under this subsection, grant exceptions to such reimbursement limits as may be necessary to allow such provider to provide a compensation level sufficient to provide adequate physician services in such hospital or facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prohibition of recognition of payments under certain percentage agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), in the case of a provider of services which is paid under this subchapter on a reasonable cost basis, or other basis related to costs that are reasonable, and which has entered into a contract for the purpose of having services furnished for or on behalf of it, the Secretary may not include any cost incurred by the provider under the contract if the amount payable under the contract by the provider for that cost is determined on the basis of a percentage (or other proportion) of the provider's charges, revenues, or claim for reimbursement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to services furnished by a physician and described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section and covered by regulations in effect under subsection (a) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) under regulations established by the Secretary, where the amount involved under the percentage contract is reasonable and the contract&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is a customary commercial business practice, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provides incentives for the efficient and economical operation of the provider of services.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1395yy. Payment to skilled nursing facilities for routine service costs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Per diem limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in determining the amount of the payments which may be made under this subchapter with respect to routine service costs of extended care services shall not recognize as reasonable (in the efficient delivery of health services) per diem costs of such services to the extent that such per diem costs exceed the following per diem limits, except as otherwise provided in this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) With respect to freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas, the limit shall be equal to 112 percent of the mean per diem routine service costs for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) With respect to freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas, the limit shall be equal to 112 percent of the mean per diem routine service costs for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) With respect to hospital-based skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas, the limit shall be equal to the sum of the limit for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas, plus 50 percent of the amount by which 112 percent of the mean per diem routine service costs for hospital-based skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas exceeds the limit for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in urban areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) With respect to hospital-based skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas, the limit shall be equal to the sum of the limit for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas, plus 50 percent of the amount by which 112 percent of the mean per diem routine service costs for hospital-based skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas exceeds the limit for freestanding skilled nursing facilities located in rural areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In applying this subsection the Secretary shall make appropriate adjustments to the labor related portion of the costs based upon an appropriate wage index, and shall, for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1992, on or after October 1, 1995, and every 2 years thereafter, provide for an update to the per diem cost limits described in this subsection, except that the limits effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1997, shall be based on the limits effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Excess overhead allocations for hospital-based facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a hospital-based skilled nursing facility, the Secretary may not recognize as reasonable the portion of the cost differences between hospital-based and freestanding skilled nursing facilities attributable to excess overhead allocations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Adjustments in limitations; publication of data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make adjustments in the limits set forth in subsection (a) of this section with respect to any skilled nursing facility to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate, based upon case mix or circumstances beyond the control of the facility. The Secretary shall publish the data and criteria to be used for purposes of this subsection on an annual basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Access to skilled nursing facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to subsection (e) of this section, any skilled nursing facility may choose to be paid under this subsection on the basis of a prospective payment for all routine service costs (including the costs of services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident eligible for benefits under this subchapter) and capital-related costs of extended care services provided in a cost reporting period if such facility had, in the preceding cost reporting period, fewer than 1,500 patient days with respect to which payments were made under this subchapter. Such prospective payment shall be in lieu of payments which would otherwise be made for routine service costs pursuant to section 1395x(v) of this title and subsections (a) through (c) of this section and capital-related costs pursuant to section 1395x(v) of this title. This subsection shall not apply to a facility for any cost reporting period immediately following a cost reporting period in which such facility had 1,500 or more patient days with respect to which payments were made under this subchapter, without regard to whether payments were made under this subsection during such preceding cost reporting period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of the payment under this section shall be determined on a per diem basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to the limitations of subparagraph (C), for skilled nursing facilities located&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in an urban area, the amount shall be equal to 105 percent of the mean of the per diem reasonable routine service and capital-related costs of extended care services for skilled nursing facilities in urban areas within the same region, determined without regard to the limitations of subsection (a) of this section and adjusted for different area wage levels, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2412 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in a rural area the amount shall be equal to 105 percent of the mean of the per diem reasonable routine service and capital-related costs of extended care services for skilled nursing facilities in rural areas within the same region, determined without regard to the limitations of subsection (a) of this section and adjusted for different area wage levels.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The per diem amounts determined under subparagraph (B) shall not exceed the limit on routine service costs determined under subsection (a) of this section with respect to the facility, adjusted to take into account average capital-related costs with respect to the type and location of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, urban and rural areas shall be determined in the same manner as for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, and the term &ldquo;region&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as under section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall establish the prospective payment amounts for cost reporting periods beginning in a fiscal year at least 90 days prior to the beginning of such fiscal year, on the basis of the most recent data available for a 12-month period. A skilled nursing facility must notify the Secretary of its intention to be paid pursuant to this subsection for a cost reporting period no later than 30 days before the beginning of that period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary shall provide for a simplified cost report to be filed by facilities being paid pursuant to this subsection, which shall require only the cost information necessary for determining prospective payment amounts pursuant to paragraph (2) and reasonable costs of ancillary services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In lieu of payment on a cost basis for ancillary services provided by a facility which is being paid pursuant to this subsection, the Secretary may pay for such ancillary services on a reasonable charge basis if the Secretary determines that such payment basis will provide an equitable level of reimbursement and will ease the reporting burden of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) In computing the rates of payment to be made under this subsection, there shall be taken into account the costs described in the last sentence of section 1395x(v)(1)(E) of this title (relating to compliance with nursing facility requirements and of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs and competency evaluation programs).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall compute a weighted average per diem rate for freestanding facilities by computing an average of the standardized amounts computed under subparagraph (C) only for such facilities, weighted for each facility by the number of days of extended care services furnished during the cost reporting period referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Separate computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may compute and apply such averages separately for facilities located in urban and rural areas (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Updating</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Initial period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For the initial period beginning on July 1, 1998, and ending on September 30, 1999, the Secretary shall compute for skilled nursing facilities an unadjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the average of the weighted average per diem rates computed under clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (D), increased by skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for such period minus 1 percentage point.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Subsequent fiscal years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall compute an unadjusted Federal per diem rate equal to the Federal per diem rate computed under this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for fiscal year 2000, the rate computed for the initial period described in clause (i), increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the initial period minus 1 percentage point;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for fiscal year 2001, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) for each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year involved minus 0.5 percentage points; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) for each subsequent fiscal year, the rate computed for the previous fiscal year increased by the skilled nursing facility market basket percentage change for the fiscal year involved.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Adjustment for case mix creep</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments under subparagraph (G)(i) for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of residents that do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary may adjust unadjusted Federal per diem rates for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Determination of Federal rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute for each skilled nursing facility for each fiscal year (beginning with the initial period described in subparagraph (E)(i)) an adjusted Federal <!-- PDFPage:2415 -->per diem rate equal to the unadjusted Federal per diem rate determined under subparagraph (E), as adjusted under subparagraph (F), and as further adjusted as follows:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Adjustment for case mix</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate adjustment to account for case mix. Such adjustment shall be based on a resident classification system, established by the Secretary, that accounts for the relative resource utilization of different patient types. The case mix adjustment shall be based on resident assessment data and other data that the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjustment for geographic variations in labor costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall adjust the portion of such per diem rate attributable to wages and wage-related costs for the area in which the facility is located compared to the national average of such costs using an appropriate wage index as determined by the Secretary. Such adjustment shall be done in a manner that does not result in aggregate payments under this subsection that are greater or less than those that would otherwise be made if such adjustment had not been made.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustment for exclusion of certain additional items and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall provide for an appropriate proportional reduction in payments so that beginning with fiscal year 2001, the aggregate amount of such reductions is equal to the aggregate increase in payments attributable to the exclusion effected under clause (iii) of paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Publication of information on per diem rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall provide for publication in the Federal Register, before May 1, 1998 (with respect to fiscal period described in subparagraph (E)(i)) and before the August 1 preceding each succeeding fiscal year (with respect to that succeeding fiscal year), of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the unadjusted Federal per diem rates to be applied to days of covered skilled nursing facility services furnished during the fiscal year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the case mix classification system to be applied under subparagraph (G)(i) with respect to such services during the fiscal year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the factors to be applied in making the area wage adjustment under subparagraph (G)(ii) with respect to such services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Skilled nursing facility market basket index and percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Skilled nursing facility market basket index</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish a skilled nursing facility market basket index that reflects changes over time in the prices of an appropriate mix of goods and services included in covered skilled nursing facility services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Skilled nursing facility market basket percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;skilled nursing facility market basket percentage&rdquo; means, for a fiscal year or other annual period and as calculated by the Secretary, the percentage change in the skilled nursing facility market basket index (established under subparagraph (A)) from the midpoint of the prior fiscal year (or period) to the midpoint of the fiscal year (or other period) involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Submission of resident assessment data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A skilled nursing facility, or a facility described in paragraph (7)(B), shall provide the Secretary, in a manner and within the timeframes prescribed by the Secretary, the resident assessment data necessary to develop and implement the rates under this subsection. For purposes of meeting such requirement, a skilled nursing facility, or a facility described in paragraph (7), may submit the resident assessment data required under section 1395i&ndash;3(b)(3) of this title, using the standard instrument designated by the State under section 1395i&ndash;3(e)(5) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Treatment of medicare swing bed hospitals</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Transition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall determine an appropriate manner in which to apply this subsection to the facilities described in subparagraph (B) (other than critical access hospitals), taking into account the purposes of this subsection, and shall provide that at the end of the transition period (as defined in paragraph (2)(E)) such facilities shall be paid only under this subsection. Payment shall not be made under this subsection to such facilities for cost reporting periods beginning before such date (not earlier than July 1, 1999) as the Secretary specifies.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Facilities described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The facilities described in this subparagraph are facilities that have in effect an agreement described in section 1395tt of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exemption from PPS of swing-bed services furnished in critical access hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The prospective payment system established under this subsection shall not apply to services furnished by a critical access hospital pursuant to an agreement under section 1395tt of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Limitation on review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title, 1395<em>oo</em> of this title, or otherwise of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the establishment of Federal per diem rates under paragraph (4), including the computation of the standardized per diem rates under paragraph (4)(C), adjustments and corrections for case mix under paragraphs (4)(F) and (4)(G)(i), adjustments for variations in labor-related costs under para<!-- PDFPage:2416 -->graph (4)(G)(ii), and adjustments under paragraph (4)(G)(iii);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of facility specific rates before July 1, 1999 (except any determination of costs paid under part A of this subchapter); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the establishment of transitional amounts under paragraph (7).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Payment for certain services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an item or service furnished to a resident of a skilled nursing facility or a part of a facility that includes a skilled nursing facility (as determined under regulations) for which payment would (but for this paragraph) be made under part B of this subchapter in an amount determined in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(2)(B) of this title, the amount of the payment under such part shall be the amount provided under the fee schedule for such item or service. In the case of an item or service described in clause (iii) of paragraph (2)(A) that would be payable under part A of this subchapter but for the exclusion of such item or service under such clause, payment shall be made for the item or service, in an amount otherwise determined under part B of this subchapter for such item or service, from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund under section 1395i of this title (rather than from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund under section 1395t of this title).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Required coding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No payment may be made under part B of this subchapter for items and services (other than services described in paragraph (2)(A)(ii)) furnished to an individual who is a resident of a skilled nursing facility or of a part of a facility that includes a skilled nursing facility (as determined under regulations), unless the claim for such payment includes a code (or codes) under a uniform coding system specified by the Secretary that identifies the items or services furnished.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(11) Permitting facilities to waive 3-year transition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(A), a facility may elect to have the amount of the payment for all costs of covered skilled nursing facility services for each day of such services furnished in cost reporting periods beginning no earlier than 30 days before the date of such election determined pursuant to paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(12) Payment rule for certain facilities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<!-- PDFPage:2422 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Surveys of home health agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any agreement entered into or renewed by the Secretary pursuant to section 1395aa of this title relating to home health agencies shall provide that the appropriate State or local agency shall conduct, without any prior notice, a standard survey of each home health agency. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a home health agency of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this paragraph in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title. The Secretary shall review each State's or local agency's procedures for scheduling and conduct of standard surveys to assure that the State or agency has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), each home health agency shall be subject to a standard survey not later than 36 months after the date of the previous standard survey conducted under this paragraph. The Secretary shall establish a frequency for surveys of home health agencies within this 36-month interval commensurate with the need to assure the delivery of quality home health services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If not otherwise conducted under subparagraph (A), a standard survey (or an abbreviated standard survey) of an agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, or management of the agency to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care furnished by the agency, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall be conducted within 2 months of when a significant number of complaints have been reported with respect to the agency to the Secretary, the State, the entity responsible for the licensing of the agency, the State or local agency responsible for maintaining a toll-free hotline and investigative unit (under section 1395aa(a) of this title), or any other appropriate Federal, State, or local agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A standard survey conducted under this paragraph with respect to a home health agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall include (to the extent practicable), for a case-mix stratified sample of individuals furnished items or services by the agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) visits to the homes of such individuals, but only with the consent of such individuals, for the purpose of evaluating (in accordance with a standardized reproducible assessment instrument (or instruments) approved by the Secretary under subsection (d) of this section) the extent to which the quality and scope of items and services furnished by the agency attained and maintained the highest practicable functional capacity of each such individual as reflected in such individual's written plan of care required under section 1395x(m) of this title and clinical records required under section 1395x(<em>o</em>)(3) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) a survey of the quality of care and services furnished by the agency as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall be based upon a protocol that is developed, tested, and validated by the Secretary not later than January 1, 1989; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall be conducted by an individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) who meets minimum qualifications established by the Secretary not later than July 1, 1989,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) who is not serving (or has not served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the home health agency surveyed respecting compliance with the conditions of participation specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title or subsection (a) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) who has no personal or familial financial interest in the home health agency surveyed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Each home health agency that is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard care shall be subject to an extended survey to review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard care and to determine whether the agency has complied with the conditions of participation specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title or subsection (a) of this section. Any other agency may, at the Secretary's or State's discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey). The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practical, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring an extended (or partial extended) survey as a prerequisite to imposing a sanction against an agency under subsection (e) of this section on the basis of the findings of a standard survey.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assessment process; reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than January 1, 1989, the Secretary shall designate an assessment instrument (or instruments) for use by an agency in complying with subsection (c)(2)(C)(I)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395bbb_1_target" name="1395bbb_1">1</a></sup> of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than January 1, 1992, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) evaluate the assessment process,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) report to Congress on the results of such evaluation, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) based on such evaluation, make such modifications in the assessment process as the Secretary determines are appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall periodically update the evaluation conducted under subparagraph (A), report the results of such update to Congress, and, based on such update, make such modifications in the assessment process as the Secretary determines are appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall provide for the comprehensive training of State and Federal surveyors in matters relating to the performance of standard and extended surveys under this section, in<!-- PDFPage:2423 -->cluding the use of any assessment instrument (or instruments) designated under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary determines on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey or otherwise, that a home health agency that is certified for participation under this subchapter is no longer in compliance with the requirements specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title or subsection (a) of this section and determines that the deficiencies involved immediately jeopardize the health and safety of the individuals to whom the agency furnishes items and services, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in subsection (f)(2)(A)(iii) of this section or terminate the certification of the agency, and may provide, in addition, for 1 or more of the other remedies described in subsection (f)(2)(A) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey or otherwise, that a home health agency that is certified for participation under this subchapter is no longer in compliance with the requirements specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title or subsection (a) of this section and determines that the deficiencies involved do not immediately jeopardize the health and safety of the individuals to whom the agency furnishes items and services, the Secretary may (for a period not to exceed 6 months) impose intermediate sanctions developed pursuant to subsection (f) of this section, in lieu of terminating the certification of the agency. If, after such a period of intermediate sanctions, the agency is still no longer in compliance with the requirements specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title or subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall terminate the certification of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines that a home health agency that is certified for participation under this subchapter is in compliance with the requirements specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title or subsection (a) of this section but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subsection (f)(2)(A)(i) of this section for the days in which it finds that the agency was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may continue payments under this subchapter with respect to a home health agency not in compliance with the requirements specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title or subsection (a) of this section over a period of not longer than 6 months, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State or local survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the agency with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the agency,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the agency has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the agency agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this subparagraph if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) appropriate procedures for appealing determinations relating to the imposition of such sanctions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The intermediate sanctions developed under paragraph (1) shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) suspension of all or part of the payments to which a home health agency would otherwise be entitled under this subchapter with respect to items and services furnished by a home health agency on or after the date on which the Secretary determines that intermediate sanctions should be imposed pursuant to subsection (e)(2) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the appointment of temporary management to oversee the operation of the home health agency and to protect and assure the health and safety of the individuals under the care of the agency while improvements are made in order to bring the agency into compliance with all the requirements specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title or subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under clause (i) in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title. The temporary management under clause (iii) shall not be terminated until the Secretary has determined that the agency has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements referred to in that clause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The sanctions specified in subparagraph (A) are in addition to sanctions otherwise available under State or Federal law and shall not be construed as limiting other remedies, including any remedy available to an individual at common law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A finding to suspend payment under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall terminate when the Secretary finds that the home health agency is in substantial compliance with all the requirements specified in or pursuant to section 1395x(<em>o</em>) of this title and subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall develop and implement, by not later than April 1, 1989, specific procedures with respect to the conditions under which each of the intermediate sanctions developed under paragraph (1) is to be applied, including the amount of any fines and the severity of each of these sanctions. Such procedures shall be designed so as to minimize the time between <!-- PDFPage:2424 -->identification of deficiencies and imposition of these sanctions and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payment on basis of location of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A home health agency shall submit claims for payment for home health services under this subchapter only on the basis of the geographic location at which the service is furnished, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) deductions shall be made from the amounts otherwise payable to the individual under this subchapter, in accordance with a formula and schedule agreed to by the Secretary and the individual, until such past-due obligation (and accrued interest) have been repaid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) payment under this subchapter for services provided by such individual shall be made only on an assignment-related basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if the individual does not provide services, for which payment would otherwise be made under this subchapter, of a sufficient quantity to maintain the offset collection according to the agreed upon formula and schedule&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Past-due obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a past-due obligation is any amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) owed by an individual to the United States by reason of a breach of a scholarship contract under section 338E of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 254<em>o</em>] or under subpart III of part F of title VII of such Act (as in effect before October 1, 1976) and which has not been paid by the deadline established by the Secretary pursuant to such respective section, and has not been canceled, waived, or suspended by the Secretary pursuant to such section; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Collection under this section shall not be exclusive</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not preclude the United States from applying other provisions of law otherwise applicable to the collection of obligations owed to the United States, including (but not limited to) the use of tax refund offsets pursuant to section 3720A of title 31 and the application of other procedures provided under chapter 37 of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Collection from providers and health maintenance organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an individual who owes a past-due obligation, and who is an employee of, or affiliated by a medical services agreement with, a provider having an agreement under section 1395cc of this title or a health maintenance organization or competitive medical plan having a contract under section 1395<em>l</em> of this title or section 1395mm of this title, the Secretary shall deduct the amounts of such past-due obligation from amounts otherwise payable under this subchapter to such provider, organization, or plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Deductions shall be in accordance with a formula and schedule agreed to by the Secretary, the individual and the provider, organization, or plan. The deductions shall be made from the amounts otherwise payable to the individual under this subchapter as long as the individual continues to be employed or affiliated by a medical services agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such deduction shall not be made until 6 months after the Secretary notifies the provider, organization, or plan of the amount to be deducted and the particular physicians&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395ccc_3_target" name="1395ccc_3">3</a></sup> to whom the deductions are attributable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A deduction made under this subsection shall relieve the individual of the obligation (to the extent of the amount collected) to the United States, but the provider, organization, or plan shall have a right of action to collect from such individual the amount deducted pursuant to this subsection (including accumulated interest).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No deduction shall be made under this subsection if, within the 6-month period after notice is given to the provider, organization, or plan, the individual pays the past-due obligation, or ceases to be employed by the provider, organization, or plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Secretary shall also apply the provisions of this subsection in the case of an individual who is a member of a group practice, if such group practice submits bills under this program as a group, rather than by individual physicians.<sup><a href="#1395ccc_3_target" name="1395ccc_3">3</a></sup></p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transfer from trust funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts equal to the amounts deducted pursuant to this section shall be transferred from the Trust Fund from which the payment to the individual, provider, or other entity would otherwise have been made, to the general fund in the Treasury, and shall be credited as payment of the past-due obligation of the individual from whom (or with respect to whom) the deduction was made.</p>

Such amount under such an agreement shall be computed in a manner so that the total payment level for all PACE program eligible individuals enrolled under a program is less than the projected payment under this subchapter for a comparable population not enrolled under a PACE program.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1395fff. Prospective payment for home health services</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding section 1395x(v) of this title, the Secretary shall provide, for portions of cost reporting periods occurring on or after October 1, 2000, for payments for home health services in accordance with a prospective payment system established by the Secretary under this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2436 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) System of prospective payment for home health services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish under this subsection a prospective payment system for payment for all costs of home health services. Under the system under this subsection all services covered and paid on a reasonable cost basis under the medicare home health benefit as of August 5, 1997, including medical supplies, shall be paid for on the basis of a prospective payment amount determined under this subsection and applicable to the services involved. In implementing the system, the Secretary may provide for a transition (of not longer than 4 years) during which a portion of such payment is based on agency-specific costs, but only if such transition does not result in aggregate payments under this subchapter that exceed the aggregate payments that would be made if such a transition did not occur.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Unit of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In defining a prospective payment amount under the system under this subsection, the Secretary shall consider an appropriate unit of service and the number, type, and duration of visits provided within that unit, potential changes in the mix of services provided within that unit and their cost, and a general system design that provides for continued access to quality services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment basis</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Initial basis</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Under such system the Secretary shall provide for computation of a standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Such amount (or amounts) shall initially be based on the most current audited cost report data available to the Secretary and shall be computed in a manner so that the total amounts payable under the system for the 12-month period beginning on the date the Secretary implements the system shall be equal to the total amount that would have been made if the system had not been in effect and if section 1395x(v)(1)(L)(ix) of this title had not been enacted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) For the 12-month period beginning after the period described in subclause (I), such amount (or amounts) shall be equal to the amount (or amounts) determined under subclause (I), updated under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) For periods beginning after the period described in subclause (II), such amount (or amounts) shall be equal to the amount (or amounts) that would have been determined under subclause (I) that would have been made for fiscal year 2001 if the system had not been in effect and if section 1395x(v)(1)(L)(ix) of this title had not been enacted but if the reduction in limits described in clause (ii) had been in effect, updated under subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Each such amount shall be standardized in a manner that eliminates the effect of variations in relative case mix and area wage adjustments among different home health agencies in a budget neutral manner consistent with the case mix and wage level adjustments provided under paragraph (4)(A). Under the system, the Secretary may recognize regional differences or differences based upon whether or not the services or agency are in an urbanized area.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The reduction described in this clause is a reduction by 15 percent in the cost limits and per beneficiary limits described in section 1395x(v)(1)(L) of this title, as those limits are in effect on September 30, 2000.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Annual update</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) shall be adjusted for each fiscal year (beginning with fiscal year 2002) in a prospective manner specified by the Secretary by the home health applicable increase percentage (as defined in clause (ii)) applicable to the fiscal year involved.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Home health applicable increase percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;home health applicable increase percentage&rdquo; means, with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) each of fiscal years 2002 and 2003, the home health market basket percentage increase (as defined in clause (iii)) minus 1.1 percentage points; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any subsequent fiscal year, the home health market basket percentage increase.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Home health market basket percentage increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;home health market basket percentage increase&rdquo; means, with respect to a fiscal year, a percentage (estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the fiscal year) determined and applied with respect to the mix of goods and services included in home health services in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase under section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title is determined and applied to the mix of goods and services comprising inpatient hospital services for the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Adjustment for case mix changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments under paragraph (4)(A)(i) for a previous fiscal year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future fiscal year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the fiscal year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of different units of services that <!-- PDFPage:2437 -->do not reflect real changes in case mix, the Secretary may adjust the standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) under paragraph (3) for subsequent fiscal years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment for outliers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall reduce the standard prospective payment amount (or amounts) under this paragraph applicable to home health services furnished during a period by such proportion as will result in an aggregate reduction in payments for the period equal to the aggregate increase in payments resulting from the application of paragraph (5) (relating to outliers).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payment computation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The payment amount for a unit of home health services shall be the applicable standard prospective payment amount adjusted as follows:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Case mix adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount shall be adjusted by an appropriate case mix adjustment factor (established under subparagraph (B)).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Area wage adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The portion of such amount that the Secretary estimates to be attributable to wages and wage-related costs shall be adjusted for geographic differences in such costs by an area wage adjustment factor (established under subparagraph (C)) for the area in which the services are furnished or such other area as the Secretary may specify.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Establishment of case mix adjustment factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish appropriate case mix adjustment factors for home health services in a manner that explains a significant amount of the variation in cost among different units of services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Establishment of area wage adjustment factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish area wage adjustment factors that reflect the relative level of wages and wage-related costs applicable to the furnishing of home health services in a geographic area compared to the national average applicable level. Such factors may be the factors used by the Secretary for purposes of section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Outliers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may provide for an addition or adjustment to the payment amount otherwise made in the case of outliers because of unusual variations in the type or amount of medically necessary care. The total amount of the additional payments or payment adjustments made under this paragraph with respect to a fiscal year may not exceed 5 percent of the total payments projected or estimated to be made based on the prospective payment system under this subsection in that year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Proration of prospective payment amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a beneficiary elects to transfer to, or receive services from, another home health agency within the period covered by the prospective payment amount, the payment shall be prorated between the home health agencies involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for payment information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to home health services furnished on or after October 1, 1998, no claim for such a service may be paid under this subchapter unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the claim has the unique identifier (provided under section 1395u(r) of this title) for the physician who prescribed the services or made the certification described in section 1395f(a)(2) or 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of a service visit described in paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of section 1395x(m) of this title, the claim contains a code (or codes) specified by the Secretary that identifies the length of time of the service visit, as measured in 15 minute increments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be no administrative or judicial review under section 1395ff of this title, 1395<em>oo</em> of this title, or otherwise of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the establishment of a transition period under subsection (b)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the definition and application of payment units under subsection (b)(2) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the computation of initial standard prospective payment amounts under subsection (b)(3)(A) of this section (including the reduction described in clause (ii) of such subsection);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the establishment of the adjustment for outliers under subsection (b)(3)(C) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the establishment of case mix and area wage adjustments under subsection (b)(4) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the establishment of any adjustments for outliers under subsection (b)(5) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Construction related to home health services</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Telecommunications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a home health agency furnishing a home health unit of service for which payment is made under the prospective payment system established by this section for such units of service from furnishing services via a telecommunication system if such services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) do not substitute for in-person home health services ordered as part of a plan of care certified by a physician pursuant to section 1395f(a)(2)(C) or 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are not considered a home health visit for purposes of eligibility or payment under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Physician certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as waiving the requirement for a physician certification under section 1395f(a)(2)(C) or 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title for the payment for home health services, whether or not furnished via a telecommunications system.</p>
