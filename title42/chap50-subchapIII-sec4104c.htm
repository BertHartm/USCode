<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall carry out a program to provide financial assistance to States and communities, using amounts made available from the National Flood Mitigation Fund under section 4104d of this title, for planning and carrying out activities designed to reduce the risk of flood damage to structures covered under contracts for flood insurance under this chapter. Such financial assistance shall be made available to States and communities in the form of grants under subsection (b) of this section for planning assistance and in the form of grants under this section for carrying out mitigation activities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for mitigation assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to receive financial assistance under this section for mitigation activities, a State or community shall develop, and have approved by the Director, a flood risk mitigation plan (in this section referred to as a &ldquo;mitigation plan&rdquo;), that describes the mitigation activities to be carried out with assistance provided under this section, is consistent with the criteria established by the Director under section 4102 of this title, and provides protection against flood losses to structures for which contracts for flood insurance are available under this chapter.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use of amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts provided under this section (other than under subsection (b) of this section) may be used only for mitigation activities specified in a mitigation plan approved by the Director under subsection (d) of this section.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Standard for approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall approve mitigation plans meeting the requirements for approval under paragraph (1) that will be most cost-beneficial to the National Flood Mitigation Fund.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Priority for mitigation assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In providing grants under this subsection for mitigation activities, the Director shall give first priority for funding to such properties, or to such subsets of such properties as the Director may establish, that the Director determines are in the best interests of the National Flood Insurance Fund and for which matching amounts under subsection (f) of this section are available.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) acquisition by States and communities of properties (including public properties) located in areas having special flood hazards or other areas of flood risk and properties substantially damaged by flood, for public use, as the Director determines is consistent with sound land management and use in such area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) minor physical mitigation efforts that do not duplicate the flood prevention activities of other Federal agencies and that lessen the frequency or severity of flooding and decrease predicted flood damages, which shall not include major flood control projects such as dikes, levees, seawalls, groins, and jetties unless the Director specifically determines in approving a mitigation plan that such activities are the most cost-effective mitigation activities for the National Flood Mitigation Fund;</p>

Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.]) as a result of flood conditions is in effect with respect to areas in the State or community.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Matching requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director may not provide mitigation assistance under this section to a State or community in an amount exceeding 3 times the amount that the State or community certifies, as the Director shall require, that the State or community will contribute from non-Federal funds to develop a mitigation plan under subsection (c) of this section and to carry out mitigation activities under the approved mitigation plan. In no case shall any in-kind contribution by any State or community exceed one-half of the amount of non-Federal funds contributed by the State or community.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Director determines, after consultation with the State, that the State has taken actions to reduce the number of such properties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-Federal funds</h4>
