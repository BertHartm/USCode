<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard under this paragraph which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a covered product. The Secretary may not prescribe an amended standard under this subparagraph if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that a standard is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States in any product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some types (or classes) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a standard for other types or classes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A standard amended by the Secretary under this paragraph shall become effective for products manufactured&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, packaged terminal air conditioners, packaged terminal heat pumps, warm-air furnaces, packaged boilers, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and unfired hot water storage tanks, on or after a date which is two years after the effective date of the applicable minimum energy efficiency requirement in the amended ASHRAE/IES standard referred to in subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, on or after a date which is three years after the effective date of the applicable minimum energy efficiency requirement in the amended ASHRAE/IES standard referred to in subparagraph (A);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that an energy conservation standard amended by the Secretary pursuant to a rule under subparagraph (B) shall become effective for products manufactured on or after a date which is four years after the date such rule is published in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A labeling rule prescribed under this section shall take effect not later than 3 months after the date of prescription of such rule, except that such rules may take effect not later than 6 months after such date of prescription if the Secretary determines that such extension is necessary to allow persons subject to such rules adequate time to come into compliance with such rules.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Restrictions on Secretary's authority to promulgate rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not promulgate labeling rules for any class of industrial equipment unless he has determined that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) labeling in accordance with this section is technologically and economically feasible with respect to such class;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) significant energy savings will likely result from such labeling; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) labeling in accordance with this section is likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Tests for accuracy of information contained on labels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When requested by the Secretary, any manufacturer of industrial equipment to which a rule under this section applies shall supply at the manufacturer's expense a reasonable number of articles of such covered equipment to any laboratory or testing facility designated by the Secretary, or permit representatives of such laboratory or facility to test such equipment at the site where it is located, for purposes of ascertaining whether the information set out on the label, or otherwise required to be disclosed, as required under this section, is accurate. Any reasonable charge levied by the laboratory or facility for such testing shall be borne by the United States, if and to the extent provided in appropriations Acts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Products completed prior to effective date of rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A labeling rule under this section shall not apply to any article of covered equipment the manufacture of which was completed before the effective date of such rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Labeling authority under Federal Trade Commission Act</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until such time as labeling rules under this section take effect with respect to a type (or class) of covered equipment, this section shall not affect any authority of the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] to require labeling with respect to energy consumption of such type (or class) of covered equipment.</p>
