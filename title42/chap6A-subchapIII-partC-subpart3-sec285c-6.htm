The subcommittees are authorized to review applications made to the Director of the Institute for grants for research and training projects relating to the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of the diseases for which the subcommittees are established and shall recommend to the advisory council those applications and contracts that the subcommittees determine will best carry out the purposes of the Institute.
