<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the extent of involvement of residents, State and local governments, private service providers, financing entities, and developers, in the development and ongoing implementation of a revitalization program for the project, except that the Secretary may not award a grant under this section unless the applicant has involved affected public housing residents at the beginning and during the planning process for the revitalization program, prior to submission of an application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the need for affordable housing in the community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the supply of other housing available and affordable to families receiving tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the amount of funds and other resources to be leveraged by the grant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the extent of the need for, and the potential impact of, the revitalization program;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) the extent to which the plan sustains or creates more project-based housing units available to persons eligible for public housing in markets where the plan shows there is demand for the maintenance or creation of such units;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) the extent to which the plan gives to existing residents priority for occupancy in dwelling units which are public housing dwelling units, or for residents who can afford to live in other units, priority for those units in the revitalized community; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) such other factors as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Applicability of selection criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may determine not to apply certain of the selection criteria established <!-- PDFPage:3271 -->pursuant to paragraph (2) when awarding grants for demolition only, tenant-based assistance only, or other specific categories of revitalization activities. This section may not be construed to require any application for a grant under this section to include demolition of public housing or to preclude use of grant amounts for rehabilitation or rebuilding of any housing on an existing site.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Administration by other entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may require a grantee under this section to make arrangements satisfactory to the Secretary for use of an entity other than the public housing agency to carry out activities assisted under the revitalization plan, if the Secretary determines that such action will help to effectuate the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Withdrawal of funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a grantee under this section does not proceed within a reasonable timeframe, in the determination of the Secretary, the Secretary shall withdraw any grant amounts under this section that have not been obligated by the public housing agency. The Secretary shall redistribute any withdrawn amounts to one or more other applicants eligible for assistance under this section or to one or more other entities capable of proceeding expeditiously in the same locality in carrying out the revitalization plan of the original grantee.</p>
