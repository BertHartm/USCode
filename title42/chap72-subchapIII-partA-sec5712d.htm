<p class="note-body">Section 40155(2) of Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, which directed that this section be added after section 315 of Pub. L. 93&ndash;415, was executed by adding this section after section 312 of Pub. L. 93&ndash;415 (classified to section 5712 of this title) to reflect the probable intent of Congress and amendment by Pub. L. 102&ndash;586, &sect;3(g)(2)(A)&ndash;(D), which repealed sections 313 to 315 of Pub. L. 93&ndash;415 (formerly classified to sections 5712a to 5712c of this title) and renumbered sections 316 and 317 of Pub. L. 93&ndash;415 as sections 313 and 314, respectively, of Pub. L. 93&ndash;415 (classified to sections 5713 and 5714 of this title). Section 40155(1) of Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, which directed that sections 316 and 317 of Pub. L. 93&ndash;415 be renumbered sections 317 and 318 of Pub. L. 93&ndash;415, could not be executed because of the previous renumbering of sections 316 and 317 as sections 313 and 314 of Pub. L. 93&ndash;415, as indicated above.</p>
