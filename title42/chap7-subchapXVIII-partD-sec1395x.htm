<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, such term includes any institution which meets the requirements of paragraph (1) of this subsection. For purposes of sections 1395f(d) and 1395n(b) of this title (including determination of whether an individual received inpatient hospital services or diagnostic services for purposes of such sections), section 1395f(f)(2) of this title, and subsection (i) of this section, such term includes any institution which (i) meets the requirements of paragraphs (5) and (7) of this subsection, (ii) is not primarily engaged in providing the services described in subsection (j)(1)(A) of this section and (iii) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of individuals referred to in paragraph (1) of subsection (r) of this section, to inpatients diagnostic services and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment, and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons. For purposes of section 1395f(f)(1) of this title, such term includes an institution which (i) is a hospital for purposes of sections 1395f(d), 1395f(f)(2), and 1395n(b) of this title and (ii) is accredited by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals, or is accredited by or approved by a program of the country in which such institution is located if the Secretary finds the accreditation or comparable approval standards of such program to be essentially equivalent to those of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, such term shall not, except for purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, include any institution which is primarily for the care and treatment of mental diseases unless it is a psychiatric hospital (as defined in subsection (f) of this section). The term &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; also includes a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in subsection (ss)(1) of this section), but only with respect to items and services ordinarily furnished by such institution to inpatients, and payment may be made with respect to services provided by or in such an institution only to such extent and under such conditions, limitations, and requirements (in addition to or in lieu of the conditions, limitations, and requirements otherwise applicable) as may be provided in regulations consistent with section 1395i&ndash;5 of this title. For provisions deeming certain requirements of this subsection to be met in the case of accredited institutions, see section 1395bb of this title. The term &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; also includes a facility of fifty beds or less which is located in an area determined by the Secretary to meet the definition relating to a rural area described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (5) of this subsection and which meets the other requirements of this subsection, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) with respect to the requirements for nursing services applicable after December 31, 1978, such requirements shall provide for temporary waiver of the requirements, for such period as the Secretary deems appropriate, where (i) the facility's failure to fully comply with the requirements is attributable to a temporary shortage of qualified nursing personnel in the area in which the facility is located, (ii) a registered professional nurse is present on the premises to render or supervise the nursing service provided during at least the regular daytime shift, and (iii) the Secretary determines that the employment of such nursing personnel as are available to the facility during such temporary period will not adversely affect the health and safety of patients;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to the health and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), such requirements shall be applied by the Secretary to a facility herein defined in such manner as to assure that personnel requirements take into account the availability of technical personnel and the educational opportunities for technical personnel in the area in which such facility is located, and the scope of services rendered by such facility; and the Secretary, by regulations, shall provide for the continued participation of such a facility where such personnel requirements are not fully met, for such period as the Secretary determines that (i) the facility is making good faith efforts to fully comply with the personnel requirements, (ii) the employment by the facility of such personnel as are available to the facility will not adversely affect the health and safety of patients, and (iii) if the Secretary has determined that because of the facility's waiver under this subparagraph the facility should limit its scope of services in order not to adversely affect the health and safety of the facility's patients, the facility is so limiting the scope of services it provides; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) with respect to the fire and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), the Secretary (i) may waive, for such period as he deems appropriate, specific provisions of such requirements which if rigidly applied would result in unreasonable hardship for such <!-- PDFPage:1933 -->a facility and which, if not applied, would not jeopardize the health and safety of patients, and (ii) may accept a facility's compliance with all applicable State codes relating to fire and safety in lieu of compliance with the fire and safety requirements promulgated under paragraph (9), if he determines that such State has in effect fire and safety codes, imposed by State law, which adequately protect patients.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The term &ldquo;hospital&rdquo; does not include, unless the context otherwise requires, a critical access hospital (as defined in subsection (mm)(1) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Psychiatric hospital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;psychiatric hospital&rdquo; means an institution which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is primarily engaged in providing, by or under the supervision of a physician, psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill persons;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Outpatient occupational therapy services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;outpatient occupational therapy services&rdquo; has the meaning given the term &ldquo;outpatient physical therapy services&rdquo; in subsection (p) of this section, except that &ldquo;occupational&rdquo; shall be substituted for &ldquo;physical&rdquo; each place it appears therein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Extended care services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;extended care services&rdquo; means the following items and services furnished to an inpatient of a skilled nursing facility and (except as provided in paragraphs (3), (6), and (7)) by such skilled nursing facility&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such other services necessary to the health of the patients as are generally provided by skilled nursing facilities, or by others under arrangements with them made by the facility;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">excluding, however, any item or service if it would not be included under subsection (b) of this section if furnished to an inpatient of a hospital.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;post-hospital extended care services&rdquo; means extended care services furnished an individual after transfer from a hospital in which he was an inpatient for not less than 3 consecutive days before his discharge from the hospital in connection with such transfer. For purposes of the preceding sentence, items and services shall be deemed to have been furnished to an individual after transfer from a hospital, and he shall be deemed to have been an inpatient in the hospital immediately before transfer therefrom, if he is admitted to the skilled nursing facility (A) within 30 days after discharge from such hospital, or (B) within such time as it would be medically appropriate to begin an active course of treatment, in the case of an individual whose condition is such that skilled nursing facility care would not be medically appropriate within 30 days after discharge from a hospital; and an individual shall be deemed not to have been discharged from a skilled nursing facility if, within 30 days after discharge therefrom, he is admitted to such facility or any other skilled nursing facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Skilled nursing facility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;skilled nursing facility&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 1395i&ndash;3(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Utilization review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A utilization review plan of a hospital or skilled nursing facility shall be considered sufficient if it is applicable to services furnished by the institution to individuals entitled to insurance benefits under this subchapter and if it provides&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for the review, on a sample or other basis, of admissions to the institution, the duration of stays therein, and the professional services (including drugs and biologicals) furnished, (A) with respect to the medical necessity of the services, and (B) for the purpose of promoting the most efficient use of available health facilities and services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for such review to be made by either (A) a staff committee of the institution composed of two or more physicians (of which at least two must be physicians described in subsection (r)(1) of this section), with or without participation of other professional personnel, or (B) a group outside the institution which is similarly composed and (i) which is estab<!-- PDFPage:1934 -->lished by the local medical society and some or all of the hospitals and skilled nursing facilities in the locality, or (ii) if (and for as long as) there has not been established such a group which serves such institution, which is established in such other manner as may be approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for such review, in each case of inpatient hospital services or extended care services furnished to such an individual during a continuous period of extended duration, as of such days of such period (which may differ for different classes of cases) as may be specified in regulations, with such review to be made as promptly as possible, after each day so specified, and in no event later than one week following such day; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for prompt notification to the institution, the individual, and his attending physician of any finding (made after opportunity for consultation to such attending physician) by the physician members of such committee or group that any further stay in the institution is not medically necessary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The review committee must be composed as provided in clause (B) of paragraph (2) rather than as provided in clause (A) of such paragraph in the case of any hospital or skilled nursing facility where, because of the small size of the institution, or (in the case of a skilled nursing facility) because of lack of an organized medical staff, or for such other reason or reasons as may be included in regulations, it is impracticable for the institution to have a properly functioning staff committee for the purposes of this subsection. If the Secretary determines that the utilization review procedures established pursuant to subchapter XIX of this chapter are superior in their effectiveness to the procedures required under this section, he may, to the extent that he deems it appropriate, require for purposes of this subchapter that the procedures established pursuant to subchapter XIX of this chapter be utilized instead of the procedures required by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Agreements for transfer between skilled nursing facilities and hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A hospital and a skilled nursing facility shall be considered to have a transfer agreement in effect if, by reason of a written agreement between them or (in case the two institutions are under common control) by reason of a written undertaking by the person or body which controls them, there is reasonable assurance that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) transfer of patients will be effected between the hospital and the skilled nursing facility whenever such transfer is medically appropriate as determined by the attending physician; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there will be interchange of medical and other information necessary or useful in the care and treatment of individuals transferred between the institutions, or in determining whether such individuals can be adequately cared for otherwise than in either of such institutions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any skilled nursing facility which does not have such an agreement in effect, but which is found by a State agency (of the State in which such facility is situated) with which an agreement under section 1395aa of this title is in effect (or, in the case of a State in which no such agency has an agreement under section 1395aa of this title, by the Secretary) to have attempted in good faith to enter into such an agreement with a hospital sufficiently close to the facility to make feasible the transfer between them of patients and the information referred to in paragraph (2), shall be considered to have such an agreement in effect if and for so long as such agency (or the Secretary, as the case may be) finds that to do so is in the public interest and essential to assuring extended care services for persons in the community who are eligible for payments with respect to such services under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Home health services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;home health services&rdquo; means the following items and services furnished to an individual, who is under the care of a physician, by a home health agency or by others under arrangements with them made by such agency, under a plan (for furnishing such items and services to such individual) established and periodically reviewed by a physician, which items and services are, except as provided in paragraph (7), provided on a visiting basis in a place of residence used as such individual's home&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) medical supplies (including catheters, catheter supplies, ostomy bags, and supplies related to ostomy care, and a covered osteoporosis drug (as defined in subsection (kk) of this section), but excluding other drugs and biologicals) and durable medical equipment while under such a plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in the case of a home health agency which is affiliated or under common control with a hospital, medical services provided by an intern or resident-in-training of such hospital, under a teaching program of such hospital approved as provided in the last sentence of subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) any of the foregoing items and services which are provided on an outpatient basis, under arrangements made by the home health agency, at a hospital or skilled nursing facility, or at a rehabilitation center which meets such standards as may be prescribed in regulations, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the furnishing of which involves the use of equipment of such a nature that the items and services cannot readily be made available to the individual in such place of residence, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which are furnished at such facility while he is there to receive any such item or service described in clause (A),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1935 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but not including transportation of the individual in connection with any such item or service;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">excluding, however, any item or service if it would not be included under subsection (b) of this section if furnished to an inpatient of a hospital. For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (4), the term &ldquo;part-time or intermittent services&rdquo; means skilled nursing and home health aide services furnished any number of days per week as long as they are furnished (combined) less than 8 hours each day and 28 or fewer hours each week (or, subject to review on a case-by-case basis as to the need for care, less than 8 hours each day and 35 or fewer hours per week). For purposes of sections 1395f(a)(2)(C) and 1395n(a)(2)(A) of this title, &ldquo;intermittent&rdquo; means skilled nursing care that is either provided or needed on fewer than 7 days each week, or less than 8 hours of each day for periods of 21 days or less (with extensions in exceptional circumstances when the need for additional care is finite and predictable).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Durable medical equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;durable medical equipment&rdquo; includes iron lungs, oxygen tents, hospital beds, and wheelchairs (which may include a power-operated vehicle that may be appropriately used as a wheelchair, but only where the use of such a vehicle is determined to be necessary on the basis of the individual's medical and physical condition and the vehicle meets such safety requirements as the Secretary may prescribe) used in the patient's home (including an institution used as his home other than an institution that meets the requirements of subsection (e)(1) of this section or section 1395i&ndash;3(a)(1) of this title), whether furnished on a rental basis or purchased, and includes blood-testing strips and blood glucose monitors for individuals with diabetes without regard to whether the individual has Type I or Type II diabetes or to the individual's use of insulin (as determined under standards established by the Secretary in consultation with the appropriate organizations); except that such term does not include such equipment furnished by a supplier who has used, for the demonstration and use of specific equipment, an individual who has not met such minimum training standards as the Secretary may establish with respect to the demonstration and use of such specific equipment.

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The reasonable cost of any services shall be the cost actually incurred, excluding therefrom any part of incurred cost found to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services, and shall be determined in accordance with regulations establishing the method or methods to be used, and the items to be included, in determining such costs for various types or classes of institutions, agencies, and services; except that in any case to which paragraph (2) or (3) applies, the amount of the payment determined under such paragraph with respect to the services involved shall be considered the reasonable cost of such services. In prescribing the regulations referred to in the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall consider, among other things, the principles generally applied by national organizations or established prepayment organizations (which have developed such principles) in computing the amount of payment, to be made by persons other than the recipients of services, to providers of services on account of services furnished to such recipients by such providers. Such regulations may provide for determination of the costs of services on a per diem, per unit, per capita, or other basis, may provide for using different methods in different circumstances, may provide for the use of estimates of costs of particular items or services, may provide for the establishment of limits on the direct or indirect overall incurred costs or incurred costs of specific items or services or groups of items or services to be recognized as reasonable based on estimates of the costs necessary in the efficient delivery of needed health services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established under this subchapter, and may provide for the use of charges or a percentage of charges where this method reasonably reflects the costs. Such regulations shall (i) take into account both direct and indirect costs of providers of services (excluding therefrom any such costs, including standby costs, which are determined in accordance with regulations to be unnecessary in the efficient delivery of services covered by the insurance programs established under this subchapter) in order that, under the methods of determining costs, the necessary costs of efficiently delivering covered services to individuals covered by the insurance programs established by this subchapter will not be borne by individuals not so covered, and the costs with respect to individuals not so covered will not be borne by such insurance programs, and (ii) provide for the making of suitable retroactive corrective adjustments where, for a provider of services for any fiscal period, the aggregate reimbursement produced by the methods of determining costs proves to be either inadequate or excessive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of extended care services, the regulations under subparagraph (A) shall not include provision for specific recognition of a return on equity capital.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) Such regulations may, in the case of skilled nursing facilities in any State, provide for the use of rates, developed by the State in which such facilities are located, for the payment of the cost of skilled nursing facility services furnished under the State's plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter (and such rates may be increased by the Secretary on a class or size of institution or on a geographical basis by a percentage factor not in excess of 10 percent to take into account determinable items or services or other requirements under this subchapter not otherwise included in the computation of such State rates), if the Secretary finds that such rates are reasonably related to (but not necessarily limited to) analyses undertaken by such State of costs of care in comparable facilities in such State. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, such regulations with respect to skilled nursing facilities shall take into account (in a manner consistent with subparagraph (A) and based on patient-days of services furnished) the costs (including the costs of services required to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident eligible for benefits under this subchapter) of such facilities complying with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of section 1395i&ndash;3 of this title (including the costs of conducting nurse aide training and competency evaluation programs and competency evaluation programs).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In any case in which a hospital provides inpatient services to an individual that would constitute post-hospital extended care services if provided by a skilled nursing facility and a quality control and peer review organization (or, in the absence of such a qualified organization, the Secretary or such agent as the Secretary may designate) determines that inpatient hospital services for the individual are not medically necessary but post-hospital extended care services for the individual are medically necessary and such extended care services are not otherwise available to the individual (as determined in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary) at the time of such determination, payment for such services provided to the individual shall continue to be made under this subchapter at the payment rate described in clause (ii) during the period in which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Any day on which an individual receives inpatient services for which payment is made under this subparagraph shall, for purposes of this chapter (other than this subparagraph), be deemed to be a day on which the individual received inpatient hospital services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In determining under clause (i), in the case of a public hospital, whether or not there is an excess of hospital beds in the area of such hospital, such determination shall be made on the basis of only the public hospitals (including the hospital) which are in the area of the hospital and which are under common ownership with that hospital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H) In determining such reasonable cost with respect to home health agencies, the Secretary may not include&mdash;</p>
