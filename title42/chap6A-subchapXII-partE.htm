<p class="statutory-body">If any person who uses chlorine, activated carbon, lime, ammonia, soda ash, potassium permanganate, caustic soda, or other chemical or substance for the purpose of treating water in any public water system or in any public treatment works determines that the amount of such chemical or substance necessary to effectively treat such water is not reasonably available to him or will not be so available to him when required for the effective treatment of such water, such person may apply to the Administrator for a certification (hereinafter in this section referred to as a &ldquo;certification of need&rdquo;) that the amount of such chemical or substance which such person requires to effectively treat such water is not reasonably available to him or will not be so available when required for the effective treatment of such water.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Application requirements; publication in Federal Register; waiver; certification, issuance or denial</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An application for a certification of need shall be in such form and submitted in such manner as the Administrator may require and shall (A) specify the persons the applicant determines are able to provide the chemical or substance with respect to which the application is submitted, (B) specify the persons from whom the applicant has sought such chemical or substance, and (C) contain such other information as the Administrator may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon receipt of an application under this section, the Administrator shall (A) publish in the Federal Register a notice of the receipt of the application and a brief summary of it, (B) notify in writing each person whom the President or his delegate (after consultation with the Administrator) determines could be made subject to an order required to be issued upon the issuance of the certification of need applied for in such application, and (C) provide an opportunity for the submission of written comments on such application. The requirements of the <!-- PDFPage:680 -->preceding sentence of this paragraph shall not apply when the Administrator for good cause finds (and incorporates the finding with a brief statement of reasons therefor in the order issued) that waiver of such requirements is necessary in order to protect the public health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 30 days after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date a notice is published under paragraph (2) in the Federal Register with respect to an application submitted under this section for the issuance of a certification of need, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date on which such application is received if as authorized by the second sentence of such paragraph no notice is published with respect to such application,</p>

Not later than seven days following the issuance of such certification, the President or his delegate shall issue an order requiring the provision to such person of such amounts of such chemical or substance as the Administrator deems necessary in the certification of need issued for such person. Such order shall apply to such manufactures, producers, processors, distributors, and repackagers of such chemical or substance as the President or his delegate deems necessary and appropriate, except that such order may not apply to any manufacturer, producer, or processor of such chemical or substance who manufactures, produces, or processes (as the case may be) such chemical or substance solely for its own use. Persons subject to an order issued under this section shall be given a reasonable opportunity to consult with the President or his delegate with respect to the implementation of the order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Orders which are to be issued under paragraph (1) to manufacturers, producers, and processors of a chemical or substance shall be equitably apportioned, as far as practicable, among all manufacturers, producers, and processors of such chemical or substance; and orders which are to be issued under paragraph (1) to distributors and repackagers of a chemical or substance shall be equitably apportioned, as far as practicable, among all distributors and repackagers of such chemical or substance. In apportioning orders issued under paragraph (1) to manufacturers, producers, processors, distributors, and repackagers of chlorine, the President or his delegate shall, in carrying out the requirements of the preceding sentence, consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the geographical relationships and established commercial relationships between such manufacturers, producers, processors, distributors, and repackagers and the persons for whom the orders are issued;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of orders to be issued to producers of chlorine, the (i) amount of chlorine historically supplied by each such producer to treat water in public water systems and public treatment works, and (ii) share of each such producer of the total annual production of chlorine in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such other factors as the President or his delegate may determine are relevant to the apportionment of orders in accordance with the requirements of the preceding sentence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to subsection (f) of this section, any person for whom a certification of need has been issued under this subsection may upon the expiration of the order issued under paragraph (1) upon such certification apply under this section for additional certifications.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Breach of contracts; defense</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be available as a defense to any action brought for breach of contract in a Federal or State court arising out of delay or failure to provide, sell, or offer for sale or exchange a chemical or substance subject to an order issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, that such delay or failure was caused solely by compliance with such order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Penalties for noncompliance with orders; temporary restraining orders and preliminary or permanent injunctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whoever knowingly fails to comply with any order issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section shall be fined not more than $5,000 for each such failure to comply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whoever fails to comply with any order issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $2,500 for each such failure to comply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever the Administrator or the President or his delegate has reason to believe that any person is violating or will violate any order issued pursuant to subsection (c)(1) of this section, he may petition a United States district court to issue a temporary restraining order or preliminary or permanent injunction (including a mandatory injunction) to enforce the provision of such order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination date</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Public water systems supervision programs; applications for grants; allotment of sums; waiver of grant restrictions; notice of approval or disapproval of application; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From allotments made pursuant to paragraph (4), the Administrator may make grants to States to carry out public water system supervision programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No grant may be made under paragraph (1) unless an application therefor has been submitted to the Administrator in such form and manner as he may require. The Administrator may not approve an application of a State for its first grant under paragraph (1) unless he determines that the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has established or will establish within one year from the date of such grant a public water system supervision program, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will, within that one year, assume primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No grant may be made to a State under paragraph (1) for any period beginning more than one year after the date of the State's first grant unless the State has assumed and maintains primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State. The prohibitions contained in the preceding two sentences shall not apply to such grants when made to Indian Tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A grant under paragraph (1) shall be made to cover not more than 75 per centum of the grant recipient's costs (as determined under regulations of the Administrator) in carrying out, during the one-year period beginning on the date the grant is made, a public water system supervision program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In each fiscal year the Administrator shall, in accordance, with regulations, allot the sums appropriated for such year under paragraph (5) among the States on the basis of population, geographical area, number of public water systems, and other relevant factors. No State shall receive less than 1 per centum of the annual appropriation for grants under paragraph (1): <em>Provided</em>, That the Administrator may, by regulation, reduce such percentage in accordance with the criteria specified in this paragraph: <em>And provided further</em>, That such percentage shall not apply to grants allotted to Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The prohibition contained in the last sentence of paragraph (2) may be waived by the Administrator with respect to a grant to a State through fiscal year 1979 but such prohibition may only be waived if, in the judgment of the Administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State is making a diligent effort to assume and maintain primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State has made significant progress toward assuming and maintaining such primary enforcement responsibility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there is reason to believe the State will assume such primary enforcement responsibility by October 1, 1979.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of any grant awarded for the fiscal years 1978 and 1979 pursuant to a waiver under this paragraph may not exceed 75 per centum of the allotment which the State would have received for such fiscal year if it had assumed and maintained such primary enforcement responsibility. The remaining 25 per centum of the amount allotted to such State for such fiscal year shall be retained by the Administrator, and the Administrator may award such amount to such State at such time as the State assumes such responsibility before the beginning of fiscal year 1980. At the beginning of each fiscal years 1979 and 1980 the amounts retained by the Administrator for any preceding fiscal year and not awarded by the beginning of fiscal year 1979 or 1980 to the States to which such amounts were originally allotted may be removed from the original allotment and reallotted for fiscal year 1979 or 1980 (as the case may be) to States which have assumed primary enforcement responsibility by the beginning of such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Administrator shall notify the State of the approval or disapproval of any application for a grant under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within ninety days after receipt of such application, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not later than the first day of the fiscal year for which the grant application is made,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purpose of making grants under paragraph (1), there are authorized to be appropriated $100,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1997 through 2003.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) <cap-smallcap>Reservation of funds by the administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator assumes the primary enforcement responsibility of a State public water system supervision program, the Administrator may reserve from funds made available pursuant to this subsection an amount equal to the amount that would otherwise have been provided to the State pursuant to this sub<!-- PDFPage:685 -->section. The Administrator shall use the funds reserved pursuant to this paragraph to ensure the full and effective administration of a public water system supervision program in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) <cap-smallcap>State loan funds.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Reservation of funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any fiscal year for which the amount made available to the Administrator by appropriations to carry out this subsection is less than the amount that the Administrator determines is necessary to supplement funds made available pursuant to paragraph (8) to ensure the full and effective administration of a public water system supervision program in a State, the Administrator may reserve from the funds made available to the State under section 300j&ndash;12 of this title (relating to State loan funds) an amount that is equal to the amount of the shortfall. This paragraph shall not apply to any State not exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems as of August 6, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Duty of administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator reserves funds from the allocation of a State under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall carry out in the State each of the activities that would be required of the State if the State had primary enforcement authority under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Underground water source protection programs; applications for grants; allotment of sums; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From allotments made pursuant to paragraph (4), the Administrator may make grants to States to carry out underground water source protection programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No grant may be made under paragraph (1) unless an application therefor has been submitted to the Administrator in such form and manner as he may require. No grant may be made to any State under paragraph (1) unless the State has assumed primary enforcement responsibility within two years after the date the Administrator promulgates regulations for State underground injection control programs under section 300h of this title. The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall not apply to such grants when made to Indian Tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A grant under paragraph (1) shall be made to cover not more than 75 per centum of the grant recipient's cost (as determined under regulations of the Administrator) in carrying out, during the one-year period beginning on the date the grant is made, and underground water source protection program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In each fiscal year the Administrator shall, in accordance with regulations, allot the sums appropriated for such year under paragraph (5) among the States on the basis of population, geographical area, and other relevant factors.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any such petition shall be filed within the 45-day period beginning on the date of the promulgation of the regulation or any other final Agency action with respect to which review is sought or on the date of the determination with respect to which review is sought, and may be filed after the expiration of such 45-day period if the petition is based solely on grounds arising after the expiration of such period. Action of the Administrator with respect to which review could have been obtained under this subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement or in any civil action to enjoin enforcement. In any petition concerning the assessment of a civil penalty pursuant to section 300g&ndash;3(g)(3)(B) of this title, the petitioner shall simultaneously send a copy of the complaint by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General. The court shall set aside and remand the penalty order if the court finds that there is not substantial evidence in the record to support the finding of a violation or that the assessment of the penalty by the Administrator constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>

Such an action may only be brought upon a petition for review filed with the court within the 45-day period beginning on the date the action sought to be reviewed is taken or, in the case of a petition to review the refusal to grant a variance or exemption or the failure to prescribe a schedule, within the 45-day period beginning on the date action is required to be taken on the variance, exemption, or schedule, as the case may be. A petition for such review may be filed after the expiration of such period if the petition is based solely on grounds arising after the expiration of such period. Action with respect to which review could have been obtained under this subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement or in any civil action to enjoin enforcement.</p>

The Administrator may modify his findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he shall file such modified or new findings, and his recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of his original determination, with the return of such additional evidence.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grants to States to establish State loan funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall offer to enter into agreements with eligible States to make capitalization grants, including letters of credit, to the States under this subsection to further the health protection objectives of this subchapter, promote the efficient use of fund resources, and for other purposes as are specified in this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Establishment of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To be eligible to receive a capitalization grant under this section, a State shall establish a drinking water treatment revolving loan fund (referred to in this section as a &ldquo;State loan fund&rdquo;) and comply with the other requirements of this section. Each grant to a State under this section shall be deposited in the State loan fund established by the State, except as otherwise provided in this section and in other provisions of this subchapter. No funds authorized by other provisions of this subchapter to be used for other purposes specified in this subchapter shall be deposited in any State loan fund.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Extended period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The grant to a State shall be available to the State for obligation during the fiscal year for which the funds are authorized and during the following fiscal year, except that grants made available from funds provided prior to fiscal year 1997 shall be available for obligation during each of the fiscal years 1997 and 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Allotment formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, funds made available to carry out this section shall be allotted to States that have entered into an agreement pursuant to this section (other than the District of Columbia) in accordance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for each of fiscal years 1995 through 1997, a formula that is the same as the formula used to distribute public water system supervision grant funds under section 300j&ndash;2 of this title in fiscal year 1995, except that the minimum proportionate share established in the formula shall be 1 percent of available funds and the formula shall be adjusted to include a minimum proportionate share for the State of Wyoming and the District of Columbia; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for fiscal year 1998 and each subsequent fiscal year, a formula that allocates to each State the proportional share of the State needs identified in the most recent survey conducted pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, except that the minimum proportionate share provided to each State shall be the same as the minimum proportionate share provided under clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The grants not obligated by the last day of the period for which the grants are available shall be reallotted according to the appropriate criteria set forth in subparagraph (D), except that the Administrator may reserve and allocate 10 percent of the remaining amount for financial assistance to Indian Tribes in addition to the amount allotted under subsection (i) of this section and none of the funds reallotted by the Administrator shall be reallotted to any State that has not obligated all sums allotted to the State pursuant to this section during the period in which the sums were available for obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Nonprimacy States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State allotment for a State not exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems shall not be deposited in any such fund but shall be allotted by the Administrator under this subparagraph. Pursuant to section 300j&ndash;2(a)(9)(A) of this title such sums allotted under this subparagraph shall be reserved as needed by the Administrator to exercise primary enforcement responsibility under this subchapter in such State and the remainder shall be reallotted to States exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems for deposit in such funds. Whenever the Administrator makes a final determination pursuant to section 300g&ndash;2(b) of this title that the requirements of section 300g&ndash;2(a) of this title are no longer being met by a State, additional grants for such State under this sub<!-- PDFPage:700 -->chapter shall be immediately terminated by the Administrator. This subparagraph shall not apply to any State not exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems as of August 6, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Other programs</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) New system capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Beginning in fiscal year 1999, the Administrator shall withhold 20 percent of each capitalization grant made pursuant to this section to a State unless the State has met the requirements of section 300g&ndash;9(a) of this title (relating to capacity development) and shall withhold 10 percent for fiscal year 2001, 15 percent for fiscal year 2002, and 20 percent for fiscal year 2003 if the State has not complied with the provisions of section 300g&ndash;9(c) of this title (relating to capacity development strategies). Not more than a total of 20 percent of the capitalization grants made to a State in any fiscal year may be withheld under the preceding provisions of this clause. All funds withheld by the Administrator pursuant to this clause shall be reallotted by the Administrator on the basis of the same ratio as is applicable to funds allotted under subparagraph (D). None of the funds reallotted by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph shall be allotted to a State unless the State has met the requirements of section 300g&ndash;9 of this title (relating to capacity development).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Operator certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Administrator shall withhold 20 percent of each capitalization grant made pursuant to this section unless the State has met the requirements of 300g&ndash;8&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300j-12_1_target" name="300j-12_1">1</a></sup> of this title (relating to operator certification). All funds withheld by the Administrator pursuant to this clause shall be reallotted by the Administrator on the basis of the same ratio as applicable to funds allotted under subparagraph (D). None of the funds reallotted by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph shall be allotted to a State unless the State has met the requirements of section 300g&ndash;8 of this title (relating to operator certification).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise authorized by this subchapter, amounts deposited in a State loan fund, including loan repayments and interest earned on such amounts, shall be used only for providing loans or loan guarantees, or as a source of reserve and security for leveraged loans, the proceeds of which are deposited in a State loan fund established under paragraph (1), or other financial assistance authorized under this section to community water systems and nonprofit noncommunity water systems, other than systems owned by Federal agencies. Financial assistance under this section may be used by a public water system only for expenditures (not including monitoring, operation, and maintenance expenditures) of a type or category which the Administrator has determined, through guidance, will facilitate compliance with national primary drinking water regulations applicable to the system under section 300g&ndash;1 of this title or otherwise significantly further the health protection objectives of this subchapter. The funds may also be used to provide loans to a system referred to in section 300f(4)(B) of this title for the purpose of providing the treatment described in section 300f(4)(B)(i)(III) of this title. The funds shall not be used for the acquisition of real property or interests therein, unless the acquisition is integral to a project authorized by this paragraph and the purchase is from a willing seller. Of the amount credited to any State loan fund established under this section in any fiscal year, 15 percent shall be available solely for providing loan assistance to public water systems which regularly serve fewer than 10,000 persons to the extent such funds can be obligated for eligible projects of public water systems.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no assistance under this section shall be provided to a public water system that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not have the technical, managerial, and financial capability to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is in significant noncompliance with any requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation or variance.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Restructuring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A public water system described in subparagraph (A) may receive assistance under this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the use of the assistance will ensure compliance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if subparagraph (A)(i) applies to the system, the owner or operator of the system agrees to undertake feasible and appropriate changes in operations (including ownership, management, accounting, rates, maintenance, consolidation, alternative water supply, or other procedures) if the State determines that the measures are necessary to ensure that the system has the technical, managerial, and financial capability to comply with the requirements of this subchapter over the long term.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Prior to providing assistance under this section to a public water system that is in significant noncompliance with any requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation or variance, the State shall conduct a review to determine whether subparagraph (A)(i) applies to the system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Intended use plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After providing for public review and comment, each State that has entered into a capitalization agreement pursuant to this section shall annually prepare a plan that identifies the intended uses of the amounts available to the State loan fund of the State.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:701 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An intended use plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a list of the projects to be assisted in the first fiscal year that begins after the date of the plan, including a description of the project, the expected terms of financial assistance, and the size of the community served;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the criteria and methods established for the distribution of funds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a description of the financial status of the State loan fund and the short-term and long-term goals of the State loan fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An intended use plan shall provide, to the maximum extent practicable, that priority for the use of funds be given to projects that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) address the most serious risk to human health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter (including requirements for filtration); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) assist systems most in need on a per household basis according to State affordability criteria.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) List of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall, after notice and opportunity for public comment, publish and periodically update a list of projects in the State that are eligible for assistance under this section, including the priority assigned to each project and, to the extent known, the expected funding schedule for each project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Fund management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State loan fund under this section shall be established, maintained, and credited with repayments and interest. The fund corpus shall be available in perpetuity for providing financial assistance under this section. To the extent amounts in the fund are not required for current obligation or expenditure, such amounts shall be invested in interest bearing obligations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assistance for disadvantaged communities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Loan subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in any case in which the State makes a loan pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section to a disadvantaged community or to a community that the State expects to become a disadvantaged community as the result of a proposed project, the State may provide additional subsidization (including forgiveness of principal).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Total amount of subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each fiscal year, the total amount of loan subsidies made by a State pursuant to paragraph (1) may not exceed 30 percent of the amount of the capitalization grant received by the State for the year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Disadvantaged community&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the term &ldquo;disadvantaged community&rdquo; means the service area of a public water system that meets affordability criteria established after public review and comment by the State in which the public water system is located. The Administrator may publish information to assist States in establishing affordability criteria.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each agreement under subsection (a) of this section shall require that the State deposit in the State loan fund from State moneys an amount equal to at least 20 percent of the total amount of the grant to be made to the State on or before the date on which the grant payment is made to the State, except that a State shall not be required to deposit such amount into the fund prior to the date on which each grant payment is made for fiscal years 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 if the State deposits the State contribution amount into the State loan fund prior to September 30, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Types of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise limited by State law, the amounts deposited into a State loan fund under this section may be used only&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) principal and interest payments on each loan will commence not later than 1 year after completion of the project for which the loan was made, and each loan will be fully amortized not later than 20 years after the completion of the project, except that in the case of a disadvantaged community (as defined in subsection (d)(3) of this section), a State may provide an extended term for a loan, if the extended term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) terminates not later than the date that is 30 years after the date of project completion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not exceed the expected design life of the project;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the recipient of each loan will establish a dedicated source of revenue (or, in the case of a privately owned system, demonstrate that there is adequate security) for the repayment of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the State loan fund will be credited with all payments of principal and interest on each loan;</p>
