<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for financial participation by the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) either provide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency to administer the plan, or provide for the establishment or designation of a single State agency to supervise the administration of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim for aid to families with dependent children is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide such methods of administration (including after January 1, 1940, methods relating to the establishment and maintenance of personnel standards on a merit basis, except that the Secretary shall exercise no authority with respect to the selection, tenure of office, and compensation of any individual employed in accordance with such methods) as are found by the Secretary to be necessary for the proper and efficient operation of the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) provide that the State agency will make such reports, in such form and containing such information, as the Secretary may from time to time require, and comply with such provisions as the Secretary may from time to time find necessary to assure the correctness and verification of such reports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) except as may be otherwise provided in paragraph (8) or (31) and section 615 of this title, provide that the State agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall, in determining need, take into consideration any other income and resources of any child or relative claiming aid to families with dependent children, or of any other individual (living in the same home as such child and relative) whose needs the State determines should be considered in determining the need of the child or relative claiming such aid;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall determine ineligible for aid any family the combined value of whose resources (reduced by any obligations or debts with respect to such resources) exceeds $1,000 or such lower amount as the State may determine, but not including as a resource for purposes of this subparagraph (i) a home owned and occupied by such child, relative, or other individual and so much of the family member's ownership interest in one automobile as does not exceed such amount as the Secretary may prescribe, (ii) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, burial plots (one for each such child, relative, and other individual), and funeral agreements&nbsp;<sup><a href="#602_1_target" name="602_1">1</a></sup> (iii) for such period or periods of time as the Secretary may prescribe, real property which the family is making a good-faith effort to dispose of, but any aid payable to the family for any such period shall be conditioned upon such disposal, and any payments of such aid for that period shall (at the time of the disposal) be considered overpayments to the extent that they would not have been made had the disposal occurred at the beginning of the period for which the payments of such aid were made, or (iv) for the month of receipt and the following month, any refund of Federal income taxes made to such family by reason of section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to earned income credit), and any payment made to such family by an employer under section 3507 of such Code (relating to advance payment of earned income credit); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may, in the case of a family claiming or receiving aid under this part for any month, take into consideration as income (to the extent the State determines appropriate, as specified in such plan, and notwithstanding any other provision of law)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an amount not to exceed the value of the family's monthly allotment of food <!-- PDFPage:1169 -->stamp coupons, to the extent such value duplicates the amount for food included in the maximum amount that would be payable under the State plan to a family of the same composition with no other income; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an amount not to exceed the value of any rent or housing subsidy provided to such family, to the extent such value duplicates the amount for housing included in the maximum amount that would be payable under the State plan to a family of the same composition with no other income;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall disregard all of the earned income of each dependent child receiving aid to families with dependent children who is (as determined by the State in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) a full-time student or a part-time student who is not a full-time employee attending a school, college, or university, or a course of vocational or technical training designed to fit him for gainful employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) shall disregard from the earned income of any child or relative applying for or receiving aid to families with dependent children, or of any other individual (living in the same home as such relative and child) whose needs are taken into account in making such determination, the first $90 of the total of such earned income for such month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) after applying the other clauses of this subparagraph, shall disregard from the earned income of any child, relative, or other individual specified in clause (ii), an amount equal to expenditures for care in such month for a dependent child, or an incapacitated individual living in the same home as the dependent child, receiving aid to families with dependent children and requiring such care for such month, to the extent that such amount (for each such dependent child or incapacitated individual) does not exceed $175 (or such lesser amount as the Secretary may prescribe in the case of an individual not engaged in full-time employment or not employed throughout the month), or, in the case such child is under age 2, $200;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) shall disregard from the earned income of any child or relative receiving aid to families with dependent children, or of any other individual (living in the same home as such relative and child) whose needs are taken into account in making such determination, an amount equal to (I) the first $30 of the total of such earned income not disregarded under any other clause of this subparagraph plus (II) one-third of the remainder thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) may disregard the income of any dependent child applying for or receiving aid to families with dependent children which is derived from a program carried out under the Job Training Partnership Act (as originally enacted) [29 U.S.C. 1501 et seq.], but only in such amounts, and for such period of time (not to exceed six months with respect to earned income) as the Secretary may provide in regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vi) shall disregard the first $50 of any child support payments for such month received in that month, and the first $50 of child support payments for each prior month received in that month if such payments were made by the absent parent in the month when due, with respect to the dependent child or children in any family applying for or receiving aid to families with dependent children (including support payments collected and paid to the family under section 657(b) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(vii) may disregard all or any part of the earned income of a dependent child who is a full-time student and who is applying for aid to families with dependent children, but only if the earned income of such child is excluded for such month in determining the family's total income under paragraph (18); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(viii) shall disregard any refund of Federal income taxes made to a family receiving aid to families with dependent children by reason of section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to earned income tax credit) and any payment made to such a family by an employer under section 3507 of such Code (relating to advance payment of earned income credit); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide that (with respect to any month) the State agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall not disregard, under clause (ii), (iii), or (iv) of subparagraph (A), any earned income of any one of the persons specified in subparagraph (A)(ii) if such person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) terminated his employment or reduced his earned income without good cause within such period (of not less than thirty days) preceding such month as may be prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) refused without good cause, within such period preceding such month as may be prescribed by the Secretary, to accept employment in which he is able to engage which is offered through the public employment offices of the State, or is otherwise offered by an employer if the offer of such employer is determined by the State or local agency administering the State plan, after notification by the employer, to be a bona fide offer of employment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) failed without good cause to make a timely report (as prescribed by the State plan pursuant to paragraph (14)) to the State agency of earned income received in such month; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii)(I) shall not disregard&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) in the case of the earned income of a person with respect to whom subparagraph (A)(iv) has been applied for four consecutive months, shall not apply the provisions of subclause (II) of such subparagraph to any month after such month, or apply the provisions of subclause (I) of such subparagraph to any month after the eighth month following such month, for so long as he continues to receive aid under the plan, and shall not apply the provisions of either such subclause to any month thereafter until the expiration of an additional period of twelve consecutive months during which he is not a recipient of such aid; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide that in implementing this paragraph the term &ldquo;earned income&rdquo; shall mean gross earned income, prior to any deductions for taxes or for any other purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide safeguards which restrict the use or disclosure of information concerning applicants or recipients to purposes directly connected with (A) the administration of the plan of the State approved under this part (including activities under part F of this subchapter), the plan or program of the State under part B, D, or E of this subchapter or under subchapter I, X, XIV, XVI, XIX, or XX of this chapter, or the supplemental security income program established by subchapter XVI of this chapter, (B) any investigation, prosecution, or criminal or civil proceeding, conducted in connection with the administration of any such plan or program, (C) the administration of any other Federal or federally assisted program which provides assistance, in cash or in kind, or services, directly to individuals on the basis of need, (D) any audit or similar activity conducted in connection with the administration of any such plan or program by any governmental entity which is authorized by law to conduct such audit or activity, and (E) reporting and providing information pursuant to paragraph (16) to appropriate authorities with respect to known or suspected child abuse or neglect; and the safeguards so provided shall prohibit disclosure, to any committee or legislative body (other than an entity referred to in clause (D) with respect to an activity referred to in such clause), of any information which identifies by name or address any such applicant or recipient; but such safeguards shall not prevent the State agency or the local agency responsible for the administration of the State plan in the locality (whether or not the State has enacted legislation allowing public access to Federal welfare records) from furnishing a State or local law enforcement officer, upon his request, with the current address of any recipient if the officer furnishes the agency with such recipient's name and social security account number and satisfactorily demonstrates that such recipient is a fugitive felon, that the location or apprehension of such felon is within the officer's official duties, and that the request is made in the proper exercise of those duties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10)(A) provide that all individuals wishing to make application for aid to families with dependent children shall have opportunity to do so, and that aid to families with dependent children shall, subject to paragraphs (25) and (26), be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provide that an application for aid under the plan will be effective no earlier than the date such application is filed with the State agency or local agency responsible for the administration of the State plan, and the amount payable for the month in which the application becomes effective, if such application becomes effective after the first day of such month, shall bear the same ratio to the amount which would be payable if the application had been effective on the first day of such month as the number of days in the month including and following the effective date of the application bears to the total number of days in such month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) provide for prompt notice (including the transmittal of all relevant information) to the State child support collection agency (established pursuant to part D of this subchapter) of the furnishing of aid to families with dependent children with respect to a child who has been deserted or abandoned by a parent (including a child born out of wedlock without regard to whether the paternity of such child has been established);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) provide, effective October 1, 1950, that no aid will be furnished any individual under the plan with respect to any period with respect to which he is receiving old-age assistance under the State plan approved under section 302 of this title;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall notify such State agency that further payments will not be made to the State (or, in his discretion, that payments will be limited to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure) until the Secretary is satisfied that such prohibited requirement is no longer so imposed, and that there is no longer any such failure to comply. Until he is so satisfied he shall make no further payments to such State (or shall limit payments to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with State statute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment to which a State is otherwise entitled under this part for any period before September 1, 1962, shall be withheld by reason of any action taken pursuant to a State statute which requires that aid be denied under the State plan approved under this part with respect to a child because of the conditions in the home in which the child resides; nor shall any such payment be withheld for any period beginning on or after such date by reason of any action taken pursuant to such a statute if provision is otherwise made pursuant to a State statute for adequate care and assistance with respect to such child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Good faith effort to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State shall be found, prior to January 1, 1977, to have failed substantially to comply with the requirements of section 602(a)(27) of this title if, in the judgment of the Secretary, such State is making a good faith effort to implement the program required by such section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">When used in this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The term &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; means a needy child (1) who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home (other than absence occasioned solely by reason of the performance of active duty in the uniformed services of the United States), or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, and who is living with his father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, or niece, in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home, and (2) who is (A) under the age of eighteen, or (B) at the option of the State, under the age of nineteen and a full-time student in a secondary school (or in the equivalent level of vocational or technical training), if, before he attains age nineteen, he may reasonably be expected to complete the program of such secondary school (or such training);</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; means money payments with respect to a dependent child or dependent children, or, at the option of the State, a pregnant woman but only if it has been medically verified that the child is expected to be born in the month such payments are made or within the three-month period following such month of payment, and who, if such child had been born and was living with her in the month of payment, would be eligible for aid to families with dependent children, and includes (1) money payments to meet the needs of the relative with whom any dependent child is living (and the spouse of such relative if living with him and if such relative is the child's parent and the child is a dependent child by reason of the physical or mental incapacity of a parent or is a dependent child under section 607 of this title), and (2) payments with respect to any dependent child (including payments to meet the needs of the relative, and the relative's spouse, with whom such child is living, and the needs of any other individual living in the same home if such needs are taken into account in making the determination under section 602(a)(7) of this title) which do not meet the preceding requirements of this subsection, but which would meet such requirements except that such payments are made to another individual who (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such child or relative, or are made on behalf of such child or relative directly to a person furnishing food, living accommodations, or other goods, services, or items to or for such child, relative, or other individual, but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 602 of this title includes provision for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determination by the State agency that the relative of the child with respect to whom such payments are made has such inability to manage funds that making payments to him would be contrary to the welfare of the child and, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid with respect to such child and relative through payments described in this clause (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) undertaking and continuing special efforts to develop greater ability on the part of the relative to manage funds in such manner as to protect the welfare of the family;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) periodic review by such State agency of the determination under clause (A) to ascertain whether conditions justifying such determination still exist, with provision for termination of such payments if they do not and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative, as described in section 1311 of this title, if and when it appears that the need for such payments is continuing, or is likely to continue, beyond a period specified by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on the determination referred to in clause (A) for any individual with respect to whom it is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments with respect to a dependent child which are intended to enable the recipient to pay for specific goods, services, or items recognized by the State agency as a part of the child's need under the State plan may (in the discretion of the State or local agency administering the plan in the political subdivision) be made, pursuant to a determination referred to in clause (2)(A), in the form of checks drawn jointly to the order of the recipient and the person furnishing such goods, services, or items and negotiable only upon endorsement by both such recipient and such person; and payments so made shall be considered for all of the purposes of this part to be payments described in clause (2). Whenever payments with respect to a dependent child are made in the manner described in clause (2) (including payments described in the preceding sentence), a statement of the specific reasons for making such payments in that manner (on which the determination under clause (2)(A) was based) shall be placed in the file maintained with respect to such child by the State or local agency administering the State plan in the political subdivision. Payments of the type described in clause (2) shall not be subject to the requirements of clauses (A) through (D) of such clause (2), when they are made in the manner described in clause (2) at the request of the family member to whom payment would otherwise be made in an unrestricted manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The term &ldquo;relative with whom any dependent child is living&rdquo; means the individual who is one of the relatives specified in subsection (a) of this section and with whom such child is living (within the meaning of such subsection) in a place of residence maintained by such individual (himself or together with any one or more of the other relatives so specified) as his (or their) own home.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1212 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) Repealed. Pub. L. 93&ndash;647, &sect;3(a)(5), Jan. 4, 1975, 88 Stat. 2348.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The term &ldquo;emergency assistance to needy families with children&rdquo; means any of the following, furnished for a period not in excess of 30 days in any 12-month period, in the case of a needy child under the age of 21 who is (or, within such period as may be specified by the Secretary, has been) living with any of the relatives specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home, but only where such child is without available resources, the payments, care, or services involved are necessary to avoid destitution of such child or to provide living arrangements in a home for such child, and such destitution or need for living arrangements did not arise because such child or relative refused without good cause to accept employment or training for employment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) money payments, payments in kind, or such other payments as the State agency may specify with respect to, or medical care or any other type of remedial care recognized under State law (for which such individual is not entitled to medical assistance under the State plan under subchapter XIX of this chapter) on behalf of, such child or any other member of the household in which he is living, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such services as may be specified by the Secretary;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 602 of this title includes provision for such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Emergency assistance as authorized under paragraph (1) may be provided under the conditions specified in such paragraph to migrant workers with families in the State or in such part or parts thereof as the State shall designate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; does not mean payments with respect to a parent (or other individual whose needs such State determines should be considered in determining the need of the child or relative claiming aid under the plan of such State approved under this part) of a child who fails to cooperate with any agency or official of the State in obtaining such support payments for such child. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to make an otherwise eligible child ineligible for protective payments because of the failure of such parent (or such other individual) to so cooperate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; does not mean any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amount paid to meet the needs of an unborn child; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) amount paid (or by which a payment is increased) to meet the needs of a woman occasioned by or resulting from her pregnancy, unless, as has been medically verified, the woman's child is expected to be born in the month such payments are made (or increased) or within the three-month period following such month of payment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Each dependent child, and each relative with whom such a child is living (including the spouse of such relative as described in subsection (b) of this section), who becomes ineligible for aid to families with dependent children as a result (wholly or partly) of the collection or increased collection of child or spousal support under part D of this subchapter, and who has received such aid in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which such ineligibility begins, shall be deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children for purposes of subchapter XIX of this chapter for an additional four calendar months beginning with the month in which such ineligibility begins.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(III) Any family that is otherwise eligible for aid to families with dependent children that does not receive such aid in any month solely by reason of the State exercising the option under clause (i) shall be deemed, for purposes of determining the period under paragraph (1)(A)(iii)(I), to be receiving such aid in such month.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;calendar quarter&rdquo; means a period of 3 consecutive calendar months ending on March 31, June 30, September 30, or December 31;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an individual shall, for purposes of subsection (b)(1)(A)(iii) of this section, be deemed qualified for unemployment compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) he would have been eligible to receive such unemployment compensation upon filing application, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) he performed work not covered under such law and such work, if it had been covered, would (together with any covered work he performed) have made him eligible to receive such unemployment compensation upon filing application; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the phrase &ldquo;whichever of such child's parents is the principal earner&rdquo;, in the case of any child, means whichever parent, in a home in which both parents of such child are living, earned the greater amount of income in the 24-month period the last month of which immediately precedes the month in which an application is filed for aid under this part on the basis of the unemployment of a parent, for each consecutive month for which the family receives such aid on that basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding section 602(a)(1) of this title, a State that chooses to exercise the option provided under paragraph (1)(B) may provide that the definition of calendar quarter under such option apply in one or more political subdivisions of the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Agreement with States for simplification of procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Secretary of Labor shall jointly enter into an agreement with each <!-- PDFPage:1217 -->State which is able and willing to do so for the purpose of (1) simplifying the procedures to be followed by unemployed parents and other unemployed persons in such State in participating in a program under part F of this subchapter and in registering with public employment offices (under this section and otherwise) or in connection with applications for unemployment compensation, by reducing the number of locations or agencies where such persons must go in order to participate in or register for such programs and in connection with such applications, and (2) providing where possible for a single registration satisfying this section and the requirements of both part F of this subchapter and the applicable unemployment compensation laws.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability; time period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits under a State plan ap<!-- PDFPage:1226 -->proved under this part for an individual who is an alien described in clause (B) of section 602(a)(33) of this title, the income and resources of any person who (as a sponsor of such individual's entry into the United States) executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement with respect to such individual, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse, shall be deemed to be the unearned income and resources of such individual (in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this section) for a period of three years after the individual's entry into the United States, except that this section is not applicable if such individual is a dependent child and such sponsor (or such sponsor's spouse) is the parent of such child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of income of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the unearned income of an alien for any month shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount of earned and unearned income of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined for such month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the lesser of (I) 20 percent of the total of any amounts received by the sponsor and his spouse in such month as wages or salary or as net earnings from self-employment, plus the full amount of any costs incurred by them in producing self-employment income in such month, or (II) $175;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the cash needs standard established by the State under its plan for a family of the same size and composition as the sponsor and those other individuals living in the same household as the sponsor who are claimed by him as dependents for purposes of determining his Federal personal income tax liability but whose needs are not taken into account in making a determination under section 602(a)(7) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any amounts paid by the sponsor (or his spouse) to individuals not living in such household who are claimed by him as dependents for purposes of determining his Federal personal income tax liability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) any payments of alimony or child support with respect to individuals not living in such household.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of resources of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the resources of an alien for any month shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount of the resources (determined as if the sponsor were applying for aid under the State plan approved under this part) of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by $1,500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision of information by alien concerning his sponsor; receipt of information from Departments of State and Justice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any individual who is an alien and whose sponsor was a public or private agency shall be ineligible for aid under a State plan approved under this part during the period of three years after his or her entry into the United States, unless the State agency administering such plan determines that such sponsor either no longer exists or has become unable to meet such individual's needs; and such determination shall be made by the State agency based upon such criteria as it may specify in the State plan, and upon such documentary evidence as it may therein require. Any such individual, and any other individual who is an alien (as a condition of his or her eligibility for aid under a State plan approved under this part during the period of three years after his or her entry into the United States), shall be required to provide to the State agency administering such plan such information and documentation with respect to his sponsor as may be necessary in order for the State agency to make any determination required under this section, and to obtain any cooperation from such sponsor necessary for any such determination. Such alien shall also be required to provide to the State agency such information and documentation as it may request and which such alien or his sponsor provided in support of such alien's immigration application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall enter into agreements with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General whereby any information available to them and required in order to make any determination under this section will be provided by them to the Secretary (who may, in turn, make such information available, upon request, to a concerned State agency), and whereby the Secretary of State and Attorney General will inform any sponsor of an alien, at the time such sponsor executes an affidavit of support or similar agreement, of the requirements imposed by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Joint and several liability of alien and sponsor for overpayment of aid during specified period following entry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any sponsor of an alien, and such alien, shall be jointly and severally liable for an amount equal to any overpayment of aid under the State plan made to such alien during the period of three years after such alien's entry into the United States, on account of such sponsor's failure to provide correct information under the provisions of this section, except where such sponsor was without fault, or where good cause of such failure existed. Any such overpayment which is not repaid to the State or recovered in accordance with the procedures generally applicable under the State plan to the recoupment of overpayments shall be withheld from any subsequent payment to which such alien or such sponsor is entitled under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Division of income and resources of individual sponsoring two or more aliens living in same home</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case where a person is the sponsor of two or more alien individuals who are living in the same home, the income and resources of such sponsor (and his spouse), to the extent they would be deemed the income and resources of any one of such individuals under the preceding provisions of this section, shall be divided into <!-- PDFPage:1227 -->two or more equal shares (the number of shares being the same as the number of such alien individuals) and the income and resources of each such individual shall be deemed to include one such share.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Income and resources of a sponsor (and his spouse) which are deemed under this section to be the income and resources of any alien individual in a family shall not be considered in determining the need of other family members except to the extent such income or resources are actually available to such other members.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Aliens not covered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply with respect to any alien who is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) admitted to the United States as a result of the application, prior to April 1, 1980, of the provisions of section 1153(a)(7) of title 8;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) admitted to the United States as a result of the application, after March 31, 1980, of the provisions of section 1157(c) of title 8;</p>
