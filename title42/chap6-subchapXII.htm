<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National primary drinking water regulations; maximum contaminant level goals; simultaneous publication of regulations and goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Effective on June 19, 1986, each national interim or revised primary drinking water regulation promulgated under this section before June 19, 1986, shall be deemed to be a national primary drinking water regulation under subsection (b) of this section. No such regulation shall be required to comply with the standards set forth in subsection (b)(4) of this section unless such regulation is amended to establish a different maximum contaminant level after June 19, 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After June 19, 1986, each recommended maximum contaminant level published before June 19, 1986, shall be treated as a maximum contaminant level goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a national primary drinking water regulation is proposed under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (b) of this section for any contaminant, the maximum contaminant level goal for such contaminant shall be proposed simultaneously. Whenever a national primary drinking water regulation is promulgated under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (b) of this section for any contaminant, the maximum contaminant level goal for such contaminant shall be published simultaneously.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (3) shall not apply to any recommended maximum contaminant level published before June 19, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standard setting schedules and deadlines; substitution of contaminants; additional contaminants; adequate safety margin in levels; &ldquo;feasible&rdquo; defined; technology, techniques, or other means to meet contaminant level; alternative treatment techniques; filtration and disinfection as required treatment techniques; amendment, review, effective date, and supersedure of regulations; addition of substances unrelated to contamination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of those contaminants listed in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in volume 47, Federal Register, page 9352, and in volume 48, Federal Register, page 45502, the Administrator shall publish maximum contaminant level goals and promulgate national primary drinking water regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not later than 12 months after June 19, 1986, for not less than 9 of those listed contaminants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not later than 24 months after June 19, 1986, for not less than 40 of those listed contaminants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not later than 36 months after June 19, 1986, for the remainder of such listed contaminants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the Administrator identifies a drinking water contaminant the regulation of which, in the judgment of the Administrator, is more likely to be protective of public health (taking into account the schedule for regulation under paragraph (1)) than a contaminant referred to in paragraph (1), the Administrator may publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for such identified contaminant in lieu of regulating the contaminant referred to in such paragraph. There may be no more than 7 contaminants in paragraph (1) for which substitutions may be made. Regulation of a contaminant identified under this paragraph shall be in accordance with the schedule applicable to the contaminant for which the substitution is made.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:625 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Administrator identifies one or more contaminants for substitution under this paragraph, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register not later than one year after June 19, 1986, a list of contaminants proposed for substitution, the contaminants referred to in paragraph (1) for which substitutions are to be made, and the basis for the judgment that regulation of such proposed substitute contaminants is more likely to be protective of public health (taking into account the schedule for regulation under such paragraph). Following a period of 60 days for public comment, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a final list of contaminants to be substituted and contaminants referred to in paragraph (1) for which substitutions are to be made, together with responses to significant comments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any contaminant referred to in paragraph (1) for which a substitution is made, pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, shall be included on the priority list to be published by the Administrator not later than January 1, 1988, pursuant to paragraph (3)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Administrator's decision to regulate a contaminant identified pursuant to this paragraph in lieu of a contaminant referred to in paragraph (1) shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Administrator shall publish maximum contaminant level goals and promulgate national primary drinking water regulations for each contaminant (other than a contaminant referred to in paragraph (1) or (2) for which a national primary drinking water regulation was promulgated) which, in the judgment of the Administrator, may have any adverse effect on the health of persons and which is known or anticipated to occur in public water systems. Not later than January 1, 1988, and at 3 year intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall publish a list of contaminants which are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems and which may require regulation under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For the purpose of establishing the list under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall form an advisory working group including members from the National Toxicology Program and the Environmental Protection Agency's Offices of Drinking Water, Pesticides, Toxic Substances, Ground Water, Solid Waste and Emergency Response and any others the Administrator deems appropriate. The Administrator's consideration of priorities shall include, but not be limited to, substances referred to in section 9601(14) of this title, and substances registered as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not later than 24 months after the listing of contaminants under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall publish proposed maximum contaminant level goals and national primary drinking water regulations for not less than 25 contaminants from the list established under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Not later than 36 months after the listing of contaminants under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall publish a maximum contaminant goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for those contaminants for which proposed maximum contaminant level goals and proposed national primary drinking water regulations were published under subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each maximum contaminant level goal established under this subsection shall be set at the level at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety. Each national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant for which a maximum contaminant level goal is established under this subsection shall specify a maximum level for such contaminant which is as close to the maximum contaminant level goal as is feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;feasible&rdquo; means feasible with the use of the best technology, treatment techniques and other means which the Administrator finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely under laboratory conditions, are available (taking cost into consideration). For the purpose of paragraph (4), granular activated carbon is feasible for the control of synthetic organic chemicals, and any technology, treatment technique, or other means found to be the best available for the control of synthetic organic chemicals must be at least as effective in controlling synthetic organic chemicals as granular activated carbon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Each national primary drinking water regulation which establishes a maximum contaminant level shall list the technology, treatment techniques, and other means which the Administrator finds to be feasible for purposes of meeting such maximum contaminant level, but a regulation under this paragraph shall not require that any specified technology, treatment technique, or other means be used for purposes of meeting such maximum contaminant level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The Administrator is authorized to promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation that requires the use of a treatment technique in lieu of establishing a maximum contaminant level, if the Administrator makes a finding that it is not economically or technologically feasible to ascertain the level of the contaminant. In such case, the Administrator shall identify those treatment techniques which, in the Administrator's judgment, would prevent known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons to the extent feasible. Such regulations shall specify each treatment technique known to the Administrator which meets the requirements of this paragraph, but the Administrator may grant a variance from any specified treatment technique in accordance with section 300g&ndash;4(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any schedule referred to in this subsection for the promulgation of a national primary drinking water regulation for any contaminant shall apply in the same manner if the regulation requires a treatment technique in lieu of establishing a maximum contaminant level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Not later than 18 months after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall propose and promulgate national primary drinking water regulations specifying criteria under which filtration (including coagulation and sedimentation, as appropriate) is required as a treatment technique for public water systems supplied by surface <!-- PDFPage:626 -->water sources. In promulgating such rules, the Administrator shall consider the quality of source waters, protection afforded by watershed management, treatment practices (such as disinfection and length of water storage) and other factors relevant to protection of health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In lieu of the provisions of section 300g&ndash;4 of this title the Administrator shall specify procedures by which the State determines which public water systems within its jurisdiction shall adopt filtration under the criteria of clause (i). The State may require the public water system to provide studies or other information to assist in this determination. The procedures shall provide notice and opportunity for public hearing on this determination. If the State determines that filtration is required, the State shall prescribe a schedule for compliance by the public water system with the filtration requirement. A schedule shall require compliance within 18 months of a determination made under clause (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Within 18 months from the time that the Administrator establishes the criteria and procedures under this subparagraph, a State with primary enforcement responsibility shall adopt any necessary regulations to implement this subparagraph. Within 12 months of adoption of such regulations the State shall make determinations regarding filtration for all the public water systems within its jurisdiction supplied by surface waters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If a State does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems, the Administrator shall have the same authority to make the determination in clause (ii) in such State as the State would have under that clause. Any filtration requirement or schedule under this subparagraph shall be treated as if it were a requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Not later than 36 months after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall propose and promulgate national primary drinking water regulations requiring disinfection as a treatment technique for all public water systems. The Administrator shall simultaneously promulgate a rule specifying criteria that will be used by the Administrator (or delegated State authorities) to grant variances from this requirement according to the provisions of sections 300g&ndash;4(a)(1)(B) and 300g&ndash;4(a)(3) of this title.

Such regulations shall require that before a determination of the Administrator that such requirements are met or are no longer met with respect to a State may become effective, the Administrator shall notify such State of the determination and the reasons therefor and shall provide an opportunity for public hearing on the determination. Such regulations shall be promulgated (with such modifications as the Administrator deems appropriate) within 90 days of the publication of the proposed regulations in the <!-- PDFPage:628 -->Federal Register.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for which a variance under section 300g&ndash;4 or an exemption under section 300g&ndash;5 of this title is not in effect, does not comply with any national primary drinking water regulation in effect under section 300g&ndash;1 of this title, or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial determinations in appropriate Federal district courts; civil penalties, separate violations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may bring a civil action in the appropriate United States district court to require compliance with a national primary drinking water regulation with an order issued under subsection (g) of this section, or with any schedule or other requirement imposed pursuant to a variance or exemption granted under section 300g&ndash;4 or 300g&ndash;5 of this title if&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Administrator shall by regulation prescribe the form, manner, and frequency for giving notice under this subsection. Within 15 months after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall amend such regulations to provide for different types and frequencies of notice based on the differences between violations which are intermittent or infrequent and violations which are continuous or frequent. Such regulations shall also take into account the seriousness of any potential adverse health effects which may be involved. Notice of any violation of a maximum contaminant level or any other violation designated by the Administrator as posing a serious potential adverse health effect shall be given as soon as possible, but in no case later than 14 days after the violation. Notice of a continuous violation of a regulation other than a maximum contaminant level shall be given no less frequently than every 3 months. Notice of violations judged to be less serious shall be given no less frequently than annually. The Administrator shall specify the types of notice to be used to provide information as promptly and effectively as possible taking into account both the seriousness of any potential adverse health effects and the likelihood of reaching all affected persons. Notification of violations shall include notice by general circulation newspaper serving the area and, whenever appropriate, shall also include a press release to electronic media and individual mailings. Notice under this subsection shall provide a clear and readily understandable explanation of the violation, any potential adverse health effects, the steps that the system is taking to correct such violation, and the necessity for seeking alternative water supplies, if any, until the violation is corrected. Until such amended regulations are promulgated, the regulations in effect on June 19, 1986, shall remain in effect. The Administrator may also require the owner or operator of a public water system to give notice to the persons served by it of contaminant levels of any unregulated contaminant required to be monitored under section 300j&ndash;4(a) of this title. Any person who violates this subsection or regulations issued under this subsection shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $25,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice of noncompliance with secondary drinking water regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, on the basis of information available to him, the Administrator finds that within a reasonable time after national secondary drinking water regulations have been promulgated, one or more public water systems in a State do not comply with such secondary regulations, and that such noncompliance appears to result from a failure of such State to take reasonable action to assure that public water systems throughout such State meet such secondary regulations, he shall so notify the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State authority to adopt or enforce laws or regulations respecting drinking water regulations or public water systems unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall diminish any authority of a State or political subdivision to adopt or enforce any law or regulation respecting drinking water regulations or public water systems, but no such law or regulation shall relieve any person of any requirement otherwise applicable under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notice and public hearing; availability of recommendations transmitted to State and public water system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator makes a finding of noncompliance (described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section) with respect to a public water system in a State which has primary enforcement responsibility, the Administrator may, for the purpose of assisting that State in carrying out such responsibility and upon the petition of such State or public water system or persons served by such system, hold, after appropriate notice, public hearings for the purpose of gathering information from technical or other experts, Federal, State, or other public officials, representatives of such public water system, persons served by such system, and other interested persons on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ways in which such system can within the earliest feasible time be brought into compliance with the regulation or requirement with respect to which such finding was made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the means for the maximum feasible protection of the public health during any period in which such system is not in compliance with a national primary drinking water regulation or requirement applicable to a variance or exemption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">On the basis of such hearings the Administrator shall issue recommendations which shall be sent to such State and public water system and shall be made available to the public and communications media.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Administrative order requiring compliance; notice and hearing; civil penalty; civil actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which the Administrator is authorized to bring a civil action under this section or under section 300j&ndash;4 of this title with respect to any regulation, schedule, or other requirement, the Administrator also may issue an order to require compliance with such regulation, schedule, or other requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order issued under this subsection shall not take effect until after notice and opportunity for public hearing and, in the case of a State having primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in that State, until after the Administrator has provided the State <!-- PDFPage:630 -->with an opportunity to confer with the Administrator regarding the proposed order. A copy of any order proposed to be issued under this subsection shall be sent to the appropriate State agency of the State involved if the State has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in that State. Any order issued under this subsection shall state with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation. In any case in which an order under this subsection is issued to a corporation, a copy of such order shall be issued to appropriate corporate officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any person who violates, or fails or refuses to comply with, an order under this subsection shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Whenever any civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this paragraph does not exceed a total of $5,000, the penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Whenever any civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this paragraph exceeds $5,000, the penalty shall be assessed by a civil action brought by the Administrator in the appropriate United States district court (as determined under the provisions of title 28).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court of appeals has entered final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Attorney General shall recover the amount for which such person is liable in any appropriate district court of the United States. In any such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Characteristics of raw water sources; specific treatment technique; notice to Administrator, reasons for variance; compliance, enforcement; approval or revision of schedules and revocation of variances; review of variances and schedules; publication in Federal Register, notice and results of review; notice to State; considerations respecting abuse of discretion in granting variances or failing to prescribe schedules; State corrective action; authority of Administrator in a State without primary enforcement responsibility; alternative treatment techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, variances from national primary drinking water regulations may be granted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) A State which has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems may grant one or more variances from an applicable national primary drinking water regulation to one or more public water systems within its jurisdiction which, because of characteristics of the raw water sources which are reasonably available to the systems, cannot meet the requirements respecting the maximum contaminant levels of such drinking water regulation. A variance may only be issued to a system after the system's application of the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means, which the Administrator finds are available (taking costs into consideration). The Administrator shall propose and promulgate his finding of the best available technology, treatment techniques or other means available for each contaminant for purposes of this subsection at the time he proposes and promulgates a maximum contaminant level for each such contaminant. The Administrator's finding of best available technology, treatment techniques or other means for purposes of this subsection may vary depending on the number of persons served by the system or for other physical conditions related to engineering feasibility and costs of compliance with maximum contaminant levels as considered appropriate by the Administrator. Before a State may grant a variance under this subparagraph, the State <!-- PDFPage:631 -->must find that the variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to health. If a State grants a public water system a variance under this subparagraph, the State shall prescribe at the time the variance is granted, a schedule for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) compliance (including increments of progress) by the public water system with each containment level requirement with respect to which the variance was granted, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) implementation by the public water system of such additional control measures as the State may require for each contaminant, subject to such contaminant level requirement, during the period ending on the date compliance with such requirement is required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Before a schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to this subparagraph may take effect, the State shall provide notice and opportunity for a public hearing on the schedule. A notice given pursuant to the preceding sentence may cover the prescribing of more than one such schedule and a hearing held pursuant to such notice shall include each of the schedules covered by the notice. A schedule prescribed pursuant to this subparagraph for a public water system granted a variance shall require compliance by the system with each contaminant level requirement with respect to which the variance was granted as expeditiously as practicable (as the State may reasonably determine).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A State which has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems may grant to one or more public water systems within its jurisdiction one or more variances from any provision of the national primary drinking water regulation which requires the use of a specified treatment technique with respect to a contaminant if the public water system applying for the variance demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State that such treatment technique is not necessary to protect the health of persons because of the nature of the raw water source of such system. A variance granted under this subparagraph shall be conditioned on such monitoring and other requirements as the Administrator may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Before a variance proposed to be granted by a State under subparagraph (A) or (B) may take effect, such State shall provide notice and opportunity for public hearing on the proposed variance. A notice given pursuant to the preceding sentence may cover the granting of more than one variance and a hearing held pursuant to such notice shall include each of the variances covered by the notice. The State shall promptly notify the Administrator of all variances granted by it. Such notification shall contain the reason for the variance (and in the case of a variance under subparagraph (A), the basis for the finding required by that subparagraph before the granting of the variance) and documentation of the need for the variance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Each public water system's variance granted by a State under subparagraph (A) shall be conditioned by the State upon compliance by the public water system with the schedule prescribed by the State pursuant to that subparagraph. The requirements of each schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to that subparagraph shall be enforceable by the State under its laws. Any requirement of a schedule on which a variance granted under that subparagraph is conditioned may be enforced under section 300g&ndash;3 of this title as if such requirement was part of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Each schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be deemed approved by the Administrator unless the variance for which it was prescribed is revoked by the Administrator under subparagraph (G) or the schedule is revised by the Administrator under such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Not later than 18 months after the effective date of the interim national primary drinking water regulations the Administrator shall complete a comprehensive review of the variances granted under subparagraph (A) (and schedules prescribed pursuant thereto) and under subparagraph (B) by the States during the one-year period beginning on such effective date. The Administrator shall conduct such subsequent reviews of variances and schedules as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, but each subsequent review shall be completed within each 3-year period following the completion of the first review under this subparagraph. Before conducting any review under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall publish notice of the proposed review in the Federal Register. Such notice shall (i) provide information respecting the location of data and other information respecting the variances to be reviewed (including data and other information concerning new scientific matters bearing on such variances), and (ii) advise of the opportunity to submit comments on the variances reviewed and on the need for continuing them. Upon completion of any such review, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the results of his review together with findings responsive to comments submitted in connection with such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G)(i) If the Administrator finds that a State has, in a substantial number of instances, abused its discretion in granting variances under subparagraph (A) or (B) or that in a substantial number of cases the State has failed to prescribe schedules in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall notify the State of his findings. In determining if a State has abused its discretion in granting variances in a substantial number of instances, the Administrator shall consider the number of persons who are affected by the variances and if the requirements applicable to the granting of the variances were complied with. A notice under this clause shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) identify each public water system with respect to which the finding was made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) specify the reasons for the finding, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) as appropriate, propose revocations of specific variances or propose revised schedules or other requirements for specific public water systems granted variances, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Administrator shall provide reasonable notice and public hearing on the provi<!-- PDFPage:632 -->sions of each notice given pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph. After a hearing on a notice pursuant to such clause, the Administrator shall (I) rescind the finding for which the notice was given and promptly notify the State of such rescission, or (II) promulgate (with such modifications as he deems appropriate) such variance revocations and revised schedules or other requirements proposed in such notice as he deems appropriate. Not later than 180 days after the date a notice is given pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph, the Administrator shall complete the hearing on the notice and take the action required by the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) If a State is notified under clause (i) of this subparagraph of a finding of the Administrator made with respect to a variance granted a public water system within that State or to a schedule or other requirement for a variance and if, before a revocation of such variance or a revision of such schedule or other requirement promulgated by the Administrator takes effect, the State takes corrective action with respect to such variance or schedule or other requirement which the Administrator determines makes his finding inapplicable to such variance or schedule or other requirement, the Administrator shall rescind the application of his finding to that variance on schedule or other requirement. No variance revocation or revised schedule or other requirement may take effect before the expiration of 90 days following the date of the notice in which the revocation or revised schedule or other requirement was proposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If a State does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems, the Administrator shall have the same authority to grant variances in such State as the State would have under paragraph (1) if it had primary enforcement responsibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Administrator may grant a variance from any treatment technique requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation upon a showing by any person that an alternative treatment technique not included in such requirement is at least as efficient in lowering the level of the contaminant with respect to which such requirement was prescribed. A variance under this paragraph shall be conditioned on the use of the alternative treatment technique which is the basis of the variance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enforcement of schedule or other requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any schedule or other requirement on which a variance granted under paragraph (1)(B) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section is conditioned may be enforced under section 300g&ndash;3 of this title as if such schedule or other requirement was part of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applications for variances; regulations: reasonable time for acting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an application for a variance under subsection (a) of this section is made, the State receiving the application or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall act upon such application within a reasonable period (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Administrator) after the date of its submission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Treatment technique requirement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;treatment technique requirement&rdquo; means a requirement in a national primary drinking water regulation which specifies for a contaminant (in accordance with section 300f(1)(C)(ii) of this title) each treatment technique known to the Administrator which leads to a reduction in the level of such contaminant sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 300g&ndash;1(b)(3) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requisite findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State which has primary enforcement responsibility may exempt any public water system within the State's jurisdiction from any requirement respecting a maximum contaminant level or any treatment technique requirement, or from both, of an applicable national primary drinking water regulation upon a finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) due to compelling factors (which may include economic factors), the public water system is unable to comply with such contaminant level or treatment technique requirement,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public water system was in operation on the effective date of such contaminant level or treatment technique requirement, or, for a system that was not in operation by that date, only if no reasonable alternative source of drinking water is available to such new system, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the granting of the exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk to health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance schedule and implementation of control measures; notice and hearing; dates for compliance with schedule; extension of final date for compliance; compliance, enforcement; approval or revision of schedules and revocation of exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a State grants a public water system an exemption under subsection (a) of this section, the State shall prescribe, at the time the exemption is granted, a schedule for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) compliance (including increments of progress) by the public water system with <!-- PDFPage:633 -->each contaminant level requirement and treatment technique requirement with respect to which the exemption was granted, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) implementation by the public water system of such control measures as the State may require for each contaminant, subject to such contaminant level requirement or treatment technique requirement, during the period ending on the date compliance with such requirement is required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before a schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to this subsection may take effect, the State shall provide notice and opportunity for a public hearing on the schedule. A notice given pursuant to the preceding sentence may cover the prescribing of more than one such schedule and a hearing held pursuant to such notice shall include each of the schedules covered by the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A schedule prescribed pursuant to this subsection for a public water system granted an exemption under subsection (a) of this section shall require compliance by the system with each contaminant level and treatment technique requirement with respect to which the exemption was granted as expeditiously as practicable (as the State may reasonably determine) but (except as provided in subparagraph (B))&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in the case of an exemption granted with respect to a contaminant level or treatment technique requirement prescribed by the national primary drinking water regulations promulgated under section 300g&ndash;1(a) of this title, not later than 12 months after June 19, 1986; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of an exemption granted with respect to a contaminant level or treatment technique requirement prescribed by national primary drinking water regulations, other than a regulation referred to in section 300g&ndash;1(a) of this title, 12 months after the date of the issuance of the exemption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The final date for compliance provided in any schedule in the case of any exemption may be extended by the State (in the case of a State which has primary enforcement responsibility) or by the Administrator (in any other case) for a period not to exceed 3 years after the date of the issuance of the exemption if the public water system establishes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the system cannot meet the standard without capital improvements which cannot be completed within the period of such exemption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a system which needs financial assistance for the necessary improvements, the system has entered into an agreement to obtain such financial assistance; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each public water system's exemption granted by a State under subsection (a) of this section shall be conditioned by the State upon compliance by the public water system with the schedule prescribed by the State pursuant to this subsection. The requirements of each schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to this subsection shall be enforceable by the State under its laws. Any requirement of a schedule on which an exemption granted under this section is conditioned may be enforced under section 300g&ndash;3 of this title as if such requirement was part of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to Administrator; reasons for exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State which grants an exemption under subsection (a) of this section shall promptly notify the Administrator of the granting of such exemption. Such notification shall contain the reasons for the exemption (including the basis for the finding required by subsection (a)(3) of this section before the exemption may be granted) and document the need for the exemption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of exemptions and schedules; publication in Federal Register, notice and results of review; notice to State; considerations respecting abuse of discretion in granting exemptions or failing to prescribe schedules; State corrective action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 18 months after the effective date of the interim national primary drinking water regulations the Administrator shall complete a comprehensive review of the exemptions granted (and schedules prescribed pursuant thereto) by the States during the one-year period beginning on such effective date. The Administrator shall conduct such subsequent reviews of exemptions and schedules as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, but each subsequent review shall be completed within each 3-year period following the completion of the first review under this subparagraph.

Upon completion of any such review, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the results of his review, together with findings responsive to comments submitted in connection with such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the Administrator finds that a State has, in a substantial number of instances, <!-- PDFPage:634 -->abused its discretion in granting exemptions under subsection (a) of this section or failed to prescribe schedules in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall notify the State of his findings. In determining if a State has abused its discretion in granting exemptions in a substantial number of instances, the Administrator shall consider the number of persons who are affected by the exemptions and if the requirements applicable to the granting of the exemptions were complied with.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator shall provide reasonable notice and public hearing on the provisions of each notice given pursuant to subparagraph (A). After a hearing on notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall (i) rescind the finding for which the notice was given and promptly notify the State of such rescission, or (ii) promulgate (with such modifications as he deems appropriate) such exemption revocations and revised schedules proposed in such notice as he deems appropriate. Not later than 180 days after the date a notice is given pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall complete the hearing on the notice and take the action required by the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a State is notified under subparagraph (A) of a finding of the Administrator made with respect to an exemption granted a public water system within that State or to a schedule prescribed pursuant to such an exemption and if before a revocation of such exemption or a revision of such schedule promulgated by the Administrator takes effect the State takes corrective action with respect to such exemption or schedule which the Administrator determines makes his finding inapplicable to such exemption or schedule, the Administrator shall rescind the application of his finding to that exemption or schedule. No exemption revocation or revised schedule may take effect before the expiration of 90 days following the date of the notice in which the revocation or revised schedule was proposed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Treatment technique requirement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;treatment technique requirement&rdquo; means a requirement in a national primary drinking water regulation which specifies for a contaminant (in accordance with section 300f(1)(C)(ii) of this title) each treatment technique known to the Administrator which leads to a reduction in the level of such contaminant sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 300g&ndash;1(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authority of Administrator in a State without primary enforcement responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems, the Administrator shall have the same authority to exempt public water systems in such State from maximum contaminant level requirements and treatment technique requirements under the same conditions and in the same manner as the State would be authorized to grant exemptions under this section if it had primary enforcement responsibility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applications for exemptions; regulations; reasonable time for acting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an application for an exemption under this section is made, the State receiving the application or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall act upon such application within a reasonable period (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Administrator) after the date of its submission.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Publication of proposed regulations; promulgation; amendments; public hearings; administrative consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall publish proposed regulations for State underground injection control programs within 180 days after December 16, 1974. Within 180 days after publication of such proposed regulations, he shall promulgate such regulations with such modifications as he deems <!-- PDFPage:636 -->appropriate. Any regulation under this subsection may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any regulation under this section shall be proposed and promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title 5 (relating to rulemaking), except that the Administrator shall provide opportunity for public hearing prior to promulgation of such regulations. In proposing and promulgating regulations under this section the Administrator shall consult with the Secretary, the National Drinking Water Advisory Council, and other appropriate Federal entities and with interested State entities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum requirements; restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations under subsection (a) of this section for State underground injection programs shall contain minimum requirements for effective programs to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources within the meaning of subsection (d)(2) of this section. Such regulations shall require that a State program, in order to be approved under section 300h&ndash;1 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall prohibit, effective on the date on which the applicable underground injection control program takes effect, any underground injection in such State which is not authorized by a permit issued by the State (except that the regulations may permit a State to authorize underground injection by rule);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall require (i) in the case of a program which provides for authorization of underground injection by permit, that the applicant for the permit to inject must satisfy the State that the underground injection will not endanger drinking water sources, and (ii) in the case of a program which provides for such an authorization by rule, that no rule may be promulgated which authorizes any underground injection which endangers drinking water sources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall include inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall apply (i) as prescribed by section 300j&ndash;6(b) of this title, to underground injections by Federal agencies, and (ii) to underground injections by any other person whether or not occurring on property owned or leased by the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Regulations of the Administrator under this section for State underground injection control programs may not prescribe requirements which interfere with or impede&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the underground injection of brine or other fluids which are brought to the surface in connection with oil or natural gas production or natural gas storage operations, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless such requirements are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by such injection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The regulations of the Administrator under this section shall permit or provide for consideration of varying geologic, hydrological, or historical conditions in different States and in different areas within a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In prescribing regulations under this section the Administrator shall, to the extent feasible, avoid promulgation of requirements which would unnecessarily disrupt State underground injection control programs which are in effect and being enforced in a substantial number or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300h_1_target" name="300h_1">1</a></sup> States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For the purpose of this subparagraph, a regulation prescribed by the Administrator under this section shall be deemed to disrupt a State underground injection control program only if it would be infeasible to comply with both such regulation and the State underground injection control program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For the purpose of this subparagraph, a regulation prescribed by the Administrator under this section shall be deemed unnecessary only if, without such regulation, underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by an underground injection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter or affect the duty to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by any underground injection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary permits; notice and hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator may, upon application of the Governor of a State which authorizes underground injection by means of permits, authorize such State to issue (without regard to subsection (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section) temporary permits for underground injection which may be effective until the, expiration of four years after December 16, 1974, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Administrator finds that the State has demonstrated that it is unable and could not reasonably have been able to process all permit applications within the time available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Administrator determines the adverse effect on the environment of such temporary permits is not unwarranted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such temporary permits will be issued only with respect to injection wells in operation on the date on which such State's permit program approved under this part first takes effect and for which there was inadequate time to process its permit application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Administrator determines the temporary permits require the use of adequate safeguards established by rules adopted by him.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may, upon application of the Governor of a State which authorizes underground injection by means of permits, authorize such State to issue (without regard to subsection (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section), but after reasonable notice and hearing, one or more temporary permits each of which is applicable to a particular injection well and to the underground injection of a particular fluid and which may be effective until the expiration of four years after December 16, 1974, if the State finds, on the record of such hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that technology (or other means) to permit safe injection of the fluid in accordance with the applicable underground injection control program is not generally available (taking costs into consideration);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that injection of the fluid would be less harmful to health than the use of other available means of disposing of waste or producing the desired product; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:637 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that available technology or other means have been employed (and will be employed) to reduce the volume and toxicity of the fluid and to minimize the potentially adverse effect of the injection on the public health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Underground injection&rdquo; defined; underground injection endangerment of drinking water sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;underground injection&rdquo; means the subsurface emplacement of fluids by well injection. Such term does not include the underground injection of natural gas for purposes of storage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Underground injection endangers drinking water sources if such injection may result in the presence in underground water which supplies or can reasonably be expected to supply any public water system of any contaminant, and if the presence of such contaminant may result in such system's not complying with any national primary drinking water regulation or may otherwise adversely affect the health of persons.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) List of States in need of a control program; amendment of list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 180 days after December 16, 1974, the Administrator shall list in the Federal Register each State for which in his judgment a State underground injection control program may be necessary to assure that underground injection will not endanger drinking water sources. Such list may be amended from time to time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State applications; notice to Administrator of compliance with revised or added requirements; approval or disapproval by Administrator; duration of State primary enforcement responsibility; public hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Each State listed under subsection (a) of this section shall within 270 days after the date of promulgation of any regulation under section 300h of this title (or, if later, within 270 days after such State is first listed under subsection (a) of this section) submit to the Administrator an application which contains a showing satisfactory to the Administrator that the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) has adopted after reasonable notice and public hearings, and will implement, an underground injection control program which meets the requirements of regulations in effect under section 300h of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) will keep such records and make such reports with respect to its activities under its underground injection control program as the Administrator may require by regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Administrator may, for good cause, extend the date for submission of an application by any State under this subparagraph for a period not to exceed an additional 270 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within 270 days of any amendment of a regulation under section 300h of this title revising or adding any requirement respecting State underground injection control programs, each State listed under subsection (a) of this section shall submit (in such form and manner as the Administrator may require) a notice to the Administrator containing a showing satisfactory to him that the State underground injection control program meets the revised or added requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within ninety days after the State's application under paragraph (1)(A) or notice under paragraph (1)(B) and after reasonable opportunity for presentation of views, the Administrator shall by rule either approve, disapprove, or approve in part and disapprove in part, the State's underground injection control program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Administrator approves the State's program under paragraph (2), the State shall have primary enforcement responsibility for underground water sources until such time as the Administrator determines, by rule, that such State no longer meets the requirements of clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before promulgating any rule under paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection, the Administrator shall provide opportunity for public hearing respecting such rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program by Administrator for State without primary enforcement responsibility; restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator disapproves a State's program (or part thereof) under subsection (b)(2) of this section, if the Administrator determines under subsection (b)(3) of this section that a State no longer meets the requirements of clause (i) or (ii) of subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, or if a State fails to submit an application or notice before the date of expiration of the period specified in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator shall by regulation within 90 days after the date of such disapproval, determination, or expiration (as the case may be) prescribe (and may from time to time by regulation revise) a program applicable to such State meeting the requirements of section 300h(b) of this title. Such program may not include requirements which interfere with or impede&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the underground injection of brine or other fluids which are brought to the surface in connection with oil or natural gas production or natural gas storage operations, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:638 --><p class="statutory-body-block">unless such requirements are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by such injection. Such program shall apply in such State to the extent that a program adopted by such State which the Administrator determines meets such requirements is not in effect. Before promulgating any regulation under this section, the Administrator shall provide opportunity for public hearing respecting such regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Applicable underground injection control program&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;applicable underground injection control program&rdquo; with respect to a State means the program (or most recent amendment thereof) (1) which has been adopted by the State and which has been approved under subsection (b) of this section, or (2) which has been prescribed by the Administrator under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Primary enforcement responsibility by Indian Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An Indian Tribe may assume primary enforcement responsibility for underground injection control under this section consistent with such regulations as the Administrator has prescribed pursuant to this part and section 300j&ndash;11 of this title. The area over which such Indian Tribe exercises governmental jurisdiction need not have been listed under subsection (a) of this section, and such Tribe need not submit an application to assume primary enforcement responsibility within the 270-day deadline noted in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section. Until an Indian Tribe assumes primary enforcement responsibility, the currently applicable underground injection control program shall continue to apply. If an applicable underground injection control program does not exist for an Indian Tribe, the Administrator shall prescribe such a program pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and consistent with section 300h(b) of this title, within 270 days after June 19, 1986, unless an Indian Tribe first obtains approval to assume primary enforcement responsibility for underground injection control.</p>

Appellant shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal by certified mail to the Administrator and to the Attorney General. The Administrator shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record on which such order was imposed. The district court shall not set aside or remand such order unless there is not substantial evidence on the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or, unless the Administrator's assessment of penalty or requirement for compliance constitutes an abuse of discretion. The district court shall not impose additional civil penalties for the same violation unless the Administrator's assessment of a penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. Notwithstanding section 300j&ndash;7(a)(2) of this title, any order issued under paragraph (3) shall be subject to judicial review exclusively under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after the order becomes effective under paragraph (3), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after a court, in an action brought under paragraph (6), has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator,</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;300h&ndash;3. Interim regulation of underground injections</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Necessity for well operation permit; designation of one aquifer areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person may petition the Administrator to have an area of a State (or States) designated as an area in which no new underground injection well may be operated during the period beginning on the date of the designation and ending on the date on which the applicable underground injection control program covering such area takes effect unless a permit for the operation of such well has been issued by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section. The Administrator may so designate an area within a State if he finds that the area has one aquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon receipt of a petition under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator shall publish it in the Federal Register and shall provide an opportunity to interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments thereon. Not later than the 30th day following the date of the publication of a petition under this paragraph in the Federal Register, the Administrator shall either make the designation for which the petition is submitted or deny the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Well operation permits; publication in Federal Register; notice and hearing; issuance or denial; conditions for issuance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the period beginning on the date an area is designated under subsection (a) of this section and ending on the date the applicable underground injection control program covering such area takes effect, no new underground injection well may be operated in such area unless the Administrator has issued a permit for such operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person may petition the Administrator for the issuance of a permit for the operation of such a well in such an area. A petition submitted under this paragraph shall be submitted in such manner and contain such information as the Administrator may require by regulation. Upon receipt of such a petition, the Administrator shall publish it in the Federal Register. The Administrator shall give notice of any proceeding on a petition and shall provide opportunity for agency hearing. The Administrator shall act upon such petition on the record of any hearing held pursuant to the preceding sentence respecting such petition. Within 120 days of the publication in the Federal Register of a petition submitted under this paragraph, the Administrator shall either issue the permit for which the petition was submitted or shall deny its issuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator may issue a permit for the operation of a new underground injection well in an area designated under subsection (a) of this section only, if he finds that the operation of such well will not cause contamination of the aquifer of such area so as to create a significant hazard to public health. The Administrator may condition the issuance of such a permit upon the use of such control measures in connection with the operation of such well, for which the permit is to be issued, as he deems necessary to assure that the operation of the well will not contaminate the aquifer of the designated area in which the well is located so as to create a significant hazard to public health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Civil penalties; separate violations; penalties for willful violations; temporary restraining order or injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who operates a new underground injection well in violation of subsection (b) of this section, (1) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day in which such violation occurs, or (2) if such violation is willful, such person may, in lieu of the civil penalty authorized by clause (1), be fined not more than $10,000 for each day in which such violation occurs. If the Administrator has reason to believe that any person is violating or will violate subsection (b) of this section, he may petition the United States district court to issue a temporary restraining order or injunction (including a mandatory injunction) to enforce such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;New underground injection well&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;new underground injection well&rdquo; means an underground injection well whose operation was not approved by appropriate State and Federal agencies before December 16, 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Areas with one aquifer; publication in Federal Register; commitments for Federal financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator determines, on his own initiative or upon petition, that an area has an <!-- PDFPage:641 -->aquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health, he shall publish notice of that determination in the Federal Register. After the publication of any such notice, no commitment for Federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment for Federal financial assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for development, implementation, and assessment of demonstration programs designed to protect critical aquifer protection areas located within areas designated as sole or principal source aquifers under section 300h&ndash;3(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Critical aquifer protection area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;critical aquifer protection area&rdquo; means either of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) All or part of an area located within an area for which an application or designation as a sole or principal source aquifer pursuant to section 300h&ndash;3(e) of this title, has been submitted and approved by the Administrator not later than 24 months after June 19, 1986, and which satisfies the criteria established by the Administrator under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All or part of an area which is within an aquifer designated as a sole source aquifer as of June 19, 1986, and for which an areawide ground water quality protection plan has been approved under section 208 of the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1288] prior to June 19, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State, municipal or local government or political subdivision thereof or any planning entity (including any interstate regional planning entity) that identifies a critical aquifer protection area over which it has authority or jurisdiction may apply to the Administrator for the selection of such area for a demonstration program under this section. Any applicant shall consult with other government or planning entities with authority or jurisdiction in such area prior to application. Applicants, other than the Governor, shall submit the application for a demonstration program jointly with the Governor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall, by rule, establish criteria for identifying critical aquifer protection areas under this section. In establishing such criteria, the Administrator shall consider each of the following:</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;300h&ndash;7. State programs to establish wellhead protection areas</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Governor or Governor's designee of each State shall, within 3 years of June 19, 1986, adopt and submit to the Administrator a State program to protect wellhead areas within their jurisdiction from contaminants which may have any adverse effect on the health of persons. Each State program under this section shall, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) specify the duties of State agencies, local governmental entities, and public water supply systems with respect to the development and implementation of programs required by this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for each wellhead, determine the wellhead protection area as defined in subsection (e) of this section based on all reasonably available hydrogeologic information on ground water flow, recharge and discharge and other information the State deems necessary to adequately determine the wellhead protection area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) identify within each wellhead protection area all potential anthropogenic sources of contaminants which may have any adverse effect on the health of persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) describe a program that contains, as appropriate, technical assistance, financial assistance, implementation of control measures, education, training, and demonstration projects to protect the water supply within wellhead protection areas from such contaminants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) include contingency plans for the location and provision of alternate drinking water supplies for each public water system in the event of well or wellfield contamination by such contaminants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) include a requirement that consideration be given to all potential sources of such contaminants within the expected wellhead area of a new water well which serves a public water supply system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Public participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the maximum extent possible, each State shall establish procedures, including but not limited to the establishment of technical and citizens&rsquo; advisory committees, to encourage the public to participate in developing the protection program for wellhead areas. Such procedures shall include notice and opportunity for public hearing on the State program before it is submitted to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disapproval</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the judgment of the Administrator, a State program (or portion thereof, including the definition of a wellhead protection area), is not adequate to protect public water systems as required by this section, the Administrator shall disapprove such program (or portion thereof). A State program developed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed to be adequate unless the Administrator determines, within 9 months of the receipt of a State program, that such program (or portion thereof) is inadequate for the purpose of protecting public water systems as required by this section from contaminants that may have any adverse effect on the health of persons. If the Administrator determines that a proposed State program (or any portion thereof) is inadequate, the Administrator shall submit a written statement of the reasons for such determination to the Governor of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Modification and resubmission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after receipt of the Administrator's written notice under paragraph (1) that any proposed State program (or portion thereof) is inadequate, the Governor or Governor's designee, shall modify the program based upon the recommendations of the Administrator and resubmit the modified program to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Federal assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the date 3 years after June 19, 1986, no State shall receive funds authorized to be appropriated under this section except for the purpose of implementing the program and requirements of paragraphs (4) and (6) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Wellhead protection area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;wellhead protection area&rdquo; means the surface and sub<!-- PDFPage:645 -->surface area surrounding a water well or wellfield, supplying a public water system, through which contaminants are reasonably likely to move toward and reach such water well or wellfield. The extent of a wellhead protection area, within a State, necessary to provide protection from contaminants which may have any adverse effect on the health of persons is to be determined by the State in the program submitted under subsection (a) of this section. Not later than one year after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall issue technical guidance which States may use in making such determinations. Such guidance may reflect such factors as the radius of influence around a well or wellfield, the depth of drawdown of the water table by such well or wellfield at any given point, the time or rate of travel of various contaminants in various hydrologic conditions, distance from the well or wellfield, or other factors affecting the likelihood of contaminants reaching the well or wellfield, taking into account available engineering pump tests or comparable data, field reconnaissance, topographic information, and the geology of the formation in which the well or wellfield is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Activities under other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No funds authorized to be appropriated under this section may be used to support activities authorized by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.], the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.], the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 [42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.], or other sections of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Individual sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No funds authorized to be appropriated under this section may be used to bring individual sources of contamination into compliance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State shall make every reasonable effort to implement the State wellhead area protection program under this section within 2 years of submitting the program to the Administrator. Each State shall submit to the Administrator a biennial status report describing the State's progress in implementing the program. Such report shall include amendments to the State program for water wells sited during the biennial period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government having jurisdiction over any potential source of contaminants identified by a State program pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section shall be subject to and comply with all requirements of the State program developed according to subsection (a)(4) of this section applicable to such potential source of contaminants, both substantive and procedural, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as any other person is subject to such requirements, including payment of reasonable charges and fees. The President may exempt any potential source under the jurisdiction of any department, agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch if the President determines it to be in the paramount interest of the United States to do so. No such exemption shall be granted due to the lack of an appropriation unless the President shall have specifically requested such appropriation as part of the budgetary process and the Congress shall have failed to make available such requested appropriations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Additional requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, States in which there are more than 2,500 active wells at which annular injection is used as of January 1, 1986, shall include in their State program a certification that a State program exists and is being adequately enforced that provides protection from contaminants which may have any adverse effect on the health of persons and which are associated with the annular injection or surface disposal of brines associated with oil and gas production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) &ldquo;Annular injection&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;annular injection&rdquo; means the reinjection of brines associated with the production of oil or gas between the production and surface casings of a conventional oil or gas producing well.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall conduct a review of each program certified under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State fails to include the certification required by this subsection or if in the judgment of the Administrator the State program certified under this subsection is not being adequately enforced, the Administrator shall disapprove the State program submitted under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Coordination with other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall authorize or require any department, agency, or other instrumentality of the Federal Government or State or local government to apportion, allocate or otherwise regulate the withdrawal or beneficial use of ground or surface waters, so as to abrogate or modify any existing rights to water established pursuant to State or Federal law, including interstate compacts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the State program is disapproved under this section, the Administrator shall make grants to the State for not less than 50 or more than 90 percent of the costs incurred by a State (as determined by the Administrator) in developing and implementing each State program under this section. For purposes of making such grants there is authorized to be appropriated not more than the following amounts:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) From allotments made pursuant to paragraph (4), the Administrator may make grants to States to carry out public water system supervision programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No grant may be made under paragraph (1) unless an application therefor has been submitted to the Administrator in such form and manner as he may require. The Administrator may not approve an application of a State for its first grant under paragraph (1) unless he determines that the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has established or will establish within one year from the date of such grant a public water system supervision program, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will, within that one year, assume primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">No grant may be made to a State under paragraph (1) for any period beginning more than one year after the date of the State's first grant unless the State has assumed and maintains primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State. The prohibitions contained in the preceding two sentences shall not apply to such grants when made to Indian Tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A grant under paragraph (1) shall be made to cover not more than 75 per centum of the grant recipient's costs (as determined under regulations of the Administrator) in carrying out, during the one-year period beginning on the date the grant is made, a public water system supervision program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In each fiscal year the Administrator shall, in accordance, with regulations, allot the sums appropriated for such year under paragraph (5) among the States on the basis of population, geographical area, number of public water systems, and other relevant factors. No State shall receive less than 1 per centum of the annual appropriation for grants under paragraph (1): <em>Provided,</em> That the Administrator may, by regulation, reduce such percentage in accordance with the criteria specified in this paragraph: <em>And provided further,</em> That such percentage shall not apply to grants allotted to Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands.</p>

The remaining 25 per centum of the amount allotted to such State for such fiscal year shall be retained by the Administrator, and the Administrator may award such amount to such State at such time as the State assumes such responsibility before the beginning of fiscal year 1980. At the beginning of each fiscal years 1979 and 1980 the amounts retained by the Administrator for any preceding fiscal year and not awarded by the beginning of fiscal year 1979 or 1980 to the States to which such amounts were originally allotted may be removed from the original allotment and reallotted for fiscal year 1979 or 1980 (as the case may be) to States which have assumed primary enforcement responsibility by the beginning of such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Administrator shall notify the State of the approval or disapproval of any application for a grant under this section&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Persons subject to requirements; size of system and likely contaminants as considerations for monitoring; monitoring for unregulated contaminants; notification of availability of results; waiver of monitoring requirement; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Every person who is a supplier of water, who is or may be otherwise subject to a primary drinking water regulation prescribed under section 300g&ndash;1 of this title or to an applicable underground injection control program (as defined in section 300h&ndash;1(c) of this title), who is or may be subject to the permit requirement of section 300h&ndash;3 of this title, or to an order issued under section 300j of this title, or who is a grantee, shall establish and maintain such records, make such reports, conduct such monitoring, and provide such information as the Administrator may reasonably require by regulation to assist him in establishing regulations under this subchapter, in determining whether such person has acted or is acting in compliance with this subchapter in administering any program of financial assistance under this subchapter, in evaluating the health risks of unregulated contaminants, or in advising the public of such risks. In requiring a public water system to monitor under this subsection, the Administrator may take into consideration the system size and the contaminants likely to be found in the system's drinking water.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 18 months after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations requiring every public water system to conduct a monitoring program for unregulated <!-- PDFPage:655 -->contaminants. The regulations shall require monitoring of drinking water supplied by the system and shall vary the frequency and schedule of monitoring requirements for systems based on the number of persons served by the system, the source of supply, and the contaminants likely to be found. Each system shall be required to monitor at least once every 5 years after the effective date of the Administrator's regulations unless the Administrator requires more frequent monitoring.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Regulations under paragraph (2) shall list unregulated contaminants for which systems may be required to monitor, and shall include criteria by which the primary enforcement authority in each State could show cause for addition or deletion of contaminants from the designated list. The primary State enforcement authority may delete contaminants for an individual system, in accordance with these criteria, after obtaining approval of assessment of the contaminants potentially to be found in the system. The Administrator shall approve or disapprove such an assessment submitted by a State within 60 days. A State may add contaminants, in accordance with these criteria, without making an assessment, but in no event shall such additions increase Federal expenditures authorized by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Public water systems conducting monitoring of unregulated contaminants pursuant to this section shall provide the results of such monitoring to the primary enforcement authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notification of the availability of the results of the monitoring programs required under paragraph (2), and notification of the availability of the results of the monitoring program referred to in paragraph (6), shall be given to the persons served by the system and the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Administrator may waive the monitoring requirement under paragraph (2) for a system which has conducted a monitoring program after January 1, 1983, if the Administrator determines the program to have been consistent with the regulations promulgated under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Any system supplying less than 150 service connections shall be treated as complying with this subsection if such system provides water samples or the opportunity for sampling according to rules established by the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) There are authorized to be appropriated $30,000,000 in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1987&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300j-4_1_target" name="300j-4_1">1</a></sup> to remain available until expended to carry out the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Entry of establishments, facilities, or other property; inspections; conduct of certain tests; audit and examination of records; entry restrictions; prohibition against informing of a proposed entry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Administrator, or representatives of the Administrator duly designated by him, upon presenting appropriate credentials and a written notice to any supplier of water or other person subject to (A) a national primary drinking water regulation prescribed under section 300g&ndash;1 of this title, (B) an applicable underground injection control program, or (C) any requirement to monitor an unregulated contaminant pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, or person in charge of any of the property of such supplier or other person referred to in clause (A), (B), or (C), is authorized to enter any establishment, facility, or other property of such supplier or other person in order to determine whether such supplier or other person has acted or is acting in compliance with this subchapter, including for this purpose, inspection, at reasonable times, of records, files, papers, processes, controls, and facilities, or in order to test any feature of a public water system, including its raw water source. The Administrator or the Comptroller General (or any representative designated by either) shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any records, reports, or information of a grantee which are required to be maintained under subsection (a) of this section or which are pertinent to any financial assistance under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No entry may be made under the first sentence of paragraph (1) in an establishment, facility, or other property of a supplier of water or other person subject to a national primary drinking water regulation if the establishment, facility, or other property is located in a State which has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems unless, before written notice of such entry is made, the Administrator (or his representative) notifies the State agency charged with responsibility for safe drinking water of the reasons for such entry. The Administrator shall, upon a showing by the State agency that such an entry will be detrimental to the administration of the State's program of primary enforcement responsibility, take such showing into consideration in determining whether to make such entry. No State agency which receives notice under this paragraph of an entry proposed to be made under paragraph (1) may use the information contained in the notice to inform the person whose property is proposed to be entered of the proposed entry; and if a State agency so uses such information, notice to the agency under this paragraph is not required until such time as the Administrator determines the agency has provided him satisfactory assurances that it will no longer so use information contained in a notice under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whoever fails or refuses to comply with any requirement of subsection (a) of this section or to allow the Administrator, the Comptroller General, or representatives of either, to enter and conduct any audit or inspection authorized by subsection (b) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $25,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Confidential information; trade secrets and secret processes; information disclosure; &ldquo;information required under this section&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), upon a showing satisfactory to the Administrator by any person that any information required under this section from such person, if made public, would divulge trade secrets or secret processes of such person, the Administrator shall consider such informa<!-- PDFPage:656 -->tion confidential in accordance with the purposes of section 1905 of title 18. If the applicant fails to make a showing satisfactory to the Administrator, the Administrator shall give such applicant thirty days&rsquo; notice before releasing the information to which the application relates (unless the public health or safety requires an earlier release of such information).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any information required under this section (A) may be disclosed to other officers, employees, or authorized representatives of the United States concerned with carrying out this subchapter or to committees of the Congress, or when relevant in any proceeding under this subchapter, and (B) shall be disclosed to the extent it deals with the level of contaminants in drinking water. For purposes of this subsection the term &ldquo;information required under this section&rdquo; means any papers, books, documents, or information, or any particular part thereof, reported to or otherwise obtained by the Administrator under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Grantee&rdquo; and &ldquo;person&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, (1) the term &ldquo;grantee&rdquo; means any person who applies for or receives financial assistance, by grant, contract, or loan guarantee under this subchapter, and (2) the term &ldquo;person&rdquo; includes a Federal agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Information regarding drinking water coolers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may utilize the authorities of this section for purposes of part F of this subchapter. Any person who manufactures, imports, sells, or distributes drinking water coolers in interstate commerce shall be treated as a supplier of water for purposes of applying the provisions of this section in the case of persons subject to part F of this subchapter.</p>

The preceding sentence shall apply (A) to any requirement whether substantive or procedural (including any recordkeeping or reporting requirement, any requirement respecting permits, and any other requirement whatsoever), (B) to the exercise of any Federal, State, or local administrative authority, and (C) to any process or sanction, whether enforced in Federal, State, or local courts or in any other manner. This subsection shall apply, notwithstanding any immunity of such agencies, under any law or rule of law.

Upon the issuance of such a waiver, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register a notice that the waiver was granted for national security purposes, unless, upon the request of the Secretary of Defense, the Administrator determines to omit such publication because the publication itself would be contrary to the interests of national security, in which event the Administrator shall submit notice to the Armed Services Committee of the Senate and House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Indian rights and sovereignty as unaffected; &ldquo;Federal agency&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Nothing in the Safe Drinking Water Amendments of 1977 shall be construed to alter or affect the status of American Indian lands or water rights nor to waive any sovereignty over Indian lands guaranteed by treaty or statute.</p>
