If coverage is modified under the plan for any group of similarly situated beneficiaries, such coverage shall also be modified in the same manner for all individuals who are qualified beneficiaries under the plan pursuant to this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300bb-2_1_target" name="300bb-2_1">1</a></sup> in connection with such group.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period of coverage</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) End of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The date on which the employer ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Failure to pay premium</h4>

The payment of any premium (other than any payment referred to in the last sentence of paragraph (3)) shall be considered to be timely if made within 30 days after the date due or within such longer period as applies to or under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Group health plan coverage or medicare entitlement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The date on which the qualified beneficiary first becomes, after the date of the election&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) covered under any other group health plan (as an employee or otherwise) which does not contain any exclusion or limitation with respect to any preexisting condition of such beneficiary (other than such an exclusion or limitation which does not apply to (or is satisfied by) such beneficiary by reason of chapter 100 of title 26, part 7 of subtitle B of title I of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1181 et seq.], or subchapter XXV of this chapter), or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall not exceed 102 percent of the applicable premium for such period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may, at the election of the payor, be made in monthly installments.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In no event may the plan require the payment of any premium before the day which is 45 days after the day on which the qualified beneficiary made the initial election for continuation coverage.<sup><a href="#300bb-2_2_target" name="300bb-2_2">2</a></sup> In the case of an individual described in the last sentence of paragraph (2)(A), any reference in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph to &ldquo;102 percent&rdquo; is deemed a reference to &ldquo;150 percent&rdquo; for any month after the 18th month of continuation coverage described in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No requirement of insurability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The coverage may not be conditioned upon, or discriminate on the basis of lack of, evidence of insurability.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Conversion option</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a qualified beneficiary whose period of continuation coverage expires under paragraph (2)(A), the plan must, during the 180-day period ending on such expiration date, provide to the qualified beneficiary the option of enrollment under a conversion health plan otherwise generally available under the plan.</p>
