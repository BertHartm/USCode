<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">This subparagraph shall not be construed to prohibit a State from imposing more stringent standards and licensing or regulatory requirements on child care providers within the State that provide services for which assistance is provided under this subchapter than the standards or requirements imposed on other child care providers in the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Establishment of health and safety requirements</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payment rates</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State plan shall provide assurances that payment rates for the provision of child care services for which assistance is provided under this subchapter are sufficient to ensure equal access for eligible children to comparable child care services in the State or substate area that are provided to children whose parents are not eligible to receive assistance under this subchapter or for child care assistance under any other Federal or State programs. Such payment rates shall take into account the variations in the costs of providing child care in different settings and to children of different age groups, and the additional costs of providing child care for children with special needs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to create a private right of action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Sliding fee scale</h4>
