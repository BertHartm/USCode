<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Repealed. Pub. L. 97&ndash;35, title XXI, &sect;2184(c)(2)(A), Aug. 13, 1981, 95 Stat. 817.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam, an amount equal to one-half of the total of the sums expended during such quarter as aid to the permanently and totally disabled under the State plan, not counting so much of any expenditure with respect to any month as exceeds $37.50 multiplied by the total number of recipients of aid to the permanently and totally disabled for such month; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any State, an amount equal to 50 percent of the total amounts expended during such quarter as found necessary by the Secretary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The method of computing and paying such amounts shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall, prior to the beginning of each quarter, estimate the amount to be paid to the State for such quarter under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, such estimate to be based on (A) a report filed by the State containing its estimate of the total sum to be expended in such quarter in accordance with the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, and stating the amount appropriated or made available by the State and its political subdivisions for such expenditures in such quarter, and if such amount is less than the State's proportionate share of the total sum of such estimated expenditures, the source or sources from which the difference is expected to be derived, (B) records showing the number of permanently and totally disabled individuals in the State, and (C) such other investigation as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall then certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the amount so estimated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, (A) reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum by which he finds that his estimate for any prior quarter was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State under subsection (a) of this section for such quarter, and (B) reduced by a sum equivalent to the pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, of the net amount recovered during a prior quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to aid to the permanently and totally disabled furnished under the State plan; except that such increases or reductions shall not be made to the extent that such sums have been applied to make the amount certified for any prior quarter greater or less than the amount estimated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for such prior quarter: <em>Provided</em>, That any part of the amount recovered from the estate of a deceased recipient which is not in excess of the amount expended by the State or any political subdivision thereof for the funeral expenses of the deceased shall not be considered as a basis for reduction under clause (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall thereupon, through the Fiscal Service of the Treasury Department, and prior to audit or settlement by the Government Accountability Office, pay to the State, at the time or times fixed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the amount so certified.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;aid to the permanently and totally disabled&rdquo; means money payments to needy individuals eighteen years of age or older who are permanently and totally disabled, but does not include any such payments to or care in behalf of any individual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution) or any individual who is a patient in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases. Such term also includes payments which are not included within the meaning of such term under the preceding sentence, but which would be so included except that they are made on behalf of such a needy individual to another individual who (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such needy individual, but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 1352 of this title includes provision for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) determination by the State agency that such needy individual has, by reason of his physical or mental condition, such inability to manage funds that making payments to him would be contrary to his welfare and, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid through payments described in this sentence;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) making such payments only in cases in which such payments will, under the rules otherwise applicable under the State plan for determining need and the amount of aid to the permanently and totally disabled to be paid (and in conjunction with other income and resources), meet all the need&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1355_1_target" name="1355_1">1</a></sup> of the individuals with respect to whom such payments are made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) undertaking and continuing special efforts to protect the welfare of such individual and to improve, to the extent possible, his capacity for self-care and to manage funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) periodic review by such State agency of the determination under paragraph (1) to ascertain whether conditions justifying such determination still exist, with provision for termination of such payments if they do not and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative, as described in section 1311 of this title, if and when it appears that such action will best serve the interests of such needy individual; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on the determination referred to in paragraph (1) for any individual with respect to whom it is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">At the option of a State (if its plan approved under this subchapter so provides), such term (i) need not include money payments to an individual who has been absent from such State for a period in excess of ninety consecutive days (regardless of whether he has maintained his residence in such State during such period) until he has been present in such State for thirty consecutive days in the case of such an individual who has maintained his residence in such State during such period or ninety consecutive days in the case of any other such individual, and (ii) <!-- PDFPage:2262 -->may include rent payments made directly to a public housing agency on behalf of a recipient or a group or groups of recipients of aid under such plan.</p>
