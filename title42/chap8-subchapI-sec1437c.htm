<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contract authorization; amounts; use as security for obligations of public housing agency; use of existing structures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may make annual contributions to public housing agencies to assist in achieving and maintaining the lower income character of their projects. The Secretary shall embody the provisions for such annual contributions in a contract guaranteeing their payment. The contribution payable annually under this section shall in no case exceed a sum equal to the annual amount of principal and interest payable on obligations issued by the public housing agency to finance the development or acquisition cost of the lower income project involved. Annual contributions payable under this section shall be pledged, if the Secretary so requires, as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency to assist the development or acquisition of the project to which annual contributions relate and shall be paid over a period not to exceed 40 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may make contributions (in the form of grants) to public housing agencies to cover the development cost of public housing projects. The contract under which such contributions shall be made shall specify the amount of capital contributions required for each project to which the contract pertains, and that the terms and conditions of such contract shall remain in effect for a 40-year period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of contributions that would be established for a newly constructed project by a public housing agency designed to accommodate a number of families of a given size and kind may be established under this section for a project by such public housing agency that would provide housing for the comparable number, sizes, and kinds of families through the acquisition and rehabilitation, or use under lease, of structures that are suitable for low-income housing use and obtained in the local market.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Maximum amount of contributions; regulations; criteria for rates of contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may prescribe regulations fixing the maximum contributions available under different circumstances, giving consideration to cost, location, size, rent-paying ability of prospective tenants, or other factors bearing upon the amounts and periods of assistance needed to achieve and maintain low rentals. Such regulations may provide for rates of contribution based upon development, acquisition, or operation costs, number of dwelling units, number of persons housed, interest charges, or other appropriate factors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on aggregate contractual contributions; contracts for preliminary loans; payments of annual contributions; limitations on specific authorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may enter into contracts for annual contributions aggregating not more than $7,875,049,000 per annum, which amount shall be increased by $1,494,400,000 on October 1, 1980, and by $906,985,000 on October 1, 1981.

In addition, the aggregate amount which may be obligated over the duration of the contracts may not exceed $31,200,000,000 with respect to the additional authority provided on October 1, 1980, and $18,087,370,000 with respect to the additional authority provided on October 1, 1981.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall enter into only such new contracts for preliminary loans as are consistent with the number of dwelling units for which contracts for annual contributions may be entered into.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The full faith and credit of the United States is solemnly pledged to the payment of all annual contributions contracted for pursuant to this section, and there are hereby authorized to be appropriated in each fiscal year, out of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the amounts necessary to provide for such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) All payments of annual contributions pursuant to this section shall be made out of any funds available for purposes of this chapter when such payments are due, except that funds obtained through the issuance of obligations pursuant to section 1437b(b) of this title (including repayments or other realizations of the principal of loans made out of such funds) shall not be available for the payment of such annual contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) During such period as the Secretary may prescribe for starting construction, the Secretary may approve the conversion of public housing development authority for use under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title or for use for the acquisition and rehabilitation of property to be used in public housing, if the public housing agency, after consultation with the unit of local government, certifies that such assistance would be more effectively used for such purpose, and if the total number of units assisted will not be less than 90 per centum of the units covered by the original reservation.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Scope of contracts for loans or annual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any contract for loans or annual contributions, or both, entered into by the Secretary with a public housing agency, may cover one or more than one low-income housing project owned by such public housing agency; in the event the contract covers two or more projects, such projects may, for any of the purposes of this chapter and of such contract (including, but not limited to, the determination of the amount of the loan, annual contributions, or payments in lieu of taxes, specified in such contract), be treated collectively as one project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Local determination of need as prerequisite for contracts for preliminary loans, and contracts for loans or annual contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In recognition that there should be local determination of the need for low-income housing <!-- PDFPage:2274 -->to meet needs not being adequately met by private enterprise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Secretary shall not make any contract with a public housing agency for preliminary loans (all of which shall be repaid out of any moneys which become available to such agency for the development of the projects involved) for surveys and planning in respect to any low-income housing projects (i) unless the governing body of the locality involved has by resolution approved the application of the public housing agency for such preliminary loan; and (ii) unless the public housing agency has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Secretary that there is need for such low-income housing which is not being met by private enterprise; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary shall not make any contract for loans (other than preliminary loans) or for contributions pursuant to this chapter unless the governing body of the locality involved has entered into an agreement with the public housing agency providing for the local cooperation required by the Secretary pursuant to this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Modification by Secretary of terms of contracts, etc.; limitations; amendment or supersedure of contracts for annual contributions or loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the specific limitations or standards in this chapter governing the terms of sales, rentals, leases, loans, contracts for annual contributions, or other agreements, the Secretary may, whenever he deems it necessary or desirable in the fulfillment of the purposes of this chapter, consent to the modification, with respect to rate of interest, time of payment of any installment of principal or interest, security, amount of annual contribution, or any other term, of any contract or agreement of any kind to which the Secretary is a party. When the Secretary finds that it would promote economy or be in the financial interest of the Federal Government or is necessary to assure or maintain the lower income character of the project or projects involved, any contract heretofore or hereafter made for annual contributions, loans, or both, may be amended or superseded by a contract entered into by mutual agreement between the public housing agency and the Secretary. Contracts may not be amended or superseded in a manner which would impair the rights of the holders of any outstanding obligations of the public housing agency involved for which annual contributions have been pledged. Any rule of law contrary to this provision shall be deemed inapplicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Pledge of annual contributions as guarantee of payment of obligations issued by public housing agency; exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authority of the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section to pledge annual contributions as security for obligations issued by a public housing agency, the Secretary is authorized to pledge annual contributions as a guarantee of payment by a public housing agency of all principal and interest on obligations issued by it to assist the development or acquisition of the project to which the annual contributions relate, except that no obligation shall be guaranteed under this subsection if the income thereon is exempt from Federal taxation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Sale of project to lower income tenants by public housing agency; terms and conditions; commitment by Secretary to pay annual contribution unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a public housing agency may sell a low-income housing project to its lower income tenants, on such terms and conditions as the agency may determine, without affecting the Secretary's commitment to pay annual contributions with respect to that project, but such contributions shall not exceed the maximum contributions authorized under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Installation of passive or active solar energy systems</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In entering into contracts for assistance with respect to newly constructed or substantially rehabilitated projects under this section (other than for projects assisted pursuant to section 1437f of this title), the Secretary shall require the installation of a passive or active solar energy system in any such project where the Secretary determines that such installation would be cost effective over the estimated life of the system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Limitation on public housing development; assurance of public housing quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After September 30, 1987, in providing assistance under this chapter to a public housing agency for public housing, the Secretary shall reserve funds for the development of public housing only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Secretary determines that additional amounts are required to complete the development of dwelling units for which amounts are obligated on or before such date;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the public housing agency certifies to the Secretary that 85 percent of the public housing dwelling units of the public housing agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) are maintained in substantial compliance with the housing quality standards established by the Secretary under section 1437f(<em>o</em>)(6) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which funding has been awarded; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) will be so maintained upon completion of modernization for which applications are pending that have been submitted in good faith under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title (or a comparable State or local government program) and that there is a reasonable expectation, as determined by the Secretary in writing, that the applications would be approved;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the public housing agency certifies that such development&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) will replace dwelling units that are disposed of or demolished by the public housing agency, including dwelling units disposed of or lost through sale to tenants or through units redesign; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) is required to comply with court orders or directions of the Secretary;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the public housing agency certifies that it has demands for family housing not sat<!-- PDFPage:2275 -->isfied by the rental assistance programs established in subsection (b) or (<em>o</em>) of section 1437f of this title for which it plans to construct or acquire projects of not more than 100 units;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) in the case of an application for development of projects (or portions of projects) designated under section 1437e(a)(1) of this title for occupancy for elderly families, only if the agency certifies to the Secretary that the use of such assistance will assist in expanding the housing available for eligible persons with disabilities identified in the allocation plan for the agency submitted under section 1437e(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the Secretary makes such reservation under paragraph (2).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary may reserve not more than 20 percent of any amounts appropriated for development of public housing in each fiscal year for the substantial redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment of existing obsolete public housing projects or buildings and for the costs of improving the management and operation of projects undergoing redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment under this paragraph (to the extent that such improvement is necessary to maintain the physical improvements resulting from such redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;obsolete public housing project or building&rdquo; means a public housing project or building (i) having design or marketability problems resulting in vacancy in more than 25 percent of the units, or (ii)(I) for which the costs for redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment (including any costs for lead-based paint abatement activities) exceed 70 percent of the total development cost limits for new construction of similar units in the area, and (II) which has an occupancy density or a building height that is significantly in excess of that which prevails in the neighborhood in which the project is located, a bedroom configuration that could be altered to better serve the needs of families seeking occupancy to dwellings of the public housing agency, significant security problems in and around the project, or significant physical deterioration or inefficient energy and utility systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall allocate amounts reserved under this section to public housing agencies on the basis of a competition among public housing agencies applying for such amounts. The competition shall be based on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the management capability of the public housing agency to carry out the redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the expected term of the useful life of the project or building after redesign, reconstruction or redevelopment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the likelihood of achieving full occupancy within the projects or buildings of the agency that are to be assisted under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall establish limitations on the total costs of any project or building receiving amounts under this paragraph for redesign, reconstruction, and redevelopment. The cost limitations shall not be related to the total development cost system for new development or to the cost limits for modernization and shall recognize the higher direct costs of such work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Assistance may not be provided under this paragraph for any project or building assisted under section 1437<em>l</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) For each fiscal year for which amounts are reserved or appropriated for the purposes of this paragraph, the Secretary shall establish performance goals to evaluate the effectiveness of the use of such amounts. The goals shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) be designed to maximize the effectiveness of the expenditures in a quantifiable manner; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) describe the number of units to be redesigned, redeveloped, and reconstructed with such amounts and improvements in the management of projects so assisted to be accomplished with such amounts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Not later than 60 days after the end of each such fiscal year, the Secretary shall submit a report to the Congress, which shall describe the performance goals established for the fiscal year, the activities carried out with such amounts, and a statement of whether the performance goals were met. If the performance goals were not met, the report shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) an explanation of why the goals were not met and a description of any managerial deficiencies or legal problems that contributed to not meeting such goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) plans and a schedule for achieving the level of performance under such performance goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) recommendations for legislative or regulatory changes necessary to achieve the performance goals or improve performance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) a statement of whether the performance goals established for the fiscal year were impractical or infeasible, and, if so, the factors that contributed and resulted in establishing such impractical or infeasible goals and recommendations of actions to meet such goals, which may include changing the goals or altering or eliminating the program under this paragraph for major reconstruction of projects.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary shall commit for use under clause (ii) not less than 5 percent of any amounts reserved under subparagraph (A) for each such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The amounts referred to in clause (i) shall be available to public housing agencies only for use for projects (or portions of projects) designated for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) and (e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title by disabled families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In allocating amounts reserved under this subparagraph among public housing agencies, the Secretary shall consider the need for any such amounts as identified in the allocation plans submitted by agencies under section 1437e(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In fiscal years 1993 and 1994, the Secretary shall reserve for use under subparagraph (B) not less than 5 percent of any amounts approved in appropriation Acts for each such fiscal year for public housing grants under subsection (a)(2) of this section that are not designated <!-- PDFPage:2276 -->under such Acts for use under paragraph (2) of this subsection for the substantial redesign, reconstruction, or redevelopment of existing public housing projects, buildings, or units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any amount reserved under subparagraph (A) shall be available only to public housing agencies that have designated projects (or portions of projects) for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) of this title for use only for the costs of development or acquisition of public housing projects or buildings designated for occupancy under section 1437e(a)(1) and (e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title by disabled families. A building so assisted may not contain more than 25 dwelling units, except that the Secretary may (in the discretion of the Secretary) waive such limitation for a building.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall carry out a competition for budget authority reserved under subparagraph (A) among eligible public housing agencies and shall allocate such budget authority to public housing agencies pursuant to the competition, based on (i) the need of the agency for such assistance (taking into consideration the allocation plans submitted under section 1437e(f)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title by agencies), and (ii) the extent to which the public housing projects and buildings to be developed or assisted meet the requirements of section 1437e(e)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1437c_4_target" name="1437c_4">4</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Limitation on recapture of funding reservations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the reservation of public housing development funds to a public housing agency, the Secretary may not recapture any of the amounts included in such reservation due to the failure of a public housing agency to begin construction or rehabilitation, or to complete acquisition, during the 30-month period following the date of such reservation. During such 30-month period, the public housing agency shall be permitted to change the site of the public housing project or reformulate the project, if not less than the original number of dwelling units are to be constructed, rehabilitated, or acquired. There shall be excluded from the computation of such 30-month period any delay in the beginning of construction or rehabilitation of such project caused by (1) the failure of the Secretary to process such project within a reasonable period of time; (2) any environmental review requirement; (3) any legal action affecting such project; or (4) any other factor beyond the control of the public housing agency.</p>
