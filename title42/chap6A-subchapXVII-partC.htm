<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the provision of interim maintenance services in the State will not reduce the capacity of comprehensive treatment programs in the State to admit individuals to the programs (relative to the date on which such officer so certifies).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Date certain for issuance of regulations; failure of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall issue the final rule for purposes of the regulations required in paragraph (1), and such rule shall be effective, not later than the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on July 10, 1992.
