<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent amounts are made available for use under this section, the Director may, subject to the limitations of this section, provide financial assistance to States and communities that decide to participate in the pilot program established under this section for taking actions with respect to severe repetitive loss properties (as such term is defined in subsection (b) of this section) to mitigate flood damage to such properties and losses to the National Flood Insurance Fund from such properties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Severe repetitive loss property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;severe repetitive loss property&rdquo; has the following meaning:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has incurred flood-related damage&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for which 4 or more separate claims payments have been made under flood insurance coverage under this chapter, with the amount of each such claim exceeding $5,000, and with the cumulative amount of such claims payments exceeding $20,000; or</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), in any fiscal year the Director may not provide assistance under this section to a State or community in an amount exceeding 3 times the amount that the State or community certifies, as the Director shall require, that the State or community will contribute from non-<!-- PDFPage:4459 -->Federal funds for carrying out the eligible activities to be funded with such assistance amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduced community match</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to any 1-year period in which assistance is made available under this section, the Director may adjust the contribution required under paragraph (1) by any State, and for the communities located in that State, to not less than 10 percent of the cost of the activities for each severe repetitive loss property for which grant amounts are provided if, for such year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the State has an approved State mitigation plan meeting the requirements for hazard mitigation planning under section 5165 of this title that specifies how the State intends to reduce the number of severe repetitive loss properties; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Director determines, after consultation with the State, that the State has taken actions to reduce the number of such properties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-Federal funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;non-Federal funds&rdquo; includes State or local agency funds, in-kind contributions, any salary paid to staff to carry out the eligible activities of the recipient, the value of the time and services contributed by volunteers to carry out such activities (at a rate determined by the Director), and the value of any donated material or building and the value of any lease on a building.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that their property meets the definition of a severe repetitive loss property under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that they may receive an offer of assistance under this section;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the properties for which to provide assistance for eligible activities under subsection (c) of this section, the Director shall provide assistance for properties in the order that will result in the greatest amount of savings to the National Flood Insurance Fund in the shortest period of time, in a manner consistent with the allocation formula under paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall provide assistance in a manner that permits States and communities to make offers to owners of severe repetitive loss properties to take eligible activities under subsection (c) of this section as soon as practicable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining for which eligible activities under subsection (c) of this section to provide assistance with respect to a severe repetitive loss property, the relevant States and communities shall consult, to the extent practicable, with the owner of the property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Deference to local mitigation decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall not, by rule, regulation, or order, establish a priority for funding eligible activities under this section that gives preference to one type or category of eligible activity over any other type or category of eligible activity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Allocation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), of the total amount made available for assistance under this section in any fiscal year, the Director shall allocate assistance to a State, and the communities located within that State, based upon the percentage of the total number of severe repetitive loss properties located within that State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Redistribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any funds allocated to a State, and the communities within the State, under subparagraph (A) that have not been obligated by the end of each fiscal year shall be redistributed by the Director to other States and communities to carry out eligible activities in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) contain one or more severe repetitive loss properties; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are located in States that receive little or no assistance, as determined by the Director, under the allocation formula under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon making an offer to provide assistance with respect to a property for any eligible activity under subsection (c) of this section, the State or community shall notify each holder of a recorded interest on the property of such offer and activity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Purchase offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State or community may take action under subsection (c)(2) of this section to purchase a se<!-- PDFPage:4460 -->vere repetitive loss property only if the following requirements are met:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State or community enters into an agreement with the Director that provides assurances that the property purchased will be used in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of section 5170c(b)(2)(B) of this title for properties acquired, accepted, or from which a structure will be removed pursuant to a project provided property acquisition and relocation assistance under such section 5170c(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall provide assistance in a manner that permits States and communities to make offers to owners of severe repetitive loss properties and of associated land to engage in eligible activities as soon as possible.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Comparable housing payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a purchase offer made under paragraph (2) is less than the cost of the homeowner-occupant to purchase a comparable replacement dwelling outside the flood hazard area in the same community, the Director shall make available an additional relocation payment to the homeowner-occupant to apply to the difference.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Increased premiums in cases of refusal to mitigate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case in which the owner of a severe repetitive loss property refuses an offer to take action under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (c) of this section with respect to such property, the Director shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notify each holder of a recorded interest on the property of such refusal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notwithstanding subsections (a) through (c) of section 4015 of this title, thereafter the chargeable premium rate with respect to the property shall be the amount equal to 150 percent of the chargeable rate for the property at the time that the offer was made, as adjusted by any other premium adjustments otherwise applicable to the property and any subsequent increases pursuant to paragraph (2) and subject to the limitation under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Increased premiums upon subsequent flood damage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (c) of section 4015 of this title, if the owner of a severe repetitive loss property does not accept an offer to take action under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (c) of this section with respect to such property and a claim payment exceeding $1,500 is made under flood insurance coverage under this chapter for damage to the property caused by a flood event occurring after such offer is made, thereafter the chargeable premium rate with respect to the property shall be the amount equal to 150 percent of the chargeable rate for the property at the time of such flood event, as adjusted by any other premium adjustments otherwise applicable to the property and any subsequent increases pursuant to this paragraph and subject to the limitation under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation on increased premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In no case may the chargeable premium rate for a severe repetitive loss property be increased pursuant to this subsection to an amount exceeding the applicable estimated risk premium rate for the area (or subdivision thereof) under section 4014(a)(1) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any owner of a severe repetitive loss property may appeal a determination of the Director to take action under paragraph (1)(B) or (2) with respect to such property, based only upon the following grounds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) As a result of such action, the owner of the property will not be able to purchase a replacement primary residence of comparable value and that is functionally equivalent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Based on independent information, such as contractor estimates or appraisals, the property owner believes that the price offered for purchasing the property is not an accurate estimation of the value of the property, or the amount of Federal funds offered for mitigation activities, when combined with funds from non-Federal sources, will not cover the actual cost of mitigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) As a result of such action, the preservation or maintenance of any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places will be interfered with, impaired, or disrupted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) The flooding that resulted in the flood insurance claims described in sub<!-- PDFPage:4461 -->section (b)(2) of this section for the property resulted from significant actions by a third party in violation of Federal, State, or local law, ordinance, or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) In purchasing the property, the owner relied upon flood insurance rate maps of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that were current at the time and did not indicate that the property was located in an area having special flood hazards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) The owner of the property, based on independent information, such as contractor estimates or other appraisals, demonstrates that an alternative eligible activity under subsection (c) of this section is at least as cost effective as the initial offer of assistance.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4104. Flood elevation determinations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Publication or notification of proposed flood elevation determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing projected flood elevations for land use purposes with respect to any community pursuant to section 4102 of this title, the Director shall first propose such determinations by publication for comment in the Federal Register, by direct notification to the chief executive officer of the community, and by publication in a prominent local newspaper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Publication of flood elevation determinations; appeal of owner or lessee to local government; scientific or technical knowledge or information as basis for appeal; modification of proposed determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall publish notification of flood elevation determinations in a prominent local newspaper at least twice during the ten-day period following notification to the local government. During the ninety-day period following the second publication, any owner or lessee of real property within the community who believes his property rights to be adversely affected by the Director's proposed determination may appeal such determination to the local government. The sole basis for such appeal shall be the possession of knowledge or information indicating that the elevations being proposed by the Director with respect to an identified area having special flood hazards are scientifically or technically incorrect, and the sole relief which shall be granted under the authority of this section in the event that such appeal is sustained in accordance with subsection (e) or (f) of this section is a modification of the Director's proposed determination accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appeals by private persons; submission of negativing or contradicting data to community; opinion of community respecting justification for appeal by community; transmission of individual appeals to Director; filing of community action with Director</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Appeals by private persons shall be made to the chief executive officer of the community, or to such agency as he shall publicly designate, and shall set forth the data that tend to negate or contradict the Director's finding in such form as the chief executive officer may specify. The community shall review and consolidate all such appeals and issue a written opinion stating whether the evidence presented is sufficient to justify an appeal on behalf of such persons by the community in its own name. Whether or not the community decides to appeal the Director's determination, copies of individual appeals shall be sent to the Director as they are received by the community, and the community's appeal or a copy of its decision not to appeal shall be filed with the Director not later than ninety days after the date of the second newspaper publication of the Director's notification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administrative review of appeals by private persons; modification of proposed determinations; decision of Director: form and distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event the Director does not receive an appeal from the community within the ninety days provided, he shall consolidate and review on their own merits, in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (e) of this section, the appeals filed within the community by private persons and shall make such modifications of his proposed determinations as may be appropriate, taking into account the written opinion, if any, issued by the community in not supporting such appeals. The Director's decision shall be in written form, and copies thereof shall <!-- PDFPage:4463 -->be sent both to the chief executive officer of the community and to each individual appellant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Administrative review of appeals by community; agencies for resolution of conflicting data; availability of flood insurance pending such resolution; time for determination of Director; community adoption of local land use and control measures within reasonable time of final determination; public inspection and admissibility in evidence of reports and other administrative information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon appeal by any community, as provided by this section, the Director shall review and take fully into account any technical or scientific data submitted by the community that tend to negate or contradict the information upon which his proposed determination is based. The Director shall resolve such appeal by consultation with officials of the local government involved, by administrative hearing, or by submission of the conflicting data to an independent scientific body or appropriate Federal agency for advice. Until the conflict in data is resolved, and the Director makes a final determination on the basis of his findings in the Federal Register, and so notifies the governing body of the community, flood insurance previously available within the community shall continue to be available, and no person shall be denied the right to purchase such insurance at chargeable rates. The Director shall make his determination within a reasonable time. The community shall be given a reasonable time after the Director's final determination in which to adopt local land use and control measures consistent with the Director's determination. The reports and other information used by the Director in making his final determination shall be made available for public inspection and shall be admissible in a court of law in the event the community seeks judicial review as provided by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reimbursement of certain expenses; appropriation authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When, incident to any appeal under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the owner or lessee of real property or the community, as the case may be, incurs expense in connection with the services of surveyors, engineers, or similar services, but not including legal services, in the effecting of an appeal which is successful in whole or part, the Director shall reimburse such individual or community to an extent measured by the ratio of the successful portion of the appeal as compared to the entire appeal and applying such ratio to the reasonable value of all such services, but no reimbursement shall be made by the Director in respect to any fee or expense payment, the payment of which was agreed to be contingent upon the result of the appeal. There is authorized to be appropriated for purposes of implementing this subsection, not to exceed $250,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Judicial review of final administrative determinations; venue; time for appeal; scope of review; good cause for stay of final determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any appellant aggrieved by any final determination of the Director upon administrative appeal, as provided by this section, may appeal such determination to the United States district court for the district within which the community is located not more than sixty days after receipt of notice of such determination. The scope of review by the court shall be as provided by chapter 7 of title 5. During the pendency of any such litigation, all final determinations of the Director shall be effective for the purposes of this chapter unless stayed by the court for good cause shown.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director, in consultation with representatives of the mortgage and lending industry, the Federal entities for lending regulation, the Federal agency lenders, and any other appropriate individuals, shall develop a standard form for determining, in the case of a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home, whether the building or mobile home is located in an area identified by the Director as an area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance under this chapter is available. The form shall be established by regulations issued not later than 270 days after September 23, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Design and contents</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The form under subsection (a) of this section shall be designed to facilitate compliance with the flood insurance purchase requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The form shall require identification of the type of flood-risk zone in which the building <!-- PDFPage:4465 -->or mobile home is located, the complete map and panel numbers for the improved real estate or property on which the mobile home is located, the community identification number and community participation status (for purposes of the national flood insurance program) of the community in which the improved real estate or such property is located, and the date of the map used for the determination, with respect to flood hazard information on file with the Director. If the building or mobile home is not located in an area having special flood hazards the form shall require a statement to such effect and shall indicate the complete map and panel numbers of the improved real estate or property on which the mobile home is located. If the complete map and panel numbers are not available because the building or mobile home is not located in a community that is participating in the national flood insurance program or because no map exists for the relevant area, the form shall require a statement to such effect. The form shall provide for inclusion or attachment of any relevant documents indicating revisions or amendments to maps.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Required use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal entities for lending regulation shall by regulation require the use of the form under this section by regulated lending institutions. Each Federal agency lender shall by regulation provide for the use of the form with respect to any loan made by such Federal agency lender. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Government National Mortgage Association shall require the use of the form with respect to any loan purchased by such entities. A lender or other person may comply with the requirement under this subsection by using the form in a printed, computerized, or electronic manner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantees regarding information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing information regarding special flood hazards on the form developed under this section, any lender (or other person required to use the form) who makes, increases, extends, or renews a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home may provide for the acquisition or determination of such information to be made by a person other than such lender (or other person), only to the extent such person guarantees the accuracy of the information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reliance on previous determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person increasing, extending, renewing, or purchasing a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home may rely on a previous determination of whether the building or mobile home is located in an area having special flood hazards (and shall not be liable for any error in such previous determination), if the previous determination was made not more than 7 years before the date of the transaction and the basis for the previous determination has been set forth on a form under this section, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) map revisions or updates pursuant to section 4101(f) of this title after such previous determination have resulted in the building or mobile home being located in an area having special flood hazards; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person contacts the Director to determine when the most recent map revisions or updates affecting such property occurred and such revisions and updates have occurred after such previous determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The regulations under this section requiring use of the form established pursuant to this section shall be issued together with the regulations required under subsection (a) of this section and shall take effect upon the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on such issuance.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initial notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than six months following December 31, 1973, the Director shall publish information in accordance with section 4101(1) of this title, and shall notify the chief executive officer of each known flood-prone community not already participating in the national flood insurance program of its tentative identification as a community containing one or more areas having special flood hazards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Alternative actions of tentatively identified communities; public hearing; opportunity for submission of evidence; finality of administrative determination of existence or extent of flood hazard area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After such notification, each tentatively identified community shall either (1) promptly make proper application to participate in the national flood insurance program or (2) within six months submit technical data sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the Director that the community either is not seriously flood <!-- PDFPage:4469 -->prone or that such flood hazards as may have existed have been corrected by flood-works or other flood control methods. The Director may, in his discretion, grant a public hearing to any community with respect to which conflicting data exist as to the nature and extent of a flood hazard. If the Director decides not to hold a hearing, the community shall be given an opportunity to submit written and documentary evidence. Whether or not such hearing is granted, the Director's final determination as to the existence or extent of a flood hazard area in a particular community shall be deemed conclusive for the purposes of this Act if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Subsequent notification to additional communities known to be flood prone areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As information becomes available to the Director concerning the existence of flood hazards in communities not known to be flood prone at the time of the initial notification provided for by subsection (a) of this section he shall provide similar notifications to the chief executive officers of such additional communities, which shall then be subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Provisions of section 4106 applicable to flood-prone communities disqualified for flood insurance program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Formally identified flood-prone communities that do not qualify for the national flood insurance program within one year after such notification or by the date specified in section 4106 of this title, whichever is later, shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of that section relating to flood-prone communities which are not participating in the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Administrative procedures; establishment; reimbursement of certain expenses; appropriation authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director is authorized to establish administrative procedures whereby the identification under this section of one or more areas in the community as having special flood hazards may be appealed to the Director by the community or any owner or lessee of real property within the community who believes his property has been inadvertently included in a special flood hazard area by the identification. When, incident to any appeal under this subsection, the owner or lessee of real property or the community, as the case may be, incurs expense in connection with the services of surveyors, engineers, or similar services, but not including legal services, in the effecting of an appeal which is successful in whole or part, the Director shall reimburse such individual or community to an extent measured by the ratio of the successful portion of the appeal as compared to the entire appeal and applying such ratio to the reasonable value of all such services, but no reimbursement shall be made by the Director in respect to any fee or expense payment, the payment of which was agreed to be contingent upon the result of the appeal. There is authorized to be appropriated for purposes of implementing this subsection not to exceed $250,000.</p>
