<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of pilot projects by States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to develop and demonstrate ways of improving the delivery of services to individuals and families who need them under the various human services programs, by eliminating programmatic fragmentation and thereby assuring that an applicant for services under any one such program will be informed of and have access to all of the services which may be available to him or his family under the other human services programs being carried out in the community involved, any State having an approved plan under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter may, subject to the provisions of this section, establish and conduct one or more pilot projects to demonstrate the use of integrated service delivery systems for human services programs in that State or in one or more political subdivisions thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Integration of service delivery systems for human services programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The integration of service delivery systems for human services programs in any State or locality under a pilot project established under this section shall involve or include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the development of a common set of terms for use in all of the human services programs involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the development for each applicant of a single comprehensive family profile which is suitable for use under all of the human services programs involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the establishment and maintenance of a single resources directory by which the citizens of the community involved may be informed of and gain access to the services which are available under all such programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the development of a unified budget and budgeting process, and a unified accounting system, with standardized audit procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the implementation of unified planning, needs assessment, and evaluation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the consolidation of agency locations and related transportation services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the standardization of procedures for purchasing services from nongovernmental sources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the creation of communications linkages among agencies to permit the serving of individual and family needs across program and agency lines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the development, to the maximum extent possible, of uniform application and eligibility determination procedures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) any other methods, arrangements, and procedures which the Secretary determines are necessary or desirable for, and consistent with, the establishment and operation of an integrated service delivery system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Procedures for State establishment of pilot projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any State which desires to establish and conduct a pilot project under this section, after having published a description of the proposed project and invited comments thereon from interested persons in the community or communities which would be affected, shall submit an application to the Secretary (in such form and containing such information as the Secretary may require) within 6 months after July 18, 1984. The proposed project may be statewide in operation or may be limited to one or more political subdivisions of the State; and the application shall in any event include or be accompanied by satisfactory assurances that the project as proposed would be permitted under applicable State and local law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall consider all applications and accompanying comments and materials which are submitted under paragraph (1), and, no later than 9 months after July 18, 1984, shall approve no fewer than 3 nor more than 5 of the proposed projects (including one such project to be operated on a statewide basis). In considering and approving such applications the Secretary shall take into account the size and characteristics of the population that would be served by each proposed project, the desirability of wide geographic distribution among the projects, the number and nature of the human services programs which are in active operation in the various communities involved, and such other factors as may tend to indicate whether or not a particular proposed project would provide a useful and effective demonstration of the value of an integrated service delivery system. Each project approved under this paragraph shall be deemed for purposes of this section to begin on the first day of the month following the month in which the application with respect to such project is approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall approve any application for a project under this section only after determining that the conduct of such project will not lower or restrict the levels of aid, assistance, benefits, or services, or the income or resource standards, deductions, or exclusions, under any of the human services programs involved, and will not delay the provision of aid, assistance, benefits, or services under any of such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requests by States for waiver of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any State whose application is approved under subsection (c) of this section may submit to the Secretary a request for the waiver of any requirement which would otherwise apply with respect to the proposed project under any of the laws governing the human services programs to be included in the project; and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the law involved is within the jurisdiction of the Secretary and authority to grant the waiver involved is otherwise available to the Secretary under this subchapter, subchapter IV of this chapter, or any other provision of law, the Secretary shall approve such request upon a determination that the waiver is necessary for the project to provide a useful and effective demonstration of the value of an integrated service delivery system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the law involved is within the jurisdiction of a Federal agency other than the Department of Health and Human Services and authority to grant the waiver involved is available to the head of such other agency under that law or any other provision of law, <!-- PDFPage:1422 -->the Secretary shall transmit such request (on behalf of the requesting State) to the head of such other agency, who shall approve such request upon a determination that the waiver is necessary for the project to provide a useful and effective demonstration of the value of an integrated service delivery system and who shall certify such approval to the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If under the law governing any of the human services programs included within a project there are provisions establishing safeguards which limit or restrict the use or disclosure of information (concerning applicants for or recipients of benefits or services) which has been obtained or developed by the agency involved in the conduct of that program, and a waiver of such provisions is granted under paragraph (1) in order to make such information available for purposes of the project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State shall provide each applicant for and recipient of aid, assistance, benefits, or services under the proposed integrated service delivery system with a clear and readily comprehensible notice that such information may be disclosed to and used by project personnel, or exchanged with the other agencies having responsibility for human services programs included within the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State shall take such steps as may be necessary to ensure that the information disclosed will be used only for purposes of, and by persons directly connected with, such project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the State's application with respect to the project under subsection (c) of this section shall contain or be accompanied by satisfactory assurances that the preceding requirements of this paragraph will be fully complied with.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payments to States by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall from time to time pay to each State which has an approved pilot project under this section, in such manner and according to such schedule as may be agreed upon by the Secretary and such State, amounts equal in the aggregate to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 90 percent of the costs incurred by such State and its political subdivisions in carrying out such project during the first 18 months after the date on which the project begins,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 80 percent of any such costs incurred during the 12-month period beginning with the nineteenth month after such date, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) 70 percent of any such costs incurred during the 12-month period beginning with the thirty-first month after such date.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Human services program&rdquo; defined; consultation by Secretary with other department heads</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;human services program&rdquo; includes the program of aid to families with dependent children under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter, the supplemental security income benefits program under subchapter XVI of this chapter, the Federal food stamp program, and any other Federal or federally assisted program (other than a program under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. 701 et seq.]) which provides aid, assistance, or benefits based wholly or partly on need or on income-related qualifications to specified classes or types of individuals or families or which is designed to help in crisis or emergency situations by meeting the basic human needs of individuals or families whose own resources are insufficient for that purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out this section the Secretary shall regularly consult with the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and the head of any other Federal agency having jurisdiction over or responsibility for one or more human services programs, in order to ensure that the administrative efforts of the various agencies involved are coordinated with respect to all of the pilot projects being carried out under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reports by States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require each State which is carrying out a pilot project under this section to submit periodic reports on the progress of such project, giving particular attention to the cost-effectiveness of the integrated service delivery system involved and the extent to which such system is improving the delivery of services. No pilot project under this section shall be conducted for a period of longer than 42 months. The first such report shall be submitted no later than 3 months after the date on which the project begins.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Report to Congress by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall from time to time submit to the Congress a report on the progress and current status of each of the approved pilot projects under this section. Each such report shall reflect the periodic reports theretofore submitted to the Secretary by the States involved under subsection (g) of this section, and shall contain such additional comments, findings, and recommendations with respect to the operation of the program under this section as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Study of program by Comptroller General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Comptroller General shall, at such time or times as he determines to be appropriate, review and evaluate any or all of the pilot projects undertaken pursuant to this section, and shall from time to time report to the Congress on the results of such reviews and evaluations together with his findings and recommendations with respect thereto.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated, for the four-fiscal-year period beginning with the fiscal year 1985, such sums, not to exceed $8,000,000 in the aggregate, as may be necessary to carry out this section.</p>
