<p class="statutory-body">It shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employment agency to fail or refuse to refer for employment, or otherwise to discriminate against, any individual because of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, or to classify or refer for employment any individual on the basis of his race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Businesses or enterprises with personnel qualified on basis of religion, sex, or national origin; educational institutions with personnel of particular religion</h4>

It shall not be an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter for any employer to differentiate upon the basis of sex in determining the amount of the wages or compensation paid or to be paid to employees of such employer if such differentiation is authorized by the provisions of section 206(d) of title 29.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Preferential treatment not to be granted on account of existing number or percentage imbalance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing contained in this subchapter shall be interpreted to require any employer, employment agency, labor organization, or joint labor-management committee subject to this subchapter to grant preferential treatment to any individual or to any group because of the race, <!-- PDFPage:3657 -->color, religion, sex, or national origin of such individual or group on account of an imbalance which may exist with respect to the total number or percentage of persons of any race, color, religion, sex, or national origin employed by any employer, referred or classified for employment by any employment agency or labor organization, admitted to membership or classified by any labor organization, or admitted to, or employed in, any apprenticeship or other training program, in comparison with the total number or percentage of persons of such race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in any community, State, section, or other area, or in the available work force in any community, State, section, or other area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Burden of proof in disparate impact cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) An unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is established under this subchapter only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a complaining party demonstrates that a respondent uses a particular employment practice that causes a disparate impact on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin and the respondent fails to demonstrate that the challenged practice is job related for the position in question and consistent with business necessity; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the complaining party makes the demonstration described in subparagraph (C) with respect to an alternative employment practice and the respondent refuses to adopt such alternative employment practice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) With respect to demonstrating that a particular employment practice causes a disparate impact as described in subparagraph (A)(i), the complaining party shall demonstrate that each particular challenged employment practice causes a disparate impact, except that if the complaining party can demonstrate to the court that the elements of a respondent's decisionmaking process are not capable of separation for analysis, the decisionmaking process may be analyzed as one employment practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the respondent demonstrates that a specific employment practice does not cause the disparate impact, the respondent shall not be required to demonstrate that such practice is required by business necessity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The demonstration referred to by subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be in accordance with the law as it existed on June 4, 1989, with respect to the concept of &ldquo;alternative employment practice&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A demonstration that an employment practice is required by business necessity may not be used as a defense against a claim of intentional discrimination under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, a rule barring the employment of an individual who currently and knowingly uses or possesses a controlled substance, as defined in schedules I and II of section 102(6) of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802(6)), other than the use or possession of a drug taken under the supervision of a licensed health care professional, or any other use or possession authorized by the Controlled Substances Act [21 U.S.C. 801 et seq.] or any other provision of Federal law, shall be considered an unlawful employment practice under this subchapter only if such rule is adopted or applied with an intent to discriminate because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Prohibition of discriminatory use of test scores</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be an unlawful employment practice for a respondent, in connection with the selection or referral of applicants or candidates for employment or promotion, to adjust the scores of, use different cutoff scores for, or otherwise alter the results of, employment related tests on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Impermissible consideration of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin in employment practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in this subchapter, an unlawful employment practice is established when the complaining party demonstrates that race, color, religion, sex, or national origin was a motivating factor for any employment practice, even though other factors also motivated the practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Resolution of challenges to employment practices implementing litigated or consent judgments or orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, and except as provided in paragraph (2), an employment practice that implements and is within the scope of a litigated or consent judgment or order that resolves a claim of employment discrimination under the Constitution or Federal civil rights laws may not be challenged under the circumstances described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A practice described in subparagraph (A) may not be challenged in a claim under the Constitution or Federal civil rights laws&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) by a person who, prior to the entry of the judgment or order described in subparagraph (A), had&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) actual notice of the proposed judgment or order sufficient to apprise such person that such judgment or order might adversely affect the interests and legal rights of such person and that an opportunity was available to present objections to such judgment or order by a future date certain; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) a reasonable opportunity to present objections to such judgment or order; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) by a person whose interests were adequately represented by another person who had previously challenged the judgment or order on the same legal grounds and with a similar factual situation, unless there has been an intervening change in law or fact.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) alter the standards for intervention under rule 24 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or apply to the rights of parties who have successfully intervened pursuant to such rule in the proceeding in which the parties intervened;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) apply to the rights of parties to the action in which a litigated or consent judgment or order was entered, or of members of a class represented or sought to be represented in <!-- PDFPage:3658 -->such action, or of members of a group on whose behalf relief was sought in such action by the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) prevent challenges to a litigated or consent judgment or order on the ground that such judgment or order was obtained through collusion or fraud, or is transparently invalid or was entered by a court lacking subject matter jurisdiction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) authorize or permit the denial to any person of the due process of law required by the Constitution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any action not precluded under this subsection that challenges an employment consent judgment or order described in paragraph (1) shall be brought in the court, and if possible before the judge, that entered such judgment or order.
