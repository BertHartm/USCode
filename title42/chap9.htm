<p class="statutory-body">(a) Projects may be initiated under this subchapter by the Department of the Navy or Army or the Air Force to provide dwellings on or near naval or military reservations, posts or bases for rental to the officers, enlisted men and employees of the Departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force described in section 1501 of this title. Such projects shall be developed by the Department of the Navy or Army or the Air Force or by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, whichever the President determines is better suited to the fulfillment of the purposes of this subchapter with respect to any particular project. If the development of such project is to be undertaken by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to aid the development of the project by furnishing technical assistance and by transferring to such Department the funds necessary for the development of the project. Any project developed for the purpose of this section shall be leased to the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (who shall have title to such project until repayment of the cost thereof to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as prescribed in such lease) upon such terms as shall be prescribed in the lease, which may be the same terms as are authorized by the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], with respect to leases to public housing agencies. All the provisions of said Act which apply to the development of projects by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall (insofar as applicable and not inconsistent herewith) apply to the development of projects by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force. Notwithstanding other provisions of this or any other law, the Department leasing a project shall have the same jurisdiction over such project as it has over the reservation, post or base in connection with which the project is developed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force, in connection with any project developed or leased by it, and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in connection with any project developed or assisted by him, for the purposes of this subchapter, may acquire real or personal property or any interest therein by purchase, eminent domain, gift, lease or otherwise. The provisions of section 255 of title 40 shall not apply to the acquisition of any real property by the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force or by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for the purposes of this subchapter or to the project developed thereon, and the provisions of section 303b of title 40, shall not apply to any lease of any project developed for the purposes of this subchapter or of any dwelling therein. Condemnation proceedings instituted by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be in the Secretary's own name and the practice and procedure governing such proceedings by the United States shall be followed, and the Sec<!-- PDFPage:2988 -->retary of Housing and Urban Development shall likewise be entitled to proceed in accordance with the provisions of sections 258a to 258e&ndash;1 and 361 to 386&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1502_1_target" name="1502_1">1</a></sup> of title 40. If the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development acquires land in connection with a project to be assisted for the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary may convey such land to the public housing agency involved for a consideration equal to the cost of the land to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. The Departments of the Navy, Army, and Air Force and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may negotiate, contract and fix such fees as they determine are reasonable for the services of architects, engineers, surveyors, appraisers, title examiners and real estate negotiators in connection with specific projects developed by them under this subchapter. The Secretaries of Navy, Army, and Air Force are authorized to make available to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development any land that is needed for a project to be developed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and leased to the Department of the Navy or Army or Air Force and to execute such leases, agreements and other instruments with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development as may be necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter.</p>

The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall act as promptly as practicable on any request which complies with the provisions of this section and is supported as herein required, and shall as <!-- PDFPage:2999 -->promptly as practicable arrange for the making of any survey or the performance of other work necessary to the transfer: <em>Provided</em>, That, notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may at any time, except with respect to housing for which a request has been or may be submitted under subsection (a) of this section, remove, dispose of, or retain any temporary housing, or part thereof, in accordance with any provision of subchapters II to VII of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Representations by transferee as to use of property; preferences</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No relinquishment or transfer with respect to temporary housing shall be made under this section unless the transferee represents in its request therefor that it proposes, to the extent permitted by law:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) As among eligible applicants for occupancy in dwellings of given sizes and at specified rents, to extend the following preferences in the selection of tenants:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">First, to families which are to be displaced by any low-rent housing project or by any public slum-clearance or redevelopment project initiated after January 1, 1947, or which were so displaced within three years prior to making application for admission to such housing; and as among such families first preference shall be given to families of disabled veterans whose disability has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected, and second preference shall be given to families of deceased veterans and servicemen whose death has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected, and third preference shall be given to families of other veterans and servicemen;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Second, to families of other veterans and servicemen; and as among such families first preference shall be given to families of disabled veterans whose disability has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected, and second preference shall be given to families of deceased veterans and servicemen whose death has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected: <em>Provided</em>, That if the transferee is an educational institution it may limit such preferences to student veterans and servicemen, and their families, and may, in lieu of such preferences, make available to veterans or servicemen and their families accommodations in any housing of the institution equal in number to the accommodations relinquished or transferred to it: <em>And provided further</em>, That, notwithstanding such preferences, if the transferee is a State, political subdivision, local housing authority, or local public agency, it will, in filling vacancies in housing transferred under subsection (b) of this section, give such preferences to military personnel and persons engaged in national defense or mobilization activities as the Secretary of Defense or his designee prescribes to such transferee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Not to dispose of any right, title, or interest in the property (by sale, transfer, grant, exchange, mortgage, lease, release, termination of the leasehold, or any other relinquishment of interest) either (i) for housing use on the present site or on any other site except to a State or political subdivision thereof, local housing authority, a local public agency, or an educational or eleemosynary institution, or (ii) for any other use unless the governing body of the municipality or county shall have adopted a resolution determining that, on the basis of local need and acceptability, the structures involved are satisfactory for such use and need not be removed: <em>Provided</em>, That this representation will not apply to any disposal through demolition for salvage, lease to tenants for residential occupancy, or lease of nondwelling facilities for the continuance of a use existing on the date of transfer, or where such disposal is the result of a bona fide foreclosure or other proceeding to enforce rights given as security for a loan to pay for land under this section: <em>And provided further</em>, That nothing contained in this paragraph shall be construed as applicable to the disposition of any land or interest therein after the removal of the structures therefrom.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To manage and operate the property involved in accordance with sound business practices, including the establishment of adequate reserves.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Whenever the structures involved, or a substantial portion thereof, are terminated for housing use and are not to be used for a specific nonhousing use, to promptly demolish such structures terminated for housing use and clear the site thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of removal requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any relinquishment or transfer by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under this section shall constitute a waiver of the requirements of section 1553 of this title (and any contractual obligations pursuant thereto) for removing the housing involved if the request for such relinquishment or transfer was made, as authorized herein, by the governing body of the municipality or county, or by the local housing authority, or, in other cases, if, prior to or within six months after the date of the relinquishment or transfer, there is filed with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development a resolution of such governing body specifically approving (1) the unconditional waiver of such requirements or (2) the waiver of such requirements subject to conditions specified in the resolution. Any such conditions shall not affect the waiver of removal requirements hereunder, and the United States shall assume no responsibility for compliance therewith.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Disposition of net revenue and proceeds; transfer charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any relinquishment or transfer under this section, the net revenues and other proceeds from such housing to which the United States is entitled on the basis of periodic settlements shall continue to accrue to the United States until the end of the month in which the relinquishment or transfer is made, and the obligation of the transferee to pay such accrued amounts shall not be affected by this section. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Develop<!-- PDFPage:3000 -->ment may charge to the transferee the cost to the United States of any survey, title information, or other item incidental to the transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Transfers for slum clearance and community redevelopment projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of a request therefor as herein prescribed, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may (subject to the provisions of this section) relinquish and transfer, without monetary consideration other than payment for land involved as specifically required by subsection (b) of this section, to any local public agency organized specifically and solely for the purpose of slum clearance and community redevelopment in a municipality in which the total number of persons, who on December 31, 1948, were living in temporary family accommodations provided by the United States or any agency thereof since September 8, 1939, exceeded the total population of such municipality as shown by the 1940 census, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and with respect to any temporary housing located in such municipality under the conditions set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall not relinquish or transfer any right, title, or interest of the United States in and with respect to any temporary housing situated in such a municipality except as set forth in this subsection if at the time of the relinquishment or transfer there is in existence in such a municipality a local public agency organized specifically and solely for the purpose of slum clearance and community redevelopment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Transfers of temporary housing of masonry construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the filing of a request therefor as herein prescribed, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may (subject to the provisions of this section except the provisions of subsection (d) of this section) relinquish and transfer to any municipality, without monetary consideration other than payment for the land involved as specifically required by subsection (b) of this section, all right, title, and interest of the United States in and with respect to unoccupied temporary housing of masonry construction located in such municipality: <em>Provided</em>, That such housing has been wholly or partially stripped of trim and fixtures prior to April 20, 1950 and the municipality adopts a resolution determining that the structures, with proposed improvements, will be suitable for long-term housing use.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Lease, condemnation or purchase; temporary housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may continue by lease or condemnation any interest less than a fee simple in lands heretofore acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development for national defense or war housing or for veterans&rsquo; housing (whether of permanent or temporary character), or held by any Federal agency in connection therewith, and may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, a fee simple title to or lesser interest in any such lands if the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that the acquisition of such fee simple or lesser interest is necessary to protect the Government's investment or to maintain the improvements constructed thereon, or that the cost of fulfilling the Government's obligation to restore the property to its original condition would equal or exceed the cost of acquiring the title thereto.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">In any city in which, on March 1, 1953, there were more than ten thousand temporary housing units held by the United States of America, or any two contiguous cities in one of which there were on such date more than ten thousand temporary housing units so held, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may acquire, by purchase or condemnation, a fee simple title to any or all lands in which the Secretary holds a leasehold interest, or other interest less than a fee simple, acquired by the Federal Government for national defense or war housing or for veteran's housing where (1) the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development finds that the acquisition by the Secretary of a fee simple title in the land will tend to expedite the orderly disposal or removal of temporary housing under the Secretary's jurisdiction by facilitating the availability of improved sites for privately owned housing needed to replace such temporary housing, and will tend to expedite the transition of the city from a war-affected community containing, as of said date, a large number of temporary houses to a community having additional permanent, well-planned, residential neighborhoods, (2) the local governing body of the city makes a like finding and requests the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to acquire such title to the land, and (3) the city has furnished assurances satisfactory to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that no individual who is employed by, or is an official of, the government of the city in which the land is located, or any agency thereof, shall be permitted, directly or indirectly, to have any financial interest in the purchase or redevelopment of such land: <em>Provided</em>, That such acquisitions by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this sentence shall be limited to not exceeding four hundred and twenty-five acres of land in the general area in which approximately one thousand five hundred units of temporary housing held by the United States of America were unoccupied on said date: <em>And provided further</em>, That funds for such acquisition by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, which are authorized, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section and title II of the Independent Offices Appropriation Act, 1955, to be expended from the revolving fund established by section 1701g&ndash;5 of title 12, shall be taken into consideration, to the extent that they are needed, in making any determination pursuant to the second proviso under that section. All or any <!-- PDFPage:3003 -->part of any land so acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, during the five year period following the date of its acquisition, be sold by the Secretary, through negotiated sale, to such city or any local public agency where (1) the city or local public agency has represented to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development that it is duly authorized under State law to purchase and resell such land, that such land will be made available to private enterprise for development in accordance with local zoning and other laws, and that the aggregate of such land and any other land in the same city previously sold under the authority of this paragraph to the city or a local public agency will be developed for predominantly residential use, and (2) the city or local public agency has agreed to pay the fair market value of the land as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, after giving consideration, among other relevant information, to the cost to the Federal Government of acquiring the fee simple title and of holding the land pending sale (including estimated amounts to cover legal and overhead expenses of such acquisition and to cover interest costs to the Federal Government of monies invested in the land pending sale). Any such negotiated sale of land to the city or a local public agency shall be made upon terms which require (1) that the city or public agency shall pay in cash at least one third of the price of the land upon its conveyance and the entire price within one year after its conveyance and (2) that any portion of the entire price not paid upon such conveyance shall be represented by an indebtedness which shall bear interest on outstanding balances at a rate of 4 per centum per annum and which shall be secured by a first mortgage lien upon the land or such portion of the land as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development deems adequate to protect the financial interest of the Federal Government. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may, at any time that the Secretary deems it to be in the public interest to do so, dispose, under authority of other provisions of subchapters II to VII of this chapter, of any land acquired by the Secretary pursuant to this paragraph. Any land acquired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this paragraph which has not been disposed of within five years after its acquisition shall be disposed of by the Secretary as expeditiously as possible in the public interest in accordance with other authority contained in subchapters II to VII of this chapter. Notwithstanding the provisions of section 1546 of this title or any other provisions of law, no payments in lieu of taxes shall be made for any tax year beginning subsequent to the date of the acquisition of title to the property by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Land rentals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development holds, on or after April 1, 1950, an interest in land acquired by the Federal Government for national defense, war housing, or veterans&rsquo; housing and where (1) the term of such interest (as prescribed in the taking or in the lease or other instruments) is for the &ldquo;duration of the emergency&rdquo; or &ldquo;duration of the war&rdquo;, or &ldquo;duration of the emergency&rdquo; or &ldquo;duration of the war&rdquo; plus a specific period thereafter, or for some similarly prescribed term, and (2) the rental, award, or other consideration which the Federal Government is obligated to pay or furnish for such interest gives the owner of the land less than an annual return, after payment of real estate taxes, of 6 per centum of the lowest value placed on such land by an independent appraiser, hired by the Government to make such appraisal based on the value of the land before the acquisition of the Government's interest therein, plus 100 per centum of such value, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall, upon request of the owner of the land and, notwithstanding any existing contractual or other rights or obligations, increase the amount of future payments for such interest in order to give the owner of the land a return for the Government's use thereof not exceeding the 6 per centum annual return described in (2) of this subsection: <em>Provided</em>, That this subsection shall not affect any payment heretofore made or any future payment accepted by an obligee, nor shall this subsection limit the consideration which may be paid for the use of any land beyond the existing term of the Government's interest therein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reserve account; availability of moneys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provisions of law unless hereafter enacted expressly in limitation hereof, moneys shall be deposited in the reserve account established pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of section 1543 of this title (which account is continued subject to the limitation as to amount specified in subsection (c) of section 1543 of this title) and all moneys deposited in such reserve account shall be and remain available for any or all of the purposes specified in said subsections (a) or (b) of section 1543 of this title or in this section without regard to the time prescribed in subsection (c) of section 1543 of this title with respect to covering moneys in such account into miscellaneous receipts. Moneys in such reserve accounts shall also be available for the payment of necessary expenses (which shall be considered nonadministrative expenses) in connection with administering (1) transfers pursuant to section 1581 of this title, (2) redeterminations of the temporary or permanent character of demountable housing pursuant to section 1583 of this title, (3) changes in land tenure and revisions in the consideration payable to landowners pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) of this section, and (4) transfers of permanent war housing for low-rent use pursuant to section 1586 of this title. Moneys in such reserve account shall also be available for the purpose of making improvements to, or alterations of, any permanent housing or part thereof if (1) the dwelling structures therein are designed for occupancy by not more than four families and are to be sold separately and (2) such improvement or alteration is requested by the local governing body as a condition to the acceptance of the dedication of streets or utilities or is necessary for compliance with local law or regulation relating to the continued operation or occupancy of the housing by a purchaser.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In addition to the authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under the first sentence of this subsection, the Secretary is specifically authorized to convey any permanent war housing project to a local public housing agency if requested in writing, within sixty days after April 20, 1950, by such agency or the executive head of the municipality (or of the county or parish if such project is not in a municipality) within which the project is located, or by the Governor of the State where an agency of the State has authority to operate the project: <em>Provided</em>, That any conveyance by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this sentence shall be subject to the same conditions and requirements as provided in this section with respect to a project specifically designated herein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Projects as &ldquo;low-rent housing&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the conveyance by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of any such project pursuant to the provisions of this section, such project shall constitute and be deemed to be &ldquo;low-rent housing&rdquo; as that term is used and defined in the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] (and to be a low-rent housing project assisted pursuant to that Act, within the meaning of section 1404a(b) <!-- PDFPage:3006 -->of this title). Any instrument of conveyance by the Administrator stating that it is executed under subchapters II to VII of this chapter shall be conclusive evidence of compliance therewith insofar as any title or other interest in the property is concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conditions and requirements of agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agreement between the public housing agency and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development required by subsection (a) of this section shall contain the following conditions and requirements, and may contain such further conditions, requirements, and provisions as the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) during a period of forty years following the conveyance the project shall be administered as low-rent housing in accordance with subsections 2(1) and 2(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1402(1) and (2)]: <em>Provided</em>, That if at any time during such period the public housing agency and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development agree that the project, or any part thereof, is no longer suitable for use as low-rent housing, the project, or part thereof, shall with the approval of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development be sold by the public housing agency after which the agreement shall be deemed to have terminated with respect to such project or part thereof except that the proceeds from such sale, after payment of the reasonable expense thereof, shall be paid to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, or, with the Secretary's approval, used to finance the repair or rehabilitation of a project or part thereof conveyed to the public housing agency under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public housing agency shall, within six months following the conveyance, initiate a program for the removal of all families residing in the project on the date of conveyance who are ineligible under the provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.] for continued occupancy therein, and shall have required such ineligible tenants to vacate their dwellings within eighteen months after the initiation of such program: <em>Provided</em>, That military personnel as designated by the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall not be subject to such removal until eighteen months after the date of conveyance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) annually during the term of such agreement, the public housing agency shall pay to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development all income from the project remaining after deducting the amounts necessary (as determined pursuant to regulations of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) for (i) the payment of reasonable and proper costs of operating, maintaining, and approving such project, (ii) the payments in lieu of taxes authorized hereunder, (iii) the establishment and maintenance of reasonable and proper reserves as approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and (iv) the payment of currently maturing installments of principal of and interest on any indebtedness incurred by such public housing agency with the approval of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: <em>Provided</em>, That the provisions of this paragraph shall not be applicable to any project which is consolidated under a single contract with one or more low-rent projects being assisted under the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], and all income from any such project conveyed under this section may be commingled with funds of the project or projects with which it is consolidated and applied in accordance with the requirements of the consolidated contract and the provisions of section 10(c) of the said Act [42 U.S.C. 1410(c)];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) during the term of such agreement, the project shall be exempt from all real and personal property taxes levied or imposed by the State, city, county, or other political subdivisions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) for the tax year in which the conveyance is made and the next succeeding tax year annual payments in lieu of taxes may be made to the State, city, county, or other political subdivisions in amounts not in excess of the real property taxes which would be paid to such State, city, county, or other political subdivisions if the project were not exempt from taxation; and thereafter, during the term of such agreement, payments in lieu of taxes with respect to the project may be made in annual amounts which do not exceed 10 per centum of the annual shelter rents charged in such project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) in selecting tenants for such project, the public housing agency shall give such preferences as are prescribed by subsection 10(g) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1410g], except that for one year after the date of conveyance of a project, the public housing agency shall, to the extent permitted by law, give such preferences, by allocation or otherwise, to military personnel as the Secretary of Defense or his designee prescribes to the public housing agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) upon the occurrence of a substantial default in respect to the requirements and conditions to which the public housing agency is subject (as such substantial default shall be defined in such agreement), the public housing agency shall be obligated at the option of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, either to convey title in any case where, in the determination of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, (which determination shall be final and conclusive), such conveyance of title is necessary to achieve the purposes of this subchapter and the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437 et seq.], or to deliver possession to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of the project, as then constituted, to which such agreement relates: <em>Provided</em>, That in the event of such conveyance of title or delivery of possession, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may improve and administer such project as low-rent housing, and otherwise deal with such housing or parts thereof, subject, however, to the limitations contained in the applicable provisions of the United States Housing Act of 1937. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be obligated to reconvey or to redeliver possession of the project, as constituted at the <!-- PDFPage:3007 -->time of reconveyance or redelivery, to such public housing agency or to its successor (if such public housing agency or a successor exists) upon such terms as shall be prescribed in such agreement and as soon as practicable after the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall be satisfied that all defaults with respect to the project have been cured, and that the project will, in order to fulfill the purposes of this subchapter and the United States Housing Act of 1937, thereafter be operated in accordance with the terms of such agreement. Any prior conveyances and reconveyances, deliveries and redeliveries of possession shall not exhaust the right to require a conveyance or delivery of possession of the project to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to this paragraph upon the subsequent occurrence of a substantial default.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Disposition of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of each fiscal year, the total amount of payments during such year to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in accordance with subsection (c) of this section shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Veterans&rsquo; preference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any housing disposed of in accordance with this section shall after such disposal be deemed to be housing accommodations the construction of which was completed after June 30, 1947, within the meaning of section 1884 of Appendix to title 50, relating to preference or priority to veterans of World War II or their families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Terms of sales</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Disregard of preferences in certain cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may dispose of any permanent war housing without regard to the preferences in subsections (b) and (c) of this section when the Secretary determines that (1) such housing, because of design or lack of amenities, is unsuitable for family dwelling use, or (2) it is being used at the time of disposition for other than dwelling purposes, or (3) it was offered, with preferences substantially similar to those provided in the Housing Act of 1950, to veterans and occupants prior to April 20, 1950.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types, sales, preferences in purchases, and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consistent with other requirements of national defense, any permanent housing constructed pursuant to the authority of this subchapter shall consist of one- to four-family dwelling structures (including row houses) so ar<!-- PDFPage:3015 -->ranged that they may be offered for separate sale. All housing of permanent construction which is constructed or acquired under the authority of this subchapter shall be sold as expeditiously as possible and in the public interest taking into consideration the continuation of the need for such housing by persons engaged in national defense activities. All dwelling structures of permanent construction designed for occupancy by not more than four families (including row houses) shall be offered for sale, and preference in the purchase of any such dwelling structure shall be granted to occupants and to veterans over other prospective purchasers. As among veterans, preference in the purchase of any such dwelling structure shall be given to disabled veterans whose disability has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected. All dwelling structures of permanent construction in any housing project which are designed for occupancy by more than four families (and other structures in such project which are not sold separately) shall be sold as an entity. On such sales first preference shall be given for such period not less than ninety days nor more than six months from the date of the initial offering of such project as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may determine, to groups of veterans organized on a mutual ownership or cooperative basis (provided that any such group shall accept as a member of its organization, on the same terms, subject to the same conditions, and with the same privileges and responsibilities, required of, and extended to, other members of the group any tenant occupying a dwelling unit in such project, at any time during such period as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall deem appropriate, starting on the date of the announcement by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of the availability of such project). The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall provide an equitable method of selecting the purchasers when preferred purchasers (or groups of preferred purchasers) in the same preference class or containing members in the same preference class compete with each other. Sales pursuant to this section shall be for cash or credit, upon such terms as the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall determine, and at the fair value of the property as determined by the Secretary: <em>Provided</em>, That full payment to the Government for the property sold shall be required within a period of not exceeding twenty-five years with interest on unpaid balances at not less than 4 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Temporary housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where it is necessary to provide housing under this subchapter in locations where, in the determination of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, there appears to be no need for such housing beyond the period during which it is needed for housing persons engaged in national defense activities, the provisions of section 1591a of this title shall not be applicable and temporary housing which is of a mobile or portable character or which is otherwise constructed so as to be available for reuse at other locations or existing housing built or acquired by the United States under authority of any other law shall be provided. Any temporary housing constructed or acquired under this subchapter which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines to be no longer needed for use under this subchapter shall, unless transferred to the Department of Defense pursuant to section 1592e of this title, or reported as excess to the Administrator of the General Services Administration pursuant to the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [40 U.S.C. 471 et seq.], be sold as soon as practicable to the highest responsible bidder after public advertising, except that if one or more of such bidders is a veteran purchasing a dwelling unit for his own occupancy the sale of such unit shall be made to the highest responsible bidder who is a veteran so purchasing: <em>Provided</em>, That the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development may reject any bid for less than two-thirds of the appraised value as determined by him: <em>Provided further</em>, That the housing may be sold at fair value (as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) to a public body for public use: <em>And provided further</em>, That the housing structures shall be sold for removal from the site, except that they may be sold for use on the site if the governing body of the locality has adopted a resolution approving use of such structures on the site.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Preference in admission to occupancy pending ultimate disposition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development determines that any housing provided under this subchapter is no longer required for persons engaged in national defense activities, preference in admission to occupancy thereof shall be given to veterans pending its ultimate sale or disposition in accordance with the provisions of this subchapter. As among veterans, preference in admission to occupancy shall be given to disabled veterans whose disability has been determined by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to be service-connected.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">With respect to any housing or community facilities or services which the Secretary of Hous<!-- PDFPage:3017 -->ing and Urban Development is authorized to provide, or any property which he is authorized to acquire, under this Act, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized by contract or otherwise (without regard to section 5 of title 41, section 278a&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1592d_1_target" name="1592d_1">1</a></sup> of title 40, the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended [41 U.S.C. 251 et seq.], and prior to the approval of the Attorney General) to make plans, surveys, and investigations; to acquire (by purchase, donation, condemnation or otherwise), construct, erect, extend, remodel, operate, rent, lease, exchange, repair, deal with, insure, maintain, convey, sell for cash or credit, demolish, or otherwise dispose of any property, land, improvement, or interest therein; to provide approaches, utilities, and transportation facilities; to procure necessary materials, supplies, articles, equipment, and machinery; to make advance payments for leased property; to pursue to final disposition by way of compromise or otherwise, claims both for and against the United States (exclusive of claims in excess of $5,000 arising out of contracts for construction, repairs, and the purchase of supplies and materials, and claims involving administrative expenses) which are not in litigation and which have not been referred to the Department of Justice; and to convey without cost to States and political subdivisions and instrumentalities thereof property for streets and other public thoroughfares and easements for public purposes: <em>Provided</em>, That any instrument executed by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and purporting to convey any right, title or interest in any property acquired pursuant to this subchapter or subchapter X of this chapter shall be conclusive evidence of compliance with the provisions thereof insofar as title or other interest of any bona fide purchasers, lessees or transferees of such property is concerned. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Act, housing or community facilities constructed by the United States pursuant to the authority contained herein shall conform to the requirements of State and local laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations relating to health and sanitation, and, to the maximum extent practicable, taking into consideration the availability of materials and the requirements of national defense, any housing or community facilities, except housing or community facilities of a temporary character, constructed by the United States pursuant to the authority contained herein shall conform to the requirements of State or local laws, ordinances, rules, or regulations relating to building codes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Condemnation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Before condemnation proceedings are instituted pursuant to this subchapter or subchapter X of this chapter an effort shall be made to acquire the property involved by negotiation unless, because of reasonable doubt as to the identity of the owner or owners, because of the large number of persons with whom it would be necessary to negotiate, or for other reasons, the effort to acquire by negotiation would involve, in the judgment of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, such delay in acquiring the property as to be contrary to the interest of national defense. In any condemnation proceeding instituted pursuant to this subchapter or subchapter X of this chapter, the court shall not order the party in possession to surrender possession in advance of final judgment unless a declaration of taking has been filed, and a deposit of the amount estimated to be just compensation has been made, under section 258a of title 40, providing for such declarations.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contract provisions; competitive bids</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Defense or his designee is authorized to enter into contracts with any eligible bidder to provide for the construction of urgently needed housing on lands owned or leased by the United States and situated on or near a military reservation or installation for the purpose of providing suitable living accommodations for military personnel of the armed services assigned to duty at the military installation at or in the area where the housing is situated. Any such contract shall provide that each housing unit in the project shall be placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense, or his designee, as soon as the unit is available for occupancy as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Any such contract shall also provide that, except for stock held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the capital stock of the mortgagor (where the mortgagor is a corporation) be transferred to the Secretary of Defense, or his designee, when the housing has been completed as determined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. Any such contract shall contain such terms and conditions as the Secretary of Defense may determine to be necessary to protect the interests of the United States. Any such contract shall provide for the furnishing by the contractor of a performance bond and a payment bond with a surety or sureties satis<!-- PDFPage:3023 -->factory to the Secretary of Defense, or his designee, and the furnishing of such bonds shall be deemed a sufficient compliance with the provisions of section 270a of title 40, and no additional bonds shall be required under such section. Before the Secretary of Defense shall enter into any contract as authorized by this section for the construction of housing, he shall invite the submission of competitive bids after advertising in the manner prescribed in section 2305 of title 10.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Eligible bidder&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;eligible bidder&rdquo; means a person, partnership, firm, or corporation determined by the Secretary of Defense after consultation with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (1) to be qualified by experience and financial responsibility to construct housing of the type described in subsection (a) of this section, and (2) to have submitted the lowest acceptable bid.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Acquisition of capital stock of property covered by mortgage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of Defense or his designee is authorized to acquire the capital stock of mortgagors holding property covered by a mortgage insured under title VIII of the National Housing Act as amended by the Housing Amendments of 1955 [12 U.S.C. 1748 et seq.], and to exercise the rights as holder of such capital stock during the life of such mortgage and, upon the termination of the mortgage, to dissolve the corporation; to guarantee the payment of notes or other legal instruments required by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development of such mortgagors; to make payments thereon; and to guarantee and indemnify the Armed Services Housing Mortgage Insurance Fund against loss in cases where so required. All housing facilities placed under the control of the Secretary of Defense pursuant to the provisions of this subchapter shall be deemed to be housing facilities under the jurisdiction of the military department to which they are assigned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Opinion as to title to property; guarantee; title search and title insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On request by the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General shall furnish to the Secretary of Defense, or his designee, an opinion as to the sufficiency of title to any property on which it is proposed to construct housing, or on which housing has been constructed, under this section. If the opinion of the Attorney General is that the title to any such property is good and sufficient, the Secretary of Defense is authorized to guarantee, or enter into a commitment to guarantee, the mortgagee, under a mortgage on such property which is insured under title VIII of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1748 et seq.], against any losses that may thereafter arise from adverse claims to title. None of the proceeds of any mortgage loan hereafter insured under such title VIII shall be used for title search and title insurance costs: <em>Provided</em>, That if the Secretary of Defense, or his designee, determines in the case of any housing project, that the financing of the construction of such project is impossible unless title insurance is provided, the Secretary of Defense may provide for the payment of the reasonable costs necessary for obtaining title search and title insurance. Any payments by the Secretary of Defense hereunder shall be made from the revolving fund established under section 1594a(g)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1594_1_target" name="1594_1">1</a></sup> of this title. Any determination by the Secretary of Defense under the foregoing proviso shall be set forth in writing, together with the reasons therefor.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purchase price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Secretary of Defense or his designee deems it necessary for the purpose of this subchapter, he may acquire, by purchase, donation, condemnation, or other means of transfer, any land or (with the approval of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development) (1) any housing financed with mortgages insured under title VIII of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1748 et seq.] as in effect prior to August 11, 1955, or (2) any housing situated adjacent to a military installation which was (A) completed prior to July 1, 1952, (B) certified by the Department of Defense, prior to construction, as being necessary to meet an existing military family housing need and considered as military housing by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and (C) financed with mortgages insured under section 207 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1713], or (3) any housing situated on or adjacent to a military installation which was (A) completed prior to July 1, 1952, (B) considered by the Department of Defense, prior to construction, as being necessary to meet an existing military family housing need and considered as military housing by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and (C) financed with mortgages insured under section 608 of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1743], including adjacent property constructed primarily to provide commercial facilities for the occupants of such housing. The purchase price of any such housing shall not exceed the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development's estimate of the replacement cost of such housing and related property (not including the value of any improvements installed or constructed with appropriated funds) as of the date of final endorsement for mortgage insurance reduced by an appropriate allowance representing the estimated cost of repairs and replacements necessary to restore the property to sound physical condition, as determined by the Secretary of Defense or his designee upon the advice of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development: <em>Provided</em>, That in any case where the Secretary of Defense or his designee acquires a project held by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the price paid shall not exceed the face value of the debentures (plus accrued interest thereon) which the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development issued in acquiring such project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Housing at or near a military installation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any provision of subsection (a) of this section to the contrary, the Secretary of Defense or his designee shall, in the manner provided in subsection (a) of this section, acquire by purchase, donation, or other means of transfer or, if the parties cannot agree upon terms for acquisition by such means, by condemnation, any housing described in clause (1) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section which is located at or near a military installation where the construction of housing under the Armed Services Housing Mortgage Insurance Program has been approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Condemnation; procedures; deposit; payment; interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Condemnation proceedings instituted pursuant to this section shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of section 257 of title 40, or any other applicable Federal statute. Before any such condemnation proceedings are instituted, an effort shall be made to acquire the property involved by negotiation. In any such condemnation proceedings, and in the interests of expedition, the issue of just compensation may be determined by a commission of three qualified, disinterested persons to be appointed by the court. Any commission appointed hereunder shall give full consideration to all elements of value in accordance with existing law, and shall have the powers of a master provided in subdivision (c) of rule 53 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and proceedings before it shall be governed by the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) of subdivision (d) of such rule. Its action and report shall be determined by a majority and its findings and report shall have the effect, and be dealt with by the court in accordance with the practice prescribed in paragraph (2) of subdivision (e) of such rule. Trial of all issues, other than just compensation, shall be by the court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any condemnation proceedings instituted to acquire any such housing, or interest therein, the court shall not order the party in possession to surrender possession in advance of final judgment unless a declaration of taking has been filed, and a deposit of the amount estimated to be just compensation has been made, under section 258a of title 40. The amount of such deposit for the purpose of this section shall not in any case be less than an amount equal to the actual cost of the housing (not including the value of any improvements installed or constructed with appropriated funds) as certified by the sponsor or owner of the project to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to any statute or any regulations issued by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, reduced by the amount of the principal obligation of the mortgage outstanding at the time possession is surrendered, but any such deposit shall not include any excess mortgage proceeds or &ldquo;windfalls,&rdquo; kickbacks and rebates received in connection with the construction of said housing as determined by the Department of Defense, or any other Federal agency. The amount of such deposit in any case where the sponsor or owner has not certified the cost of the project to the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development at August 10, 1959, shall be determined by the Secretary of Defense, or his designee, in accordance with sections 258a to 258e&ndash;1 of title 40, with a view toward accurately estimating the equity of the sponsor or owner: <em>Provided</em>, That in the event there is withdrawn from the registry of the court by the owner or sponsor a sum of money in excess of the final award of just compensation, this excess shall be repaid to the United States plus a sum equal to 4 per centum per annum on such excess from the time such sum is deposited in the registry of the court: <em>Provided further</em>, That any court in which money is deposited as provided in this section shall require the furnishing of security by the <!-- PDFPage:3025 -->owner to protect the United States from any loss by reason of a final award of just compensation of less than the amount deposited: <em>And provided further</em>, That the deposit required to be made by this section shall be without prejudice to any party in the determination of just compensation. Unless title is in dispute, the court, upon application and subject to the foregoing provisions of this subsection, shall promptly pay to the owner at least 75 per centum of the amount so deposited, but such payment shall be made without prejudice to any party to the proceeding. In the event that condemnation proceedings are instituted in accordance with procedures under sections 258a to 258e&ndash;1 of title 40, the court shall order that the amount deposited shall be paid in a lump sum or over a period not exceeding five years in accordance with stipulations executed by the parties in the proceedings. In connection with condemnation proceedings which do not utilize the procedures under such sections, the Secretary of Defense or his designee, after final judgment of the court, may pay or agree to pay in a lump sum or, in accordance with stipulations executed by the parties to the proceedings, over a period not exceeding five years the difference between the outstanding principal obligation, plus accrued interest, and the price for the property fixed by the court. Unless such payment is made in a lump sum, the unpaid balance thereof shall bear interest at the rate of 4 per centum per annum.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Occupancy; use, or improvement of property before approval of title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Property acquired under this section may be occupied, used, and improved for the purposes of this section prior to the approval of title by the Attorney General as required by section 255 of title 40.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Release of accrual requirements for replacement, taxes, and hazard insurance reserves</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Defense or his designee may, in the case of any housing acquired or to be acquired under this section, make arrangements with the mortgage whereby such mortgage will agree to release and waive all requirements of accruals for reserves for replacement, taxes, and hazard insurance provided for under the corporate charter and indenture agreement with respect to such housing, upon the execution of a written agreement by the Secretary or his designee that the purposes for which such reserves and other funds were accrued will be carried out.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Use as public quarters or lease of housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any housing acquired under this section may be (1) assigned as public quarters to military personnel and their dependents; or (2) leased to military and civilian personnel for occupancy by them and their dependents, upon such terms and conditions as will in the judgment of the Secretary of Defense or his designee be in the best interest of the United States, without loss to military personnel of their basic allowance for quarters or appropriate allotments.</p>
