<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Persons shall be certified for participation in accordance with general procedures prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A State may consider pregnant women who meet the income eligibility standards to be presumptively eligible to participate in the program and may certify the women for participation immediately, without delaying certification until an evaluation is made concerning nutritional risk. A nutritional risk evaluation of such a woman shall be completed not later than 60 days after the woman is certified for participation. If it is subsequently determined that the woman does not meet nutritional risk criteria, the certification of the woman shall terminate on the date of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall report biennially to Congress and the National Advisory Council on Maternal, Infant, and Fetal Nutrition established under subsection (k) of this section on&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may authorize a State agency to expend for purposes of nutrition education an amount that is less than the difference between the aggregate amount described in subparagraph (A) and the amount expended by the State for breastfeeding promotion and support programs if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the State agency so requests; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the request is accompanied by documentation that other funds will be used to conduct such activities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall limit to a minimal level any documentation required under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) In the case of fiscal year 1996 (except as provided in subparagraph (G)) and each subsequent fiscal year, the national minimum breastfeeding promotion expenditure means an amount that is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) equal to $21 multiplied by the number of pregnant women and breastfeeding women participating in the program nationwide, based on the average number of pregnant women and breastfeeding women so participating during the last 3 months for which the Secretary has final data; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), in any fiscal year that a State agency achieves, through use of acceptable measures, participation that exceeds the participation level estimated for such State agency under paragraph (2)(A)(ii)(I), such State agency may convert amounts allocated for food benefits for such fiscal year for costs of nutrition services and administration to the extent that such conversion is necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to cover allowable expenditures in such fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to ensure that the State agency maintains the level established for the per participant grant for nutrition services and administration for such fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a State agency increases its participation level through measures that are not in the nutritional interests of participants or not otherwise allowable (such as reducing the quantities of foods provided for reasons not related to nutritional need), the Secretary may refuse to allow the State agency to convert amounts allocated for food benefits to defray costs of nutrition services and administration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For the purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;acceptable measures&rdquo; includes use of cost containment measures, curtailment of vendor abuse, and breastfeeding promotion activities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) examined the feasibility of implementing cost containment measures with respect to procurement of infant formula, and, where practicable, other foods necessary to carry out the program under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) initiated action to implement such measures unless the State demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that such measures would not lower costs or would interfere with the delivery of formula or foods to participants in the program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) any other cost containment measure that yields savings equal to or greater than savings generated by a competitive bidding system when such savings are determined by comparing the amounts of savings that would be provided over the full term of contracts offered in response to a single invitation to submit both competitive bids and bids for other cost containment systems for the sale of infant formula.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In determining whether a cost containment measure other than competitive bidding yields equal or greater savings, the State, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, may take into account other cost factors (in addition to rebate levels and procedures for adjusting rebate levels when wholesale price levels rise), such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the number of infants who would not be expected to receive the contract brand of infant formula under a competitive bidding system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the number of cans of infant formula for which no rebate would be provided under another rebate system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) differences in administrative costs relating to the implementation of the various cost containment systems (such as costs of converting a computer system for the purpose of operating a cost containment system and costs of preparing participants for conversion to a new or alternate cost containment system).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of any State that has a contract in effect on November 10, 1989, subparagraph (B) shall not apply to the program operated by such State under this section until the term of such contract, as such term is specified by the contract as in effect on November 10, 1989, expires. In the case of any State that has more than 1 such contract in effect on November 10, 1989, subparagraph (B) shall not apply until the term of the contract with the latest expiration date, as such term is specified by such contract as in effect on November 10, 1989, expires.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) The Secretary shall waive the requirement of subparagraph (B) in the case of any State that demonstrates to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) compliance with subparagraph (B) would be inconsistent with efficient or effective operation of the program operated by such State under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the amount by which the savings yielded by an alternative cost containment system would be less than the savings yielded by a competitive bidding system is sufficiently minimal that the difference is not significant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall prescribe criteria under which a waiver may be granted pursuant to clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall provide information on a timely basis to the Committee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry of the Senate on waivers that have been granted under clause (i).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary may waive the requirement of subparagraph (B) in the case of any Indian State agency that has not more than 1,000 participants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) No State may enter into a cost containment contract (in this subparagraph referred to as the &ldquo;original contract&rdquo;) that prescribes conditions that would void, reduce the savings under, or otherwise limit the original contract if the State solicited or secured bids for, or entered into, a subsequent cost containment contract to take effect after the expiration of the original contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) The Secretary shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost-containment contracts to be entered into by infant formula manufacturers and State agencies. The Secretary shall make the offer to State agencies once every 12 months. Each such bid solicitation shall only take place if two or more State agencies request the Secretary to perform the solicitation. For such State agencies, the Secretary shall solicit bids and select the winning bidder for a cost containment contract to be entered into by State agencies and infant formula manufacturers or suppliers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary determines that the number of State agencies making the election in clause (i) so warrants, the Secretary may, in <!-- PDFPage:2507 -->consultation with such State agencies, divide such State agencies into more than one group of such agencies and solicit bids for a contract for each such group. In determining the size of the groups of agencies, the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, take into account the need to maximize the number of potential bidders so as to increase competition among infant formula manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) State agencies that elect to authorize the Secretary to perform the bid solicitation and selection process on their behalf and enter into the resulting containment contract shall obtain the rebates or discounts from the manufacturers or suppliers participating in the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In soliciting bids and determining the winning bidder under clause (i), the Secretary shall comply with the requirements of subparagraphs (B) and (F).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v)(I) Except as provided in subclause (II), the term of the contract for which bids are to be solicited under this paragraph shall be announced by the Secretary in consultation with the affected State agencies and shall be not less than 2 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) If the law of a State regarding the duration of contracts is inconsistent with subclause (I), the Secretary shall permit a 1-year contract, with the option provided to the State to extend the contract for additional years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) In prescribing specifications for the bids, the Secretary shall ensure that the contracts to be entered into by the State agencies and the infant formula manufacturers or suppliers provide for a constant net price for infant formula products for the full term of the contracts and provide for rebates or discounts for all units of infant formula sold through the program that are produced by the manufacturer awarded the contract and that are for a type of formula product covered under the contract. The contracts shall cover all types of infant formula products normally covered under cost containment contracts entered into by State agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) The Secretary shall also develop procedures for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) rejecting all bids for any joint contract and announcing a resolicitation of infant formula bids where necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) permitting a State agency that has authorized the Secretary to undertake bid solicitation on its behalf under this subparagraph to decline to enter into the joint contract to be negotiated and awarded pursuant to the solicitation if the agency promptly determines after the bids are opened that participation would not be in the best interest of its program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) assuring infant formula manufacturers submitting a bid under this subparagraph that a contract awarded pursuant to the bid will cover State agencies serving no fewer than a number of infants to be specified in the bid solicitation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) The bid solicitation and selection process on behalf of the State agencies shall be conducted in accordance with any procedures the Secretary deems necessary for the effective and efficient administration of the bid solicitation and selection process and consistent with the requirements of this subparagraph. The procedures established by the Secretary shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the bid solicitation and selection process is conducted in a manner providing full and open competition; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the bid solicitation and selection process is free of any real or apparent conflict of interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ix) Not later than September 30, 1996, the Secretary shall offer to solicit bids on behalf of State agencies regarding cost containment contracts to be entered into by infant cereal manufacturers and State agencies. In carrying out this clause, the Secretary shall, to the maximum extent feasible, follow the procedures prescribed in this subparagraph regarding offers made by the Secretary with regard to soliciting bids regarding infant formula cost containment contracts. The Secretary may carry out this clause without issuing regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H) In soliciting bids for contracts for infant formula for the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall solicit bids from infant formula manufacturers under procedures in which bids for rebates or discounts are solicited for milk-based and soy-based infant formula, separately, except where the Secretary determines that such solicitation procedures are not in the best interest of the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I) To reduce the costs of any supplemental foods, the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall promote, but not require, the joint purchase of infant formula among State agencies electing not to participate under the procedures set forth in subparagraph (G);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall encourage and promote (but not require) the purchase of supplemental foods other than infant formula under cost containment procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) shall inform State agencies of the benefits of cost containment and provide assistance and technical advice at State agency request regarding the State agency's use of cost containment procedures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) shall encourage (but not require) the joint purchase of supplemental foods other than infant formula under procedures specified in subparagraph (B), if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the anticipated savings are expected to be significant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) the administrative expenses involved in purchasing the food item through competitive bidding procedures, whether under a rebate or discount system, will not exceed the savings anticipated to be generated by the procedures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) the procedures would be consistent with the purposes of the program; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
