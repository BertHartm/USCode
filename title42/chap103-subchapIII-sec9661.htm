<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Acquisition of property in Emergency Declaration Area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;) may make grants not to exceed $2,500,000 to the State of New York (or to any duly constituted public agency or authority thereof) for purposes of acquisition of private property in the Love Canal Emergency Declaration Area. Such acquisition shall include (but shall not be limited to) all private property within the Emergency Declaration Area, including non-owner occupied residential properties, commercial, industrial, public, religious, non-profit, and vacant properties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procedures for acquisition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No property shall be acquired pursuant to this section unless the property owner voluntarily agrees to such acquisition. Compensation for any property acquired pursuant to this section shall be based upon the fair market value of the property as it existed prior to the emergency declaration. Valuation procedures for property acquired with funds provided under this section shall be in accordance with those set forth in the agreement entered into between the New York State Disaster Preparedness Commission and the Love Canal Revitalization Agency on October 9, 1980.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) State ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall not provide any funds under this section for the acquisition of any properties pursuant to this section unless a public agency or authority of the State of New York first enters into a cooperative agreement with the Administrator providing assurances deemed adequate by the Administrator that the State or an agency created under the laws of the State shall take title to the properties to be so acquired.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Maintenance of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall enter into a cooperative agreement with an appropriate public agency or authority of the State of New York under which the Administrator shall maintain or arrange for the maintenance of all properties within the Emergency Declaration Area that have been acquired by any public agency or authority of the State. Ninety (90) percent of the costs of such maintenance shall be paid by the Administrator. The remaining portion of such costs shall be paid by the State (unless a credit is available under section 9604(c) of this title). The Administrator is authorized, in his discretion, to provide technical assistance to any public agency or authority of the State of New York in order to implement the recommendations of the habitability and land-use study in order to put the land within the Emergency Declaration Area to its best use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Habitability and land use study</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) compare the level of hazardous waste contamination in that Area to that present in other comparable communities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assess the potential uses of the land within the Emergency Declaration Area, including but not limited to residential, industrial, commercial and recreational, and the risks associated with such potential uses.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="note-head">Love Canal Property Acquisition; Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 213(a) of Pub. L. 99&ndash;499 provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(1) The area known as Love Canal located in the city of Niagara Falls and the town of Wheatfield, New York, was the first toxic waste site to receive national attention. As a result of that attention Congress investigated the problems associated with toxic waste sites and enacted CERCLA [Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.)] to deal with these problems.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Because Love Canal came to the Nation's attention prior to the passage of CERCLA and because the fund under CERCLA was not available to compensate for all of the hardships endured by the citizens in the area, Congress has determined that special provisions are required. These provisions do not affect the lawfulness, implementation, or selection of any other response actions at Love Canal or at any other facilities.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Coordination of Titles I to IV of Pub. L. 99&ndash;499</h4>
<p class="note-body">Any provision of titles I to IV of Pub. L. 99&ndash;499, imposing any tax, premium, or fee; establishing any trust fund; or authorizing expenditures from any trust fund, to have no force or effect, see section 531 of Pub. L. 99&ndash;499, set out as a note under section 1 of Title 26, Internal Revenue Code.</p>
