<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exclusion of certain funds</h4>

If the Secretary determines that a State has failed to maintain such compliance, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allotment under section 300x&ndash;21 of this title for the State for the fiscal year for which the grant is being made by an amount equal to the amount constituting such failure for the previous fiscal year.</p>
