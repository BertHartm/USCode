<h4 class="note-head">Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;314, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1266, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 2000&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a crucial and essential role in the Nation's child welfare system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for abused and neglected children under the supervision of that system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105&ndash;89; 111 Stat. 2115) [see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1305 of this title] establishes explicitly for the first time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be the paramount consideration when any decision is made regarding a child in the Nation's child welfare system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by requiring timely decision<!-- PDFPage:1615 -->making in proceedings to determine whether children can safely return to their families or whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the foster care system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 specifically requires, among other things, that States move to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) While essential to protect children and to carry out the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that Act increase the pressure on the Nation's already overburdened abuse and neglect courts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially improved by the acquisition and implementation of computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe and stable families. Such systems could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by the identification and implementation of projects designed to eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing caseloads.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further strengthened by improving the quality and availability of training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who represent the children and the parents of children in abuse and neglect proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this country are already committed to the quality administration of justice, the performance of such courts would be even further enhanced by the development of models and educational opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, case management, representation of children, automated interagency interfaces, and &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run efficiently and effectively. The performance of those individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange ideas with their peers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court system. The Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit from an expansion of this program to currently underserved communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by reducing the average length of an abused and neglected child's stay in foster care, improving the quality of decision-making and court services provided to children and families, and increasing the number of adoptions.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) studies indicate that a number of factors contribute to the inability of some parents to provide adequate care for their infants and young children and a lack of suitable shelter homes for such infants and young children have led to the abandonment of such infants and young children in hospitals for extended periods;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) an unacceptable number of these infants and young children will be medically cleared for discharge, yet remain in hospitals as boarder babies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) hospital-based child care for these infants and young children is extremely costly and deprives them of an adequate nurturing environment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) appropriate training is needed for personnel working with infants and young children with life-threatening conditions and other special needs, including those who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (commonly known as &lsquo;HIV&rsquo;), those who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (commonly known as &lsquo;AIDS&rsquo;), and those who have been exposed to dangerous drugs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) infants and young children who are abandoned in hospitals are particularly difficult to place in foster homes, and are being abandoned in hospitals in increasing numbers by mothers dying of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, by parents abusing drugs, or by parents incapable of providing adequate care;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) there is a need for comprehensive support services for such infants and young children and their families and services to prevent the abandonment of such infants and young children, including foster care services, case management services, family support services, respite and crisis intervention services, counseling services, and group residential home services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) there is a need to support the families of such infants and young children through the provision of services that will prevent the abandonment of the infants and children; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) private, Federal, State, and local resources should be coordinated to establish and maintain services described in paragraph (7) and to ensure the optimal use of all such resources.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Each State with a plan approved under this part shall make foster care maintenance payments (as defined in section 675(4) of this title) under this part with respect to a child who would have met the requirements of section 606(a) of this title or of section 607 of this title (as such sections were in effect on July 16, 1996) but for his removal from the home of a relative (specified in section 606(a) of this title (as so in effect)), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the removal from the home occurred pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement entered into by the child's parent or legal guardian, or was the result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child and (effective October 1, 1983) that reasonable efforts of the type described in section 671(a)(15) of this title for a child have been made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such child's placement and care are the responsibility of (A) the State agency administering the State plan approved under section 671 of this title, or (B) any other public agency with whom the State agency administering or supervising the administration of the State plan approved under section 671 of this title has made an agreement which is still in effect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such child has been placed in a foster family home or child-care institution as a result of the voluntary placement agreement or judicial determination referred to in paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such child&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) would have received aid under the State plan approved under section 602 of this title (as in effect on July 16, 1996) in or for the month in which such agreement was entered into or court proceedings leading to the removal of such child from the home were initiated, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) would have received such aid in or for such month if application had been made therefor, or (ii) had been living with a relative specified in section 606(a) of this title (as in effect on July 16, 1996) within six months prior to the month in which such agreement was entered into or such proceedings were initiated, and would have received such aid in or for such month if in such month he had been living with such a relative and application therefor had been made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In any case where the child is an alien disqualified under section 1255a(h), 1160(f), or 1161(d)(7)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#672_1_target" name="672_1">1</a></sup> of title 8 from receiving aid under the State plan approved under section 602 of this title in or for the month in which such agreement was entered into or court proceedings leading to the removal of the child from the home were instituted, such child shall be considered to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (4) (and the corresponding requirements of section 673(a)(2)(B) of this title), with respect to that month, if he or she would have satisfied such requirements but for such disqualification. In determining whether a child would have received aid under a State plan approved under section 602 of this title (as in effect on July 16, 1996), a child whose resources (determined pursuant to section 602(a)(7)(B) of this title, as so in effect) have a combined value of not more than $10,000 shall be considered to be a child whose resources have a combined value of not more than $1,000 (or such lower amount as the State may determine for purposes of such section 602(a)(7)(B) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Additional qualifications</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in a child-care institution, whether the payments therefor are made to such institution or to a public or nonprofit private child-placement or child-care agency, which payments shall be limited so as to include in such payments only those items which are included in the term &ldquo;foster care maintenance payments&rdquo; (as defined in section 675(4) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Foster family home&rdquo; and &ldquo;child-care institution&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this part, (1) the term &ldquo;foster family home&rdquo; means a foster family home for children which is licensed by the State in which it is situated or has been approved, by the agency of such State having responsibility for licensing homes of this type, as meeting the standards established for such licensing; and (2) the term &ldquo;child-care institution&rdquo; means a private child-care institution, or a public child-care institution which accommodates no more than twenty-five children, which is licensed by the State in which it is situated or has been approved, by the agency of such State responsible for licensing or approval of institutions of this type, as meeting the standards established for such licensing, but the term shall not include detention facilities, forestry camps, training <!-- PDFPage:1626 -->schools, or any other facility operated primarily for the detention of children who are determined to be delinquent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Children removed from their homes pursuant to voluntary placement agreements</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Placements in best interest of child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No Federal payment may be made under this part with respect to amounts expended by any State as foster care maintenance payments under this section, in the case of any child who was removed from his or her home pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement as described in subsection (a) of this section and has remained in voluntary placement for a period in excess of 180 days, unless there has been a judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction (within the first 180 days of such placement) to the effect that such placement is in the best interests of the child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Voluntary placement&rdquo; and &ldquo;voluntary placement agreement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this part and part B of this subchapter, (1) the term &ldquo;voluntary placement&rdquo; means an out-of-home placement of a minor, by or with participation of a State agency, after the parents or guardians of the minor have requested the assistance of the agency and signed a voluntary placement agreement; and (2) the term &ldquo;voluntary placement agreement&rdquo; means a written agreement, binding on the parties to the agreement, between the State agency, any other agency acting on its behalf, and the parents or guardians of a minor child which specifies, at a minimum, the legal status of the child and the rights and obligations of the parents or guardians, the child, and the agency while the child is in placement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Revocation of voluntary placement agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case where&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the placement of a minor child in foster care occurred pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement entered into by the parents or guardians of such child as provided in subsection (a) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such parents or guardians request (in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe) that the child be returned to their home or to the home of a relative,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the voluntary placement agreement shall be deemed to be revoked unless the State agency opposes such request and obtains a judicial determination, by a court of competent jurisdiction, that the return of the child to such home would be contrary to the child's best interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Aid for dependent children; assistance for minor children in needy families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of subchapter XIX of this chapter, any child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are made under this section is deemed to be a dependent child as defined in section 606 of this title (as in effect as of July 16, 1996) and deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children under part A of this subchapter (as so in effect). For purposes of subchapter XX of this chapter, any child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are made under this section is deemed to be a minor child in a needy family under a State program funded under part A of this subchapter and is deemed to be a recipient of assistance under such part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1), a child whose costs in a foster family home or child care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to the child's minor parent, as provided in section 675(4)(B) of this title, shall be considered a child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are made under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Agreements with adoptive parents of children with special needs; State payments; qualifying children; amount of payments; changes in circumstances; placement period prior to adoption; nonrecurring adoption expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Each State having a plan approved under this part shall enter into adoption assistance agreements (as defined in section 675(3) of this title) with the adoptive parents of children with special needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under any adoption assistance agreement entered into by a State with parents who adopt a child with special needs, the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall make payments of nonrecurring adoption expenses incurred by or on behalf of such parents in connection with the adoption of such child, directly through the State agency or through another public or nonprofit private agency, in amounts determined under paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in any case where the child meets the requirements of paragraph (2), may make adoption assistance payments to such parents, directly through the State agency or through another public or nonprofit private agency, in amounts so determined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a child meets the requirements of this paragraph if such child&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) at the time adoption proceedings were initiated, met the requirements of section 606(a) of this title or section 607 of this title (as such sections were in effect on July 16, 1996) or would have met such requirements except for his removal from the home of a relative (specified in section 606(a) of this title (as so in effect)), either pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement with respect to which Federal payments are provided under section 674 (or 603 (as such section was in effect on July 16, 1996)) of this title or as a result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) meets all of the requirements of subchapter XVI of this chapter with respect to eligibility for supplemental security income benefits, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to his or her minor parent as provided in section 675(4)(B) of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) would have received aid under the State plan approved under section 602 of this title (as in effect on July 16, 1996) in or for the month in which such agreement was entered into or court proceedings leading to the removal of such child from the home were initiated, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii)(I) would have received such aid in or for such month if application had been made therefor, or (II) had been living with a relative specified in section 606(a) of this title (as in effect on July 16, 1996) within six months prior to the month in which such agreement was entered into or such proceedings were initiated, and would have received such aid in or for such month if in such month he had been living with such a relative and application therefor had been made, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is a child described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (A)(iii), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) has been determined by the State, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, to be a child with special needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The last sentence of section 672(a) of this title shall apply, for purposes of subparagraph (B), in any case where the child is an alien described in that sentence. Any child who meets the requirements of subparagraph (C), who was determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under this part with respect to a prior adoption, who is available for adoption because the prior adoption has been dissolved and the parental rights of the adoptive parents have been terminated or because the child's adoptive parents have died, and who fails to meet the requirements of subparagraphs (A) and (B) but would meet such requirements if the child were treated as if the child were in the same financial and other circumstances the child was in the last time the child was determined eligible for adoption assistance payments under this part and the prior adoption were treated as never having occurred, shall be treated as meeting the requirements of this paragraph for purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of the payments to be made in any case under clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1)(B) shall be determined through agreement between the adoptive parents and the State or local agency administering the program under this section, which shall take into consideration the circumstances of the adopting parents and the needs of the child being adopted, and may be readjusted periodically, with the concurrence of the adopting parents (which may be specified in the adoption assistance agreement), depending upon changes in such circumstances. However, in no case may the amount of the adoption assistance payment made under clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(B) exceed the foster care maintenance payment which would have been paid during the period if the child with respect to whom the adoption assistance payment is made had been in a foster family home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, (A) no payment may be made to parents with respect to any child who has attained the age of eighteen (or, where the State determines that the child has a mental or physical handicap which warrants the continuation of assistance, the age of twenty-one), and (B) no payment may be made to parents with respect to any child if the State determines that the parents are no longer legally responsible for the support of the child or if the State determines that the child is no longer receiving any support from such par<!-- PDFPage:1629 -->ents. Parents who have been receiving adoption assistance payments under this section shall keep the State or local agency administering the program under this section informed of circumstances which would, pursuant to this subsection, make them ineligible for such assistance payments, or eligible for assistance payments in a different amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this part, individuals with whom a child (who has been determined by the State, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, to be a child with special needs) is placed for adoption in accordance with applicable State and local law shall be eligible for such payments, during the period of the placement, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as if such individuals had adopted such child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(i), the term &ldquo;nonrecurring adoption expenses&rdquo; means reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs and which are not incurred in violation of State or Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A State's payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses under an adoption assistance agreement shall be treated as an expenditure made for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan for purposes of section 674(a)(3)(E) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Aid for dependent children; assistance for minor children in needy families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of subchapter XIX of this chapter, any child who is described in paragraph (3) is deemed to be a dependent child as defined in section 606 of this title (as in effect as of July 16, 1996) and deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children under part A of this subchapter (as so in effect) in the State where such child resides.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subchapter XX of this chapter, any child who is described in paragraph (3) is deemed to be a minor child in a needy family under a State program funded under part A of this subchapter and deemed to be a recipient of assistance under such part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A child described in this paragraph is any child&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) who is a child described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to whom an adoption assistance agreement is in effect under this section (whether or not adoption assistance payments are provided under the agreement or are being made under this section), including any such child who has been placed for adoption in accordance with applicable State and local law (whether or not an interlocutory or other judicial decree of adoption has been issued), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are being made under section 672 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to the child's minor parent, as provided in section 675(4)(B) of this title, shall be considered a child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are being made under section 672 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Children with special needs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a child shall not be considered a child with special needs unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the State has determined that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his parents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the State had first determined (A) that there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or condition (such as his ethnic background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that such child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, and (B) that, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in the care of such parents as a foster child, a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;145, &sect;2, Dec. 2, 2003, 117 Stat. 1879, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In 1997, the Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 [Pub. L. 105&ndash;89; see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1305 of this title] to promote comprehensive child welfare reform to ensure that consideration of children's safety is paramount in child welfare decisions, and to provide a greater sense of urgency to find every child a safe, permanent home.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 also created the Adoption Incentives program, which authorizes incentive payments to States to promote adoptions, with additional incentives provided for the adoption of foster children with special needs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Since 1997, all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have qualified for incentive pay<!-- PDFPage:1634 -->ments for their work in promoting adoption of foster children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Between 1997 and 2002, adoptions increased by 64 percent, and adoptions of children with special needs increased by 63 percent; however, 542,000 children remain in foster care, and 126,000 are eligible for adoption.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Although substantial progress has been made to promote adoptions, attention should be focused on promoting adoption of older children. Recent data suggest that half of the children waiting to be adopted are age 9 or older.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the net amount recovered during any quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to foster care and adoption assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Within 60 days after receipt of a State claim for expenditures pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall allow, disallow, or defer such claim.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within 15 days after a decision to defer such a State claim, the Secretary shall notify the State of the reasons for the deferral and of the additional information necessary to determine the allowability of the claim.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction for violation of plan requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If, during any quarter of a fiscal year, a State's program operated under this part is found, as a result of a review conducted under section 1320a&ndash;2a of this title, or otherwise, to have violated paragraph (18) or (23) of section 671(a) of this title with respect to a person or to have failed to implement a corrective action plan within a period of time not to exceed 6 months with respect to such violation, then, notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and any regulations promulgated under section 1320a&ndash;2a(b)(3) of this title, the Secretary shall reduce the amount otherwise payable to the State under this part, for that fiscal year quarter and for any subsequent quarter of such fiscal year, until the State program is found, as a result of a subsequent review under section 1320a&ndash;2a of this title, to have implemented a corrective action plan with respect to such violation, by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 2 percent of such otherwise payable amount, in the case of the 1st such finding for the fiscal year with respect to the State;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In imposing the penalties described in this paragraph, the Secretary shall not reduce any fiscal year payment to a State by more than 5 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any other entity which is in a State that receives funds under this part and which violates paragraph (18) or (23) of section 671(a) of this title during a fiscal year quarter with respect to any person shall remit to the Secretary all funds that were paid by the State to the entity during the quarter from such funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any individual who is aggrieved by a violation of section 671(a)(18) of this title by a State or other entity may bring an action seeking relief from the State or other entity in any United States district court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount, if any, allotted to the State under section 677(c)(3) of this title for the fiscal year in which the quarter occurs, reduced by the total of the amounts payable to the State under this subsection for such purposes for all prior quarters in the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reduction for failure to submit required data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary finds that a State has failed to submit to the Secretary data, as required by regulation, for the data collection system implemented under section 679 of this title, the Secretary shall, within 30 days after the date by which the data was due to be so submitted, notify the State of the failure and that payments to the State under this part will be reduced if the State fails to submit the data, as so required, within 6 months after the date the data was originally due to be so submitted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary finds that the State has failed to submit the data, as so required, by the <!-- PDFPage:1636 -->end of the 6-month period referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, then, notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section and any regulations promulgated under section 1320a&ndash;2a(b)(3) of this title, the Secretary shall reduce the amounts otherwise payable to the State under this part, for each quarter ending in the 6-month period (and each quarter ending in each subsequent consecutively occurring 6-month period until the Secretary finds that the State has submitted the data, as so required), by&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the status of each child is reviewed periodically but no less frequently than once every six months by either a court or by administrative review (as defined in paragraph (6)) in order to determine the safety of the child, the continuing necessity for and appropriateness of the placement, the extent of compliance with the case plan, and the extent of progress which has been made toward alleviating or mitigating the causes necessitating placement in foster care, and to project a likely date by which the child may be returned to and safely maintained in the home or placed for adoption or legal guardianship,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with respect to each such child, procedural safeguards will be applied, among other things, to assure each child in foster care under the supervision of the State of a permanency hearing to be held, in a family or juvenile court or another court (including a tribal court) of competent jurisdiction, or by an administrative body appointed or approved by the court, no later than 12 months after the date the child is considered to have entered foster care (as determined under subparagraph (F)) (and not less frequently than every 12 months thereafter during the continuation of foster care), which hearing shall determine the permanency plan for the child that includes whether, and if applicable when, the child will be returned to the parent, placed for adoption and the State will file a petition for termination of parental rights, or referred for legal guardianship, or (in cases where the State agency has documented to the State court a compelling reason for determining that it would not be in the best interests of the child to return home, be referred for termination of parental rights, or be placed for adoption, with a fit and willing relative, or with a legal guardian) placed in another planned permanent living arrangement and, in the case of a child described in subparagraph (A)(ii), whether the out-of-State placement continues to be appropriate and in the best interests of the child, and, in the case of a child who has attained age 16, the services needed to assist the child to make the transition from foster care to independent living; and procedural safeguards shall also be applied with respect to parental rights pertaining to the removal of the child from the home of his parents, to a change in the child's placement, and to any determination affecting visitation privileges of parents;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#675_1_target" name="675_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in the case of a child who has been in foster care under the responsibility of the State for 15 of the most recent 22 months, or, if a court of competent jurisdiction has determined a child to be an abandoned infant (as defined under State law) or has made a determination that the parent has committed murder of another child of the parent, committed voluntary manslaughter of another child of the parent, aided or abetted, attempted, conspired, or solicited to commit such a murder or such a voluntary manslaughter, or committed a felony assault that has resulted in serious bodily injury to the child or to another child of the parent, the State shall file a petition to terminate the parental rights of the child's parents (or, if such a petition has been filed by another party, seek to be joined as a party to the petition), and, concurrently, to identify, recruit, process, and approve a qualified family for an adoption, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at the option of the State, the child is being cared for by a relative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a State agency has documented in the case plan (which shall be available for court review) a compelling reason for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the State has not provided to the family of the child, consistent with the time period in the State case plan, such services as the State deems necessary for the safe return of the child to the child's home, if reasonable efforts of the type described in section 671(a)(15)(B)(ii) of this title are required to be made with respect to the child;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#675_1_target" name="675_1">1</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) a child shall be considered to have entered foster care on the earlier of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the date of the first judicial finding that the child has been subjected to child abuse or neglect; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the date that is 60 days after the date on which the child is removed from the home;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#675_1_target" name="675_1">1</a></sup> and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the foster parents (if any) of a child and any preadoptive parent or relative providing care for the child are provided with notice of, and an opportunity to be heard in, <!-- PDFPage:1640 -->any review or hearing to be held with respect to the child, except that this subparagraph shall not be construed to require that any foster parent, preadoptive parent, or relative providing care for the child be made a party to such a review or hearing solely on the basis of such notice and opportunity to be heard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide personal and emotional support to children aging out of foster care, through mentors and the promotion of interactions with dedicated adults;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to provide financial, housing, counseling, employment, education, and other appropriate support and services to former foster care recipients between 18 and 21 years of age to complement their own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency and to assure that program participants recognize and accept their personal responsibility for preparing for and then making the transition from adolescence to adulthood; and</p>
