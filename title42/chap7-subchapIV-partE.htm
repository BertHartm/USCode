<h4 class="note-head">Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;314, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1266, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 2000&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a crucial and essential role in the Nation's child welfare system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for abused and neglected children under the supervision of that system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105&ndash;89; 111 Stat. 2115) [see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1305 of this title] establishes explicitly for the first time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be the paramount consideration when any decision is made regarding a child in the Nation's child welfare system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by requiring timely decisionmaking in proceedings to determine whether children can safely return to their families or whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the foster care system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 specifically requires, among other things, that States move to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) While essential to protect children and to carry out the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that Act increase the pressure on the Nation's already overburdened abuse and neglect courts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially improved by the acquisition and implementation of computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe and stable families. Such systems could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by the identification and implementation of projects designed to eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing caseloads.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further strengthened by improving the quality and availability of training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who represent the children and the parents of children in abuse and neglect proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this country are already committed to the quality administration of justice, the performance of such courts would be even further enhanced by the development of models and educational opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, case management, representation of children, automated interagency interfaces, and &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run efficiently and effectively. The performance of those individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange ideas with their peers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court system. The Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit from an expansion of this program to currently underserved communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by reducing the average length of an abused and neglected child's stay in foster care, improving the quality of decision-making and court services provided to children and families, and increasing the number of adoptions.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;145, &sect;2, Dec. 2, 2003, 117 Stat. 1879, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In 1997, the Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 [Pub. L. 105&ndash;89; see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1305 of this title] to promote comprehensive child welfare reform to ensure that consideration of children's safety is paramount in child welfare decisions, and to provide a greater sense of urgency to find every child a safe, permanent home.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 also created the Adoption Incentives program, which authorizes incentive payments to States to promote adoptions, with additional incentives provided for the adoption of foster children with special needs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Since 1997, all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have qualified for incentive payments for their work in promoting adoption of foster children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Between 1997 and 2002, adoptions increased by 64 percent, and adoptions of children with special needs increased by 63 percent; however, 542,000 children remain in foster care, and 126,000 are eligible for adoption.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Although substantial progress has been made to promote adoptions, attention should be focused on promoting adoption of older children. Recent data suggest that half of the children waiting to be adopted are age 9 or older.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to provide States with flexible funding that will enable programs to be designed and conducted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to identify children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age and to help these children make the transition to self-sufficiency by providing services such as assistance in obtaining a high school diploma, career exploration, vocational training, job placement and retention, training in daily living skills, training in budgeting and financial management skills, substance abuse prevention, and preventive health activities (including smoking avoidance, nutrition education, and pregnancy prevention);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to help children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age receive the education, training, and services necessary to obtain employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to help children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age prepare for and enter postsecondary training and education institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide personal and emotional support to children aging out of foster care, through mentors and the promotion of interactions with dedicated adults;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to provide financial, housing, counseling, employment, education, and other appropriate support and services to former foster care recipients between 18 and 21 years of age to complement their own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency and to assure that program participants recognize and accept their personal responsibility for preparing for and then making the transition from adolescence to adulthood;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to make available vouchers for education and training, including postsecondary training and education, to youths who have aged out of foster care; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to provide the services referred to in this subsection to children who, after attaining 16 years of age, have left foster care for kinship guardianship or adoption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may apply for funds from its allotment under subsection (c) of this section for a period of five consecutive fiscal years by submitting to the Secretary, in writing, a plan that meets the requirements of paragraph (2) and the certifications required by paragraph (3) with respect to the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan meets the requirements of this paragraph if the plan specifies which State agency <!-- PDFPage:1788 -->or agencies will administer, supervise, or oversee the programs carried out under the plan, and describes how the State intends to do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Design and deliver programs to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Ensure that all political subdivisions in the State are served by the program, though not necessarily in a uniform manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Ensure that the programs serve children of various ages and at various stages of achieving independence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Involve the public and private sectors in helping adolescents in foster care achieve independence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Use objective criteria for determining eligibility for benefits and services under the programs, and for ensuring fair and equitable treatment of benefit recipients.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Cooperate in national evaluations of the effects of the programs in achieving the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The certifications required by this paragraph with respect to a plan are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) A certification by the chief executive officer of the State that the State will provide assistance and services to children who have left foster care because they have attained 18 years of age, and who have not attained 21 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A certification by the chief executive officer of the State that not more than 30 percent of the amounts paid to the State from its allotment under subsection (c) of this section for a fiscal year will be expended for room or board for children who have left foster care because they have attained 18 years of age, and who have not attained 21 years of age.</p>
