<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Study; plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is authorized and directed to conduct a study of the most efficient methods of utilizing the hydroelectric power resources at water resource development projects under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of the Army and to prepare a plan based upon the findings of such study. Such study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the physical potential for hydroelectric development, giving consideration to the economic, social, environmental and institutional factors which will affect the realization of physical potential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the magnitude and regional distribution of needs for hydroelectric power;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the integration of hydroelectric power generation with generation from other types of generating facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) measures necessary to assure that generation from hydroelectric projects will efficiently contribute to meeting the national electric energy demands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the timing of hydroelectric development to properly coincide with changes in the demand for electric energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) conventional hydroelectric potential, both high head and low head projects utilizing run-of-rivers and possible advances in mechanical technology, and pumped storage hydroelectric potential at sites which evidence such potential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the feasibility of adding or reallocating storage and modifying operation rules to increase power production at corps projects with existing hydroelectric installations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) measures deemed necessary or desirable to insure that the potential contribution of hydroelectric resources to the overall electric energy supply are realized to the maximum extent possible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) any other pertinent factors necessary to evaluate the development and operation of hydroelectric projects of the Corps of Engineers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transmittal of plan to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within three years after the date of the first appropriation of funds for the purpose of carrying out this section, the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, shall transmit the plan prepared pursuant to subsection (a) of this section with supporting studies and documentation, together with the recommendations of the Secretary and the Chief of Engineers on such plan, to the Committee on Environment and Public Works of the Senate and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out subsections (a) and (b) of this section not to exceed $7,000,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Feasibility studies of specific hydroelectric power installations; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, is authorized with respect to previously authorized projects to undertake feasibility studies of specific hydroelectric power installations that are identified in the course of the study authorized by this section, as having high potential for contribution toward meeting regional power needs. There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this sub<!-- PDFPage:3522 -->section not to exceed $5,000,000 per fiscal year for each of the fiscal years 1978 and 1979.</p>
