<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States often suffers serious economic and environmental losses from severe regional droughts and there is no coordinated Federal strategy to respond to such emergencies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) at the Federal level, even though historically there have been frequent, significant droughts of national consequences, drought is addressed mainly through special legislation and ad hoc action rather than through a systematic and permanent process as occurs with other natural disasters;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) there is an increasing need, particularly at the Federal level, to emphasize preparedness, mitigation, and risk management (rather than simply crisis management) when addressing drought and other natural disasters or emergencies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) several Federal agencies have a role in drought from predicting, forecasting, and monitoring of drought conditions to the provision of planning, technical, and financial assistance;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) there is no single Federal agency in a lead or coordinating role with regard to drought;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) State, local, and tribal governments have had to deal individually and separately with each Federal agency involved in drought assistance; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the President should appoint an advisory commission to provide advice and recommendations on the creation of an integrated, coordinated Federal policy designed to prepare for, mitigate the impacts of, respond to, and recover from serious drought emergencies.</p>

<!-- field-start:miscellaneous-note -->
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended. The reorganization plan provides new arrangements for the conduct of Federal defense mobilization and civil defense functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">In formulating Reorganization Plan No. 1, I have had the benefit of several studies made by the executive branch as well as those conducted by the Congress. The reorganization plan will overcome the major difficulties revealed by those studies and mentioned in my 1959 budget message where I made the following statement:</p>
<p class="note-body">The structure of Federal organization for the planning, coordination, and conduct of our nonmilitary defense programs has been reviewed, and I have concluded that the existing statues assigning responsibilities for the central coordination and direction of these programs are out of date. The rapid technical advances of military science have led to a serious overlap among agencies carrying on these leadership and planning functions. Because the situation will continue to change and because these functions transcend the responsibility of any single department or agency, I have concluded that they should be vested in no one short of the President. I will make recommendations to the Congress on this subject.</p>
<p class="note-body">The principal effects of the organization plan are&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">First, it transfers to the President the functions vested by law in the Federal Civil Defense Administration and those so vested in the Office of Defense Mobilization. The result is to establish a single pattern with respect to the vesting of defense mobilization and civil defense functions. At the present time disparity exists in that civil defense functions are vested in the President only to a limited degree while a major part of the functions administered by the Office of Defense Mobilization are vested by law in the President and delegated by him to that Office. Under the plan, the broad program responsibilities for coordinating and conducting the interrelated defense mobilization and civil defense functions will be vested in the President for appropriate delegation as the rapidly changing character of the nonmilitary preparedness program warrants.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, the reorganization plan consolidates the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Federal Civil De<!-- PDFPage:4670 -->fense Administration to form a new Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization in the Executive Office of the President. I have concluded that, in many instances, the interests and activities of the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Federal Civil Defense Administration overlap to such a degree that it is not possible to work out a satisfactory division of those activities and interests between the two agencies. I have also concluded that a single civilian mobilization agency of appropriate stature and authority is needed and that such an agency will ensue from the consolidation and from the granting of suitable authority to that agency for directing and coordinating the preparedness activities of the Federal departments and agencies and for providing unified guidance and assistance to the State and local governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, the reorganization plan transfers the membership of the Director of the Office of Defense Mobilization on the National Security Council to the Director of the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization and also transfers the Civil Defense Advisory Council to the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization.</p>
<p class="note-body">Initially, the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization will perform the civil defense and defense mobilization functions now performed by the Office of Defense Mobilization and the Federal Civil Defense Administration. One of its first tasks will be to advise me with respect to the actions to be taken to clarify and expand the roles of the Federal departments and agencies in carrying out nonmilitary defense preparedness functions. After such actions are taken, the direction and coordination of the civil defense and defense mobilization activities assigned to the departments and agencies will comprise a principal remaining responsibility of the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have also found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of new officers specified in sections 2 and 3 of the plan. The rates of compensation fixed for these officers are, respectively those which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958 will immediately reduce the number of Federal agencies by one and, by providing sounder organizational arrangements for the administration of the affected functions, should promote the increased economy and effectiveness of the Federal expenditures concerned. It is, however, impracticable to itemize at this time the reduction of expenditures which it is probable will be brought about by such taking effect.</p>
<p class="note-body">I urge that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">MESSAGE OF THE PRESIDENT</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">On January 5 I announced a three-part program to streamline the executive branch of the Federal Government. By concentrating less responsibility in the President's immediate staff and more in the hands of the departments and agencies, this program should significantly improve the services of the Government. I believe these reforms have become so urgently necessary that I intend, with the cooperation of the Congress, to pursue them with all of the resources of my office during the coming year.</p>
<p class="note-body">The first part of this program is a renewed drive to achieve passage of my legislative proposals to overhaul the Cabinet departments. Secondly, I have appointed three Cabinet Secretaries as Counsellors to the President with coordinating responsibilities in the broad areas of human resources, natural resources, and com<!-- PDFPage:4671 -->munity development, and five Assistants to the President with special responsibilities in the areas of domestic affairs, economic affairs, foreign affairs, executive management, and operations of the White House.</p>
<p class="note-body">The third part of this program is a sharp reduction in the overall size of the Executive Office of the President and a reorientation of that office back to its original mission as a staff for top-level policy formation and monitoring of policy execution in broad functional areas. The Executive Office of the President should no longer be encumbered with the task of managing or administering programs which can be run more effectively by the departments and agencies. I have therefore concluded that a number of specialized operational and program functions should be shifted out of the Executive Office into the line departments and agencies of the Government. Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1973, transmitted herewith, would effect such changes with respect to emergency preparedness functions and scientific and technological affairs.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">STREAMLINING THE FEDERAL SCIENCE ESTABLISHMENT</h4>
<p class="note-body">When the National Science Foundation was established by an act of the Congress in 1950, its statutory responsibilities included evaluation of the Government's scientific research programs and development of basic science policy. In the late 1950's, however, with the effectiveness of the U.S. science effort under serious scrutiny as a result of sputnik, the post of Science Advisor to the President was established. The White House became increasingly involved in the evaluation and coordination of research and development programs and in science policy matters, and that involvement was institutionalized in 1962 when a reorganization plan established the Office of Science and Technology within the Executive Office of the President, through transfer of authorities formerly vested in the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p class="note-body">With advice and assistance from OST during the past decade; the scientific and technological capability of the Government has been markedly strengthened. This administration is firmly committed to a sustained, broadbased national effort in science and technology, as I made plain last year in the first special message on the subject ever sent by a President to the Congress. The research and development capability of the various executive departments and agencies, civilian as well as defense, has been upgraded. The National Science Foundation has broadened from its earlier concentration on basic research support to take on a significant role in applied research as well. It has matured in its ability to play a coordinating and evaluative role within the Government and between the public and private sectors.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have therefore concluded that it is timely and appropriate to transfer to the Director of the National Science Foundation all functions presently vested in the Office of Science and Technology, and to abolish that office. Reorganization Plan No. 1 would effect these changes.</p>
<p class="note-body">The multi-disciplinary staff resources of the Foundation will provide analytic capabilities for performance of the transferred functions. In addition, the Director of the Foundation will be able to draw on expertise from all of the Federal agencies, as well as from outside the Government, for assistance in carrying out his new responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">It is also my intention, after the transfer of responsibilities is effected, to ask Dr. H. Guyford Stever, the current Director of the Foundation, to take on the additional post of Science Adviser. In this capacity, he would advise and assist the White House, Office of Management and Budget, Domestic Council, and other entities within the Executive Office of the President on matters where scientific and technological expertise is called for, and would act as the President's representative in selected cooperative programs in international scientific affairs, including chairing such joint bodies as the U.S.&mdash;U.S.S.R. Joint Commission on Scientific and Technical Cooperation.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the case of national security, the Department of Defense has strong capabilities for assessing weapons needs and for undertaking new weapons development, and the President will continue to draw primarily on this source for advice regarding military technology. The President in special situations also may seek independent studies or assessments concerning military technology from within or outside the Federal establishment, using the machinery of the National Security Council for this purpose, as well as the Science Adviser when appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">In one special area of technology&mdash;space and aeronautics&mdash;a coordinating council has existed within the Executive Office of the President since 1958. This body, the National Aeronautics and Space Council, met a major need during the evolution of our nation's space program. Vice President Agnew has served with distinction as its chairman for the past four years. At my request, beginning in 1969, the Vice President also chaired a special Space Task Group charged with developing strategy alternatives for a balanced U.S. space program in the coming years.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a result of this work, basic policy issues in the United States space effort have been resolved, and the necessary interagency relationships have been established. I have therefore concluded, with the Vice President's concurrence, that the Council can be discontinued. Needed policy coordination can now be achieved through the resources of the executive departments and agencies, such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, augmented by some of the former Council staff. Accordingly, my reorganization plan proposes the abolition of the National Aeronautics and Space Council.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">A NEW APPROACH TO EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS</h4>
<p class="note-body">The organization within the Executive Office of the President which has been known in recent years as the Office of Emergency Preparedness dates back, through its numerous predecessor agencies, more than 20 years. It has performed valuable functions in developing plans for emergency preparedness, in administering Federal disaster relief, and in overseeing and assisting the agencies in this area.</p>
<p class="note-body">OEP's work as a coordinating and supervisory authority in this field has in fact been so effective&mdash;particularly under the leadership of General George A. Lincoln, its director for the past four years, who retired earlier this month after an exceptional military and public service career&mdash;that the line departments and agencies which in the past have shared in the performance of the various preparedness functions now possess the capability to assume full responsibility for those functions. In the interest of efficiency and economy, we can now further streamline the Executive Office of the President by formally relocating those responsibilities and closing the Office of Emergency Preparedness.</p>
<p class="note-body">I propose to accomplish this reform in two steps. First, Reorganization Plan No. 1 would transfer to the President all functions previously vested by law in the Office or its Director, except the Director's role as a member of the National Security Council, which would be abolished; and it would abolish the Office of Emergency Preparedness.</p>
<p class="note-body">The functions to be transferred to the President from OEP are largely incidental to emergency authorities already vested in him. They include functions under the Disaster Relief Act of 1970 [42 U.S.C. 4401 et seq.]; the function of determining whether a major disaster has occurred within the meaning of (1) Section 7 of the Act of September 30, 1950, as amended, 20 U.S.C. 241&ndash;1, or (2) Section 762(a) of the Higher Education Act of 1965, as added by Section 161(a) of the Education Amendments of 1972, Public Law 92&ndash;318, 86 Stat. 288 at 299 (relating to the furnishing by the Commissioner of Education of disaster relief assistance for educational purposes) [20 U.S.C. 1132d&ndash;1]; and functions under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended <!-- PDFPage:4672 -->(19 U.S.C. 1862), with respect to the conduct of investigations to determine the effects on national security of the importation of certain articles.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Civil Defense Advisory Council within OEP would also be abolished by this plan, as changes in domestic and international conditions since its establishment in 1950 have now obviated the need for a standing council of this type. Should advice of the kind the Council has provided be required again in the future, State and local officials and experts in the field can be consulted on an ad hoc basis.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, as soon as the plan became effective, I would delegate OEP's former functions as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">All OEP responsibilities having to do with preparedness for and relief of civil emergencies and disasters would be transferred to the Department of Housing and Urban Development. This would provide greater field capabilities for coordination of Federal disaster assistance with that provided by States and local communities, and would be in keeping with the objective of creating a broad, new Department of Community Development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">OEP's responsibilities for measures to ensure the continuity of civil government operations in the event of major military attack would be reassigned to the General Services Administration, as would responsibility for resource mobilization including the management of national security stockpiles, with policy guidance in both cases to be provided by the National Security Council, and with economic considerations relating to changes in stockpile levels to be coordinated by the Council on Economic Policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Investigations of imports which might threaten the national security&mdash;assigned to OEP by Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 [19 U.S.C. 1862]&mdash;would be reassigned to the Treasury Department, whose other trade studies give it a readymade capability in this field; the National Security Council would maintain its supervisory role over strategic imports.</p>
<p class="note-body">Those disaster relief authorities which have been reserved to the President in the past, such as the authority to declare major disasters, will continue to be exercised by him under these new arrangements. In emergency situations calling for rapid interagency coordination, the Federal response will be coordinated by the Executive Office of the President under the general supervision of the Assistant to the President in charge of executive management.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Oil Policy Committee will continue to function as in the past, unaffected by this reorganization, except that I will designate the Deputy Secretary of the Treasury as chairman in place of the Director of OEP. The committee will operate under the general supervision of the Assistant to the President in charge of economic affairs.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">DECLARATIONS</h4>
<p class="note-body">After investigation, I have found that each action included in the accompanying plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in Section 901(a) of title 5 of the United States Code. In particular, the plan is responsive to the intention of the Congress as expressed in Section 901(a)(1), &ldquo;to promote better execution of the laws, more effective management of the executive branch and of its agencies and functions, and expeditious administration of the public business;&rdquo; and in Section 901(a)(3), &ldquo;to increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable;&rdquo; and in Section 901(a)(5), &ldquo;to reduce the number of agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and to abolish such agencies or functions as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">While it is not practicable to specify all of the expenditure reductions and other economies which will result from the actions proposed, personnel and budget savings from abolition of the National Aeronautics and Space Council and the Office of Science and Technology alone will exceed $2 million annually, and additional savings should result from a reduction of Executive Pay Schedule positions now associated with other transferred and delegated functions.</p>
<p class="note-body">The plan has as its one logically consistent subject matter the streamlining of the Executive Office of the President and the disposition of major responsibilities currently conducted in the Executive Office of the President, which can better be performed elsewhere or abolished.</p>
<p class="note-body">The functions which would be abolished by this plan, and the statutory authorities for each, are:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) the functions of the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness with respect to being a member of the National Security Council (Sec. 101, National Security Act of 1947, as amended, 50 U.S.C. 402; and Sec. 4, Reorganization Plan No. 1 of 1958);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) the functions of the Civil Defense Advisory Council (Sec. 102(a) Federal Civil Defense Act of 1950; 50 U.S.C. App. 2272(a)); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) the functions of the National Aeronautics and Space Council (Sec. 201, National Aeronautics and Space Act of 1958; 42 U.S.C. 2471).</p>
<p class="note-body">The proposed reorganization is a necessary part of the restructuring of the Executive Office of the President. It would provide through the Director of the National Science Foundation a strong focus for Federal efforts to encourage the development and application of science and technology to meet national needs. It would mean better preparedness for and swifter response to civil emergencies, and more reliable precautions against threats to the national security. The leaner and less diffuse Presidential staff structure which would result would enhance the President's ability to do his job and would advance the interests of the Congress as well.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am confident that this reorganization plan would significantly increase the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the Federal Government. I urge the Congress to allow it to become effective.</p>

<p class="note-body">(2) that DHS shall use its existing resources to coordinate and manage, rather than duplicate, other available resources;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) that implementation of this Order is accomplished with an economy of resources; and</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13151, Apr. 27, 2000, 65 F.R. 25619, as amended by Ex. Ord. No. 13284, &sect;5, Jan. 23, 2003, 68 F.R. 4075, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to establish a Global Disaster Information Network to use information technology more effectively to reduce loss of life and property from natural and man-made disasters, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. (a) It is the policy of this Administration to use information technology more effectively to coordinate the Federal Government's collection and dissemination of information to appropriate response agencies and State governments to prepare for and respond to natural and man-made disasters (disasters). As a result of changing population demographics in our coastal, rural, and urban areas over the past decades, the loss of life and property (losses) from disasters has nearly doubled. One of the ways the Federal Government can reduce these losses is to use technology more effectively to coordinate its collection and dissemination (hereafter referred to collectively as &ldquo;provision&rdquo;) of information which can be used in both planning for and recovering from disasters. While many agencies provide disaster-related information, they may not always provide it in a coordinated manner. To improve the provision of disaster-related information, the agencies shall, as set out in this order, use information technology to coordinate the Federal Government's provision of information to prepare for, respond to, and recover from domestic disasters.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) It is also the policy of this Administration to use information technology and existing channels of disaster assistance to improve the Federal Government's provision of information that could be helpful to foreign governments preparing for or responding to foreign disasters. Currently, the United States Government provides disaster-related information to foreign governments and relief organizations on humanitarian grounds at the request of foreign governments and where appropriate. This information is supplied by Federal agencies on an ad hoc basis. To increase the effectiveness of our response to foreign disasters, agencies shall, where appropriate, use information technology to coordinate the Federal Government's provision of disaster-related information to foreign governments.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4694 --><p class="note-body">(c) To carry out the policies in this order, there is established the Global Disaster Information Network (Network). The Network is defined as the coordinated effort by Federal agencies to develop a strategy and to use existing technical infrastructure, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of appropriations and under the guidance of the Interagency Coordinating Committee and the Committee Support Office, to make more effective use of information technology to assist our Government, and foreign governments where appropriate, by providing disaster-related information to prepare for and respond to disasters.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Establishment</em>. (a) There is established an Interagency Coordinating Committee (Committee) to provide leadership and oversight for the development of the Network. The Office of the Vice President, the Department of Commerce through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Department of State, respectively, shall designate a representative to serve as Co-chairpersons of the Committee. The Committee membership shall comprise representatives from the following departments and agencies:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The information revolution has transformed the conduct of business and the operations of government as well as the infrastructure relied upon for the defense and national security of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Private business, government, and the national security apparatus increasingly depend on an interdependent network of critical physical and information infrastructures, including telecommunications, energy, financial services, water, and transportation sectors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A continuous national effort is required to ensure the reliable provision of cyber and physical infrastructure services critical to maintaining the national defense, continuity of government, economic prosperity, and quality of life in the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4696 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) This national effort requires extensive modeling and analytic capabilities for purposes of evaluating appropriate mechanisms to ensure the stability of these complex and interdependent systems, and to underpin policy recommendations, so as to achieve the continuous viability and adequate protection of the critical infrastructure of the Nation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Policy of the United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that any physical or virtual disruption of the operation of the critical infrastructures of the United States be rare, brief, geographically limited in effect, manageable, and minimally detrimental to the economy, human and government services, and national security of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that actions necessary to achieve the policy stated in paragraph (1) be carried out in a public-private partnership involving corporate and non-governmental organizations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to have in place a comprehensive and effective program to ensure the continuity of essential Federal Government functions under all circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Establishment of national competence for critical infrastructure protection</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The support provided under paragraph (1) shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Modeling, simulation, and analysis of the systems comprising critical infrastructures, including cyber infrastructure, telecommunications infrastructure, and physical infrastructure, in order to enhance understanding of the large-scale complexity of such systems and to facilitate modification of such systems to mitigate the threats to such systems and to critical infrastructures generally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Acquisition from State and local governments and the private sector of data necessary to create and maintain models of such systems and of critical infrastructures generally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Utilization of modeling, simulation, and analysis under subparagraph (A) to provide education and training to policymakers on matters relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the analysis conducted under that subparagraph;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the implications of unintended or unintentional disturbances to critical infrastructures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) responses to incidents or crises involving critical infrastructures, including the continuity of government and private sector activities through and after such incidents or crises.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Utilization of modeling, simulation, and analysis under subparagraph (A) to provide recommendations to policymakers, and to departments and agencies of the Federal Government and private sector persons and entities upon request, regarding means of enhancing the stability of, and preserving, critical infrastructures.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Recipient of certain support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Modeling, simulation, and analysis provided under this subsection shall be provided, in particular, to relevant Federal, State, and local entities responsible for critical infrastructure protection and policy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Critical infrastructure defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;critical infrastructure&rdquo; means systems and assets, whether physical or virtual, so vital to the United States that the incapacity or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact on security, national economic security, national public health or safety, or any combination of those matters.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby authorized for the Department of Defense for fiscal year 2002, $20,000,000 for the Defense Threat Reduction Agency for activities of the National Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center under this section in that fiscal year.</p>
