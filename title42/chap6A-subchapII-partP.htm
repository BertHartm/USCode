<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;377, &sect;2, Oct. 30, 2004, 118 Stat. 2202, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Asthma is a chronic condition requiring lifetime, ongoing medical intervention.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 1980, 6,700,000 Americans had asthma.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In 2001, 20,300,000 Americans had asthma; 6,300,000 children under age 18 had asthma.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The prevalence of asthma among African-American children was 40 percent greater than among Caucasian children, and more than 26 percent of all asthma deaths are in the African-American population.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In 2000, there were 1,800,000 asthma-related visits to emergency departments (more than 728,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In 2000, there were 465,000 asthma-related hospitalizations (214,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In 2000, 4,487 people died from asthma, and of these 223 were children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asthma is a common cause of missed school days, accounting for approximately 14,000,000 missed school days annually.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) According to the New England Journal of Medicine, working parents of children with asthma lose an estimated $1,000,000,000 a year in productivity.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) At least 30 States have legislation protecting the rights of children to carry and self-administer asthma metered-dose inhalers, and at least 18 States expand this protection to epinephrine auto-injectors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Tragic refusals of schools to permit students to carry their inhalers and auto-injectable epinephrine have occurred, some resulting in death and spawning litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) School district medication policies must be developed with the safety of all students in mind. The immediate and correct use of asthma inhalers and auto-injectable epinephrine are necessary to avoid serious respiratory complications and improve health care outcomes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) No school should interfere with the patient-physician relationship.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Anaphylaxis, or anaphylactic shock, is a systemic allergic reaction that can kill within minutes. Anaphylaxis occurs in some asthma patients. According to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology, people who have experienced symptoms of anaphylaxis previously are at risk for subsequent reactions and should carry an epinephrine auto-injector with them at all times, if prescribed.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) An increasing number of students and school staff have life-threatening allergies. Exposure to the affecting allergen can trigger anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires prompt medical intervention with an injection of epinephrine.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;310, div. A, title VII, &sect;701, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1120, provided that: &ldquo;The purposes of this title [enacting this section] are to clarify the authority within the Public Health Service Act [this chapter] to authorize statewide newborn and infant hearing screening, evaluation and intervention programs and systems, technical assistance, a national applied research program, and interagency and private sector collaboration for policy development, in order to assist the States in making progress toward the following goals:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) All babies born in hospitals in the United States and its territories should have a hearing screening before leaving the birthing facility. Babies born in other countries and residing in the United States via immigration or adoption should have a hearing screening as early as possible.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) All babies who are not born in hospitals in the United States and its territories should have a hearing screening within the first 3 months of life.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Appropriate audiologic and medical evaluations should be conducted by 3 months for all newborns and infants suspected of having hearing loss to allow appropriate referral and provisions for audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early intervention before the age of 6 months.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) All newborn and infant hearing screening programs and systems should include a component for audiologic rehabilitation, medical and early intervention options that ensures linkage to any new and existing state-wide systems of intervention and rehabilitative services for newborns and infants with hearing loss.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Public policy in regard to newborn and infant hearing screening and intervention should be based on applied research and the recognition that newborns, infants, toddlers, and children who are deaf or hard-of-hearing have unique language, learning, and communication needs, and should be the result of consultation with pertinent public and private sectors.&rdquo;</p>
