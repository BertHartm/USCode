<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Asthma is a chronic condition requiring lifetime, ongoing medical intervention.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In 1980, 6,700,000 Americans had asthma.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In 2001, 20,300,000 Americans had asthma; 6,300,000 children under age 18 had asthma.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The prevalence of asthma among African-American children was 40 percent greater than among Caucasian children, and more than 26 percent of all asthma deaths are in the African-American population.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) In 2000, there were 1,800,000 asthma-related visits to emergency departments (more than 728,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In 2000, there were 465,000 asthma-related hospitalizations (214,000 of these involved children under 18 years of age).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In 2000, 4,487 people died from asthma, and of these 223 were children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, asthma is a common cause of missed school days, accounting for approximately 14,000,000 missed school days annually.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) According to the New England Journal of Medicine, working parents of children with asthma lose an estimated $1,000,000,000 a year in productivity.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Tragic refusals of schools to permit students to carry their inhalers and auto-injectable epinephrine have occurred, some resulting in death and spawning litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) School district medication policies must be developed with the safety of all students in mind.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) An increasing number of students and school staff have life-threatening allergies. Exposure to the affecting allergen can trigger anaphylaxis. Anaphylaxis requires prompt medical intervention with an injection of epinephrine.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to identify the causes and risk factors for congenital hearing loss;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to study the effectiveness of newborn and infant hearing screening, audiologic and medical evaluations and intervention programs and systems by assessing the health, intellectual and social developmental, cognitive, and language status of these children at school age; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to promote the sharing of data regarding early hearing loss with State-based birth defects and developmental disabilities monitoring programs for the purpose of identifying previously unknown causes of hearing loss.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) National Institutes of Health</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director of the National Institutes of Health, acting through the Director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders, shall for purposes of this section, continue a program of research and development on the efficacy of new screening techniques and technology, including clinical studies of screening methods, studies on efficacy of intervention, and related research.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Coordination and collaboration</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title V, &sect;501, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3023, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The health-related costs of intimate partner violence in the United States exceed $5,800,000,000 annually.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Thirty-seven percent of all women who sought care in hospital emergency rooms for violence-related injuries were injured by a current or former spouse, boyfriend, or girlfriend.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In addition to injuries sustained during violent episodes, physical and psychological abuse is linked to a number of adverse physical and mental health effects. Women who have been abused are much more likely to suffer from chronic pain, diabetes, depression, unintended pregnancies, substance abuse and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Health plans spend an average of $1,775 more a year on abused women than on general enrollees.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Each year about 324,000 pregnant women in the United States are battered by the men in their lives. This battering leads to complications of pregnancy, including low weight gain, anemia, infections, and first and second trimester bleeding.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Pregnant and recently pregnant women are more likely to be victims of homicide than to die of any other pregnancy-related cause, and evidence exists that a significant proportion of all female homicide victims are killed by their intimate partners.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Children who witness domestic violence are more likely to exhibit behavioral and physical health problems including depression, anxiety, and violence towards peers. They are also more likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away from home, engage in teenage prostitution, and commit sexual assault crimes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Recent research suggests that women experiencing domestic violence significantly increase their safety-promoting behaviors over the short- and long-term when health care providers screen for, identify, and provide followup care and information to address the violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Currently, only about 10 percent of primary care physicians routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during new patient visits and 9 percent routinely screen for intimate partner abuse during periodic checkups.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Recent clinical studies have proven the effectiveness of a 2-minute screening for early detection of abuse of pregnant women. Additional longitudinal studies have tested a 10-minute intervention that was proven highly effective in increasing the safety of pregnant abused women. Comparable research does not yet exist to support the effectiveness of screening men.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Seventy to 81 percent of the patients studied reported that they would like their healthcare providers to ask them privately about intimate partner violence.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Purpose</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title V, &sect;502, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3024, provided that: &ldquo;It is the purpose of this title [enacting this section, sections 294h and 13973 of this title, and provisions set out as a note above] to improve the health care system's response to domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking through the training and education of health care providers, developing comprehensive public health responses to violence against women and children, increasing the number of women properly screened, identified, and treated for lifetime exposure to violence, and expanding research on effective interventions in the health care setting.&rdquo;</p>
