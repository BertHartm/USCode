<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The total principal amount of new loans made and installments paid pursuant to lines of credit (as defined in section 292<em>o</em> of this title) to borrowers covered by Federal loan insurance under this subpart shall not exceed $350,000,000 for fiscal year 1993, $375,000,000 for fiscal year 1994, and $425,000,000 for fiscal year 1995. If the total amount of new loans made and installments paid pursuant to lines of credit in any fiscal year is less than the ceiling established for such year, the difference between the loans made and installments paid and the ceiling shall be carried over to the next fiscal year and added to the ceiling applicable to that fiscal year, and if in any fiscal year no ceiling has been established, any difference carried over shall constitute the ceiling for making new loans (including loans to new borrowers) and paying installments for such fiscal year. Thereafter, Federal loan insurance pursuant to this subpart may be granted only for loans made (or for loan installments paid pursuant to lines of credit) to enable students, who have obtained prior loans insured under this subpart, to continue or complete their educational program or to obtain a loan under section 292d(a)(1)(B) of this title to pay interest on such prior loans; but no insurance may be granted for any loan made or installment paid after September 30, 1998. The total principal amount of Federal loan insurance available under this subsection shall be granted by the Secretary without regard to any apportionment for the purpose of chapter 15 of title 31 and without regard to any similar limitation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certain limitations and priorities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitations regarding lenders, States, or areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may, if necessary to assure an equitable distribution of the benefits of this subpart, assign, within the maximum amounts specified in subsection (a) of this section, Federal loan insurance quotas applicable to eligible lenders, or to States or areas, and may from time to time reassign unused portions of these quotas.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Priority for certain lenders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In providing certificates of insurance under section 292e of this title through comprehensive contracts, the Secretary shall give priority to eligible lenders that agree&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to make loans to students at interest rates below the rates prevailing, during the period involved, for loans covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant to this subpart; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to make such loans under terms that are otherwise favorable to the student relative to the terms under which eligible lenders are generally making such loans during such period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authority of Student Loan Marketing Association</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the Student Loan Marketing Association, established under part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1071 et seq.], is authorized to make advances on the security of, purchase, service, sell, consolidate, or otherwise deal in loans which are insured by the Secretary under this subpart, except that if any loan made under this subpart is included in a consolidated loan pursuant to the authority of the Association under part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965, the interest rate on such consolidated loan shall be set at the weighted average interest rate of all such loans offered for consolidation and the resultant per centum shall be rounded downward to the nearest one-eighth of 1 per centum, except that the interest rate shall be no less than the applicable interest rate of the guaranteed student loan program established under part B of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965. In the case of such a consolidated loan, the borrower shall be responsible for any interest which accrues prior to the beginning of the repayment period of the loan, or which accrues during a period in which principal need not be paid (whether or not such principal is in fact paid) by reason of any provision of the Higher Education Act of 1965 [20 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Applicability of certain Federal regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to Federal regulations for lenders, this subpart may not be construed to preclude the applicability of such regulations to the Student Loan Marketing Association or to any other entity in the business of purchasing student loans, including such regulations with respect to applications, contracts, and due diligence.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;292e. Certificate of loan insurance; effective date of insurance</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority for issuance of certificate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, upon application by an eligible lender, made upon such form, containing such information, and supported by such evidence as the Secretary may require, and otherwise in conformity with this section, the Secretary finds that the applicant has made a loan to an eligible borrower which is insurable under the provisions of this subpart, he may issue to the applicant a certificate of insurance covering the loan and setting forth the amount and terms of the insurance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective date of insurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall become effective upon the date of issuance of the certificate, except that the Secretary is authorized, in accordance with regulations, to issue commitments with respect to proposed loans, or with respect to lines (or proposed lines) of credit, submitted by eligible lenders, and in that event, upon compliance with subsection (a)(1) of this section by the lender, the certificate of insurance may be issued effective as of the date when any loan, or any payment by the lender pursuant to a line of credit, to be covered by such insurance is made to a student described in section 292d(a)(1) of this title. Such insurance shall cease to be effective upon 60 days&rsquo; default by the lender in the payment of any installment of the premiums payable pursuant to section 292g of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain agreements for lenders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An application submitted pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an agreement by the applicant to pay, in accordance with regulations, the premiums fixed by the Secretary pursuant to section 292g of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an agreement by the applicant that if the loan is covered by insurance the applicant will submit such supplementary reports and statements during the effective period of the loan agreement, upon such forms, at such times, and containing such information as the Secretary may prescribe by or pursuant to regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority regarding comprehensive insurance coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In lieu of requiring a separate insurance application and issuing a separate certificate of insurance for each loan made by an eligible lender as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations consistent with section 292a of this title, issue to any eligible lender applying therefor a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage which shall, without further action by the Secretary, insure all insurable loans made by that lender, on or after the date <!-- PDFPage:679 -->of the certificate and before a specified cutoff date, within the limits of an aggregate maximum amount stated in the certificate. Such regulations may provide for conditioning such insurance, with respect to any loan, upon compliance by the lender with such requirements (to be stated or incorporated by reference in the certificate) as in the Secretary's judgment will best achieve the purpose of this subsection while protecting the financial interest of the United States and promoting the objectives of this subpart, including (but not limited to) provisions as to the reporting of such loans and information relevant thereto to the Secretary and as to the payment of initial and other premiums and the effect of default therein, and including provision for confirmation by the Secretary from time to time (through endorsement of the certificate) of the coverage of specific new loans by such certificate, which confirmation shall be incontestable by the Secretary in the absence of fraud or misrepresentation of fact or patent error.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Lines of credit beyond cutoff date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the holder of a certificate of comprehensive insurance coverage issued under this subsection grants to a borrower a line of credit extending beyond the cutoff date specified in that certificate, loans or payments thereon made by the holder after that date pursuant to the line of credit shall not be deemed to be included in the coverage of that certificate except as may be specifically provided therein; but, subject to the limitations of section 292a of this title, the Secretary may, in accordance with regulations, make commitments to insure such future loans or payments, and such commitments may be honored either as provided in subsection (a) of this section or by inclusion of such insurance in comprehensive coverage under this subsection for the period or periods in which such future loans or payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assignment of insurance rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The rights of an eligible lender arising under insurance evidenced by a certificate of insurance issued to it under this section may be assigned by such lender, subject to regulation by the Secretary, only to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) another eligible lender (including a public entity in the business of purchasing student loans); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Student Loan Marketing Association.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect of refinancing or consolidation of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The consolidation of the obligations of two or more federally insured loans obtained by a borrower in any fiscal year into a single obligation evidenced by a single instrument of indebtedness or the refinancing of a single loan shall not affect the insurance by the United States. If the loans thus consolidated are covered by separate certificates of insurance issued under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary may upon surrender of the original certificates issue a new certificate of insurance in accordance with that subsection upon the consolidated obligation. If the loans thus consolidated are covered by a single comprehensive certificate issued under subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary may amend that certificate accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rule of construction regarding consolidation of debts and refinancing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the lender and the borrower, by mutual agreement, from consolidating all of the borrower's loans insured under this subpart into a single instrument (or, if the borrower obtained only 1 loan insured under this subpart, refinancing the loan 1 time) under the terms applicable to an insured loan made at the same time as the consolidation. The lender or loan holder should provide full information to the borrower concerning the advantages and disadvantages of loan consolidation or refinancing. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude the consolidation of the borrower's loans insured under this subpart under section 1078&ndash;3 of title 20. Any loans insured pursuant to this subpart that are consolidated under section 1078&ndash;3 of title 20 shall not be eligible for special allowance payments under section 1087&ndash;1 of title 20.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;292f. Default of borrower</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions for payment to beneficiary</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon default by the borrower on any loan covered by Federal loan insurance pursuant to this subpart, and after a substantial collection effort (including, subject to subsection (h) of this section, commencement and prosecution of an action) as determined under regulations of the Secretary, the insurance beneficiary shall promptly notify the Secretary and the Secretary shall, if requested (at that time or after further collection efforts) by the beneficiary, or may on his own motion, if the insurance is still in effect, pay to the beneficiary the amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan as soon as that amount has been determined, except that, if the insurance beneficiary including any servicer of the loan is not designated for &ldquo;exceptional performance&rdquo;, as set forth in paragraph (2), the Secretary shall pay to the beneficiary a sum equal to 98 percent of the amount of the loss sustained by the insured upon that loan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Exceptional performance</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Secretary determines that an eligible lender, holder, or servicer has a compliance performance rating that equals or exceeds 97 percent, the Secretary shall designate that eligible lender, holder, or servicer, as the case may be, for exceptional performance.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Compliance performance rating</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), a compliance performance rating is determined with respect to compliance with due diligence in the disbursement, servicing, and collection of loans under this subpart for each year for which the determination is made. Such rating shall be equal to the percentage of all due diligence requirements applicable to each loan, on average, as established by the Secretary, with respect to loans serviced during the period by the eligible lender, holder, or servicer.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Annual audits for lenders, holders, and servicers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each eligible lender, holder, or servicer desiring a designation under subparagraph (A) shall have an annual financial and compliance audit conducted with respect to the loan portfolio of such eligible lender, holder, or servicer, by a qualified independent organization from a list of qualified organizations identified by the Secretary and in accordance with standards established by the Secretary. The standards shall measure the lender's, holder's, or servicer's compliance with due diligence standards and shall include a defined statistical sampling technique designed to measure the performance rating of the eligible lender, holder, or servicer for the purpose of this section. Each eligible lender, holder, or servicer shall submit the audit required by this section to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Secretary's determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall make the determination under subparagraph (A) based upon the audits submitted under this paragraph and any information in the possession of the Secretary or submitted by any other agency or office of the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Quarterly compliance audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To maintain its status as an exceptional performer, the lender, holder, or servicer shall undergo a quarterly compliance audit at the end of each quarter (other than the quarter in which status as an exceptional performer is established through a financial and compliance audit, as described in subparagraph (C)), and submit the results of such audit to the Secretary. The compliance audit shall review compliance with due diligence requirements for the period beginning on the day after the ending date of the previous audit, in accordance with standards determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall revoke the designation of a lender, holder, or servicer under subparagraph (A) if any quarterly audit required under subparagraph (E) is not received by the Secretary by the date established by the Secretary or if the audit indicates the lender, holder, or servicer has failed to meet the standards for designation as an exceptional performer under subparagraph (A). A lender, holder, or servicer receiving a compliance audit not meeting the standard for designation as an exceptional performer may reapply for designation under subparagraph (A) at any time.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Documentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this section shall restrict or limit the authority of the Secretary to require the submission of claims documentation evidencing servicing performed on loans, except that the Secretary may not require exceptional performers to submit greater documentation than that required for lenders, holders, and servicers not designated under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Cost of audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each eligible lender, holder, or servicer shall pay for all the costs associated with the audits required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(I) Additional revocation authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, a designation under subparagraph (A) may be revoked at any time by the Secretary if the Secretary determines that the eligible lender, holder, or servicer has failed to maintain an overall level of compliance consistent with the audit submitted by the eligible lender, holder, or servicer under this paragraph or if the Secretary asserts that the lender, holder, or servicer may have engaged in fraud in securing designation under subparagraph (A) or is failing to service loans in accordance with program requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(J) Noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A lender, holder, or servicer designated under subparagraph (A) that fails to service <!-- PDFPage:681 -->loans or otherwise comply with applicable program regulations shall be considered in violation of the Federal False Claims Act.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subrogation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon payment by the Secretary of the amount of the loss pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the United States shall be subrogated for all of the rights of the holder of the obligation upon the insured loan and shall be entitled to an assignment of the note or other evidence of the insured loan by the insurance beneficiary. If the net recovery made by the Secretary on a loan after deduction of the cost of that recovery (including reasonable administrative costs) exceeds the amount of the loss, the excess shall be paid over to the insured. The Secretary may sell without recourse to eligible lenders (or other entities that the Secretary determines are capable of dealing in such loans) notes or other evidence of loans received through assignment under the first sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Forbearance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this subpart shall be construed to preclude any forbearance for the benefit of the borrower which may be agreed upon by the parties to the insured loan and approved by the Secretary or to preclude forbearance by the Secretary in the enforcement of the insured obligation after payment on that insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reasonable care and diligence regarding loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or in this subpart shall be construed to excuse the eligible lender or holder of a federally insured loan from exercising reasonable care and diligence in the making of loans under the provisions of this subpart and from exercising a substantial effort in the collection of loans under the provisions of this subpart. If the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to an eligible lender, finds that the lender has failed to exercise such care and diligence, to exercise such substantial efforts, to make the reports and statements required under section 292e(a)(3) of this title, or to pay the required Federal loan insurance premiums, he shall disqualify that lender from obtaining further Federal insurance on loans granted pursuant to this subpart until he is satisfied that its failure has ceased and finds that there is reasonable assurance that the lender will in the future exercise necessary care and diligence, exercise substantial effort, or comply with such requirements, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the determination of the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the eligible lender or holder has made reasonable efforts to serve process on the borrower involved and has been unsuccessful with respect to such efforts, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Upon application by a person who received, and is under an obligation to repay, any loan made to such person as a health professions student to enable him to study medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, veterinary medicine, optometry, pharmacy, or podiatry, the Secretary may undertake to repay (without liability to the applicant) all or any part of such loan, and any interest or portion thereof outstanding thereon, upon his determination, pursuant to regulations establishing criteria therefor, that the applicant&mdash;</p>

A loan so referred shall be treated as a debt subject to section 5514 of title 5. Amounts collected shall be deposited in the school's student loan fund.
