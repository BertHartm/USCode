<p class="statutory-body">An offering employer shall provide free choice vouchers to each qualified employee of such employer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Offering employer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;offering employer&rdquo; means any employer who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) offers minimum essential coverage to its employees consisting of coverage through an eligible employer-sponsored plan; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;qualified employee&rdquo; means, with respect to any plan year of an offering employer, any employee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whose required contribution (as determined under section 5000A(e)(1)(B) of title 26)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18101_1_target" name="18101_1">1</a></sup> for minimum essential coverage through an eligible employer-sponsored plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) exceeds 8 percent of such employee's household income for the taxable year described in section 18082(b)(1)(B) of this title which ends with or within in&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18101_2_target" name="18101_2">2</a></sup> the plan year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not exceed 9.8 percent of such employee's household income for such taxable year;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) who does not participate in a health plan offered by the offering employer.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Indexing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any calendar year beginning after 2014, the Secretary shall adjust the 8 percent under paragraph (1)(A)(i) and 9.8 percent under paragraph (1)(A)(ii) for the calendar year to reflect the rate of premium growth between the preceding calendar year and 2013 over the rate of income growth for such period.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of any free choice voucher provided under subsection (a) shall be equal to the monthly portion of the cost of the eligible employer-sponsored plan which would have been paid by the employer if the employee were covered under the plan with respect to which the employer pays the largest portion of the cost of the plan. Such amount shall be equal to the amount the employer would pay for an employee with self-only coverage unless such employee elects family coverage (in which case such amount shall be the amount the employer would pay for family coverage).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment of excess amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount of the free choice voucher exceeds the amount of the premium of the qualified health plan in which the qualified employee is enrolled for such month, such excess shall be paid to the employee.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8159 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Other definitions</h4>
