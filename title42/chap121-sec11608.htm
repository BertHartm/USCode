<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may receive such information from a Federal or State department, agency, or instrumentality only pursuant to applicable Federal and State statutes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may transmit any information received under this subsection notwithstanding any provision of law other than this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requests for information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Requests for information under this section shall be submitted in such manner and form as the United States Central Authority may prescribe by regulation and shall be accompanied or supported by such documents as the United States Central Authority may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Responsibility of government entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of any State receives a request from the United States Central Authority for information authorized to be provided to such Central Authority under subsection (a) of this section, the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality shall promptly cause a search to be made of the files and records maintained by such department, agency, or instrumentality in order to determine whether the information requested is contained in any such files or records. If such search discloses the information requested, the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality shall immediately transmit such information to the United States Central Authority, except that any such information the disclosure of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) would adversely affect the national security interests of the United States or the law enforcement interests of the United States or of any State; or</p>
