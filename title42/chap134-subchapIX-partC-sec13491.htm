<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this part are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to require the Secretary to carry out civilian nuclear programs in a way that will lead toward the commercial availability of advanced nuclear reactor technologies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to authorize such activities to further the timely availability of advanced nuclear reactor technologies, including technologies that utilize standardized designs or exhibit passive safety features.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;advanced nuclear reactor technologies&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) advanced light water reactors that may be commercially available in the near-term, including but not limited to mid-sized reactors with passive safety features for the generation of commercial electric power from nuclear fission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) other advanced nuclear reactor technologies that may require prototype demonstration prior to commercial availability in the mid- or long-term, including but not limited to high-temperature, gas-cooled reactors and liquid metal reactors, for the generation of commercial electric power from nuclear fission;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;Commission&rdquo; means the Nuclear Regulatory Commission;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;standardized design&rdquo; means a design for a nuclear power plant that may be utilized for a multiple number of units or a multiple number of sites; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the term &ldquo;certification&rdquo; means approval by the Commission of a standardized design.</p>
