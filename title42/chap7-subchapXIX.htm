<p class="statutory-body">(B) Expenditures for which payments were made to the State under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as an overpayment to the extent that the State or local agency administering such plan has been reimbursed for such expenditures by a third party pursuant to the provisions of its plan in compliance with section 1396a(a)(25) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, when an overpayment is discovered, which was made by a State to a person or other entity, the State shall have a period of 60 days in which to recover or attempt to recover such overpayment before adjustment is made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (D), the adjustment in the Federal payment shall be made at the end of the 60 days, whether or not recovery was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any case where the State is unable to recover a debt which represents an overpayment (or any portion thereof) made to a person or other entity on account of such debt having been discharged in bankruptcy or otherwise being uncollectable, no adjustment shall be made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment (or portion thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the net amount recovered during any quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to medical assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply to any amount recovered or paid to a State as part of the comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between manufacturers of tobacco products, as defined in section 5702(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and State Attorneys General, or as part of any individual State settlement or judgment reached in litigation initiated or pursued by a State against one or more such manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Except as provided in subsection (i)(19) of this section, a State may use amounts recovered or paid to the State as part of a comprehensive or individual settlement, or a judgment, described in clause (i) for any expenditures determined appropriate by the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon the making of any estimate by the Secretary under this subsection, any appropriations available for payments under this section shall be deemed obligated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In any case in which the Secretary estimates that there has been an overpayment under this section to a State on the basis of a claim by such State that has been disallowed by the Secretary under section 1316(d) of this title, and such State disputes such disallowance, the amount of the Federal payment in controversy shall, at the option of the State, be retained by such State or recovered by the Secretary pending a final determination with respect to such payment amount. If such final determination is to the effect that any amount was properly disallowed, and the State chose to retain payment of the amount in controversy, the Secretary shall offset, from any subsequent payments made to such State under this subchapter, an amount equal to the proper amount of the disallowance plus interest on such amount disallowed for the period beginning on the date such amount was disallowed and ending on the date of such final determination at a rate (determined by the Secretary) based on the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day treasury bill auction rates during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Each State (as defined in subsection (w)(7)(D) of this section) shall include, in the first report submitted under paragraph (1) after the end of each fiscal year, information related to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A State plan approved under this subchapter may include, as a cost with respect to hospital services under the plan under this subchapter, periodic expenditures made to reflect transitional allowances established with respect to a hospital closure or conversion under section 1395uu of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (4), payment under the preceding provisions of this section shall not be made with respect to any amount expended as medical assistance in a calendar quarter, in any State, for any member of a family the annual income of which exceeds the applicable income limitation determined under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the applicable income limitation with respect to any family is the amount determined, in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, to be equivalent to 1331/3 percent of the highest amount which would ordinarily be paid to a family of the same size without any income or resources, in the form of money payments, under the plan of the State approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Each State plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may implement guidelines established by the Secretary, consistent with subsection (b) of this section, to identify those cases in which enrollment of an individual otherwise entitled to medical assistance under this subchapter in a group health plan (in which the individual is otherwise eligible to be enrolled) is cost-effective (as defined in subsection (e)(2) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may require, in case of an individual so identified and as a condition of the individual being or remaining eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter and subject to subsection (b)(2) of this section, notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, that the individual (or in the case of a child, the child's parent) apply for enrollment in the group health plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of such enrollment (except as provided in subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section), shall provide for payment of all enrollee premiums for such enrollment and all deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations for items and services otherwise covered under the State plan under this subchapter (exceeding the amount otherwise permitted under section 1396<em>o</em> of this title), and shall treat coverage under the group health plan as a third party liability (under section 1396a(a)(25) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Timing of enrollment; failure to enroll</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In establishing guidelines under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the Secretary shall take into account that an individual may only be eligible to enroll in group health plans at limited times and only if other individuals (not entitled to medical assistance under the plan) are also enrolled in the plan simultaneously.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If a parent of a child fails to enroll the child in a group health plan in accordance with subsection (a)(2) of this section, such failure shall not affect the child's eligibility for benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premiums considered payments for medical assistance; eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In the case of payments of premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations under this section shall be considered, for purposes of section 1396b(a) of this title, to be payments for medical assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If all members of a family are not eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter and enrollment of the members so eligible in a group health plan is not possible without also enrolling members not so eligible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) payment of premiums for enrollment of such other members shall be treated as payments for medical assistance for eligible individuals, if it would be cost-effective (taking into account payment of all such premiums), but</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) payment of deductibles, coinsurance, and other cost-sharing obligations for such other members shall not be treated as payments for medical assistance for eligible individuals.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The fact that an individual is enrolled in a group health plan under this section shall not change the individual's eligibility for benefits under the State plan, except insofar as section 1396a(a)(25) of this title provides that payment for such benefits shall first be made by such plan.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The term &ldquo;group health plan&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 5000(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and includes the provision of continuation coverage by such a plan pursuant to title XXII of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 300bb&ndash;1 et seq.], section 4980B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, or title VI&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396e_1_target" name="1396e_1">1</a></sup> of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;cost-effective&rdquo; means, as established by the Secretary, that the reduction in expenditures under this subchapter with respect to an individual who is enrolled in a group health plan is likely to be greater than the additional expenditures for premiums and cost-sharing required under this section with respect to such enrollment.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Nature of State program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of section 1396a(a)(29) of this title, a &ldquo;State program for the licensing of administrators of nursing homes&rdquo; is a program which provides that no nursing home within the State may operate except under the supervision of an administrator licensed in the manner provided in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Licensing by State agency or board representative of concerned professions and institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Licensing of nursing home administrators shall be carried out by the agency of the State responsible for licensing under the healing arts licensing act of the State, or, in the absence of such act or such an agency, a board representative of the professions and institutions concerned with care of chronically ill and infirm aged patients and established to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Functions and duties of State agency or board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the function and duty of such agency or board to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) develop, impose, and enforce standards which must be met by individuals in order to receive a license as a nursing home administrator, which standards shall be designed to insure that nursing home administrators will be individuals who are of good character and are otherwise suitable, and who, by training or experience in the field of institutional administration, are qualified to serve as nursing home administrators;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop and apply appropriate techniques, including examinations and investiga<!-- PDFPage:3018 -->tions, for determining whether an individual meets such standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) issue licenses to individuals determined, after the application of such techniques, to meet such standards, and revoke or suspend licenses previously issued by the board in any case where the individual holding any such license is determined substantially to have failed to conform to the requirements of such standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) establish and carry out procedures designed to insure that individuals licensed as nursing home administrators will, during any period that they serve as such, comply with the requirements of such standards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) receive, investigate, and take appropriate action with respect to, any charge or complaint filed with the board to the effect that any individual licensed as a nursing home administrator has failed to comply with the requirements of such standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) conduct a continuing study and investigation of nursing homes and administrators of nursing homes within the State with a view to the improvement of the standards imposed for the licensing of such administrators and of procedures and methods for the enforcement of such standards with respect to administrators of nursing homes who have been licensed as such.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of standards other than good character or suitability standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State shall be considered to have failed to comply with the provisions of section 1396a(a)(29) of this title because the agency or board of such State (established pursuant to subsection (b) of this section) shall have granted any waiver, with respect to any individual who, during all of the three calendar years immediately preceding the calendar year in which the requirements prescribed in section 1396a(a)(29) of this title are first met by the State, has served as a nursing home administrator, of any of the standards developed, imposed, and enforced by such agency or board pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Nursing home&rdquo; and &ldquo;nursing home administrator&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;nursing home&rdquo; means any institution or facility defined as such for licensing purposes under State law, or, if State law does not employ the term nursing home, the equivalent term or terms as determined by the Secretary, but does not include a religious nonmedical health care institution (as defined in section 1395x(ss)(1) of this title).<sup><a href="#1396g_1_target" name="1396g_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;nursing home administrator&rdquo; means any individual who is charged with the general administration of a nursing home whether or not such individual has an ownership interest in such home and whether or not his functions and duties are shared with one or more other individuals.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to share (through provision of additional services) with recipients of medical assistance under the State plan cost savings resulting from use by the recipient of more cost-effective medical care, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to restrict the provider from (or through) whom an individual (eligible for medical assistance under this subchapter) can obtain services (other than in emergency circumstances) to providers or practitioners who undertake to provide such services and who meet, accept, and comply with the reimbursement, quality, and utilization standards under the State plan, which standards shall be consistent with the requirements of section 1396r&ndash;4 of this title and are consistent with access, quality, and efficient and economic provision of covered care and services, if such restriction does not discriminate among classes of providers on grounds unrelated to their demonstrated effectiveness and efficiency in providing those services and if providers under such restriction are paid on a timely basis in the same manner as health care practitioners must be paid under section 1396a(a)(37)(A) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No waiver under this subsection may restrict the choice of the individual in receiving services under section 1396d(a)(4)(C) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) The hospital provides a referral to coordinate scheduling of this treatment.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application to exempt populations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an individual described in subsection (a)(2)(A) or who is not subject to cost sharing under subsection (b)(3)(B) with respect to non-emergency services described in paragraph (1), a State may impose cost sharing under paragraph (1) for care in an amount that does not exceed a nominal amount (as otherwise determined under section 1396<em>o</em> of this title) so long as no cost sharing is imposed to receive such care through an outpatient department or other alternative health care provider in the geographic area of the hospital emergency department involved.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Continued application of aggregate cap; relation to other cost sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In addition to the limitations imposed under subparagraphs (A) and (B), any cost sharing under paragraph (1) is subject to the aggregate cap on cost sharing applied under subsection (a)(2)(B) or under paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b), as the case may be. Cost sharing imposed for services under this subsection shall be instead of any cost sharing that may be imposed for such services under subsection (a) or section 1396<em>o</em> of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;alternative non-emergency services provider&rdquo; means, with respect to non-emergency services for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition, a health care provider, such as a physician's office, health care clinic, community health center, hospital outpatient department, or similar health care provider, that can provide clinically appropriate services for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition contemporaneously with the provision of the non-emergency services that would be provided in an emergency department of a hospital for the diagnosis or treatment of a condition, and that is participating in the program under this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Nursing facility&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this subchapter, the term &ldquo;nursing facility&rdquo; means an institution (or a distinct part of an institution) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is primarily engaged in providing to residents&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) skilled nursing care and related services for residents who require medical or nursing care,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) on a regular basis, health-related care and services to individuals who because of their mental or physical condition require care and services (above the level of room and board) which can be made available to them only through institutional facilities,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">and is not primarily for the care and treatment of mental diseases;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has in effect a transfer agreement (meeting the requirements of section 1395x(<em>l</em>) of this title) with one or more hospitals having agreements in effect under section 1395cc of this title; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Quality of life</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A nursing facility must care for its residents in such a manner and in such an environment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of each resident.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Quality assessment and assurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A nursing facility must maintain a quality assessment and assurance committee, consisting of the director of nursing services, a physician designated by the facility, and at least 3 other members of the facility's staff, which (i) meets at least quarterly to identify issues with respect to which quality assessment and assurance activities are necessary and (ii) develops and implements appropriate plans of action to correct identified quality deficiencies. A State or the Secretary may not require disclosure of the records of such committee except insofar as such disclosure is related to the compliance of such committee with the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of services and activities under plan of care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A nursing facility must provide services and activities to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident in accordance with a written plan of care which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) describes the medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of the resident and how such needs will be met;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is initially prepared, with the participation to the extent practicable of the resident or the resident's family or legal representative, by a team which includes the resident's attending physician and a registered professional nurse with responsibility for the resident; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is periodically reviewed and revised by such team after each assessment under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Residents&rsquo; assessment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A nursing facility must conduct a comprehensive, accurate, standardized, reproducible <!-- PDFPage:3060 -->assessment of each resident's functional capacity, which assessment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) describes the resident's capability to perform daily life functions and significant impairments in functional capacity;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) uses an instrument which is specified by the State under subsection (e)(5) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) includes the identification of medical problems.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each such assessment must be conducted or coordinated (with the appropriate participation of health professionals) by a registered professional nurse who signs and certifies the completion of the assessment. Each individual who completes a portion of such an assessment shall sign and certify as to the accuracy of that portion of the assessment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Penalty for falsification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) An individual who willfully and knowingly certifies under clause (i) a material and false statement in a resident assessment is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $1,000 with respect to each assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) An individual who willfully and knowingly causes another individual to certify under clause (i) a material and false statement in a resident assessment is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $5,000 with respect to each assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this clause in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Use of independent assessors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a State determines, under a survey under subsection (g) of this section or otherwise, that there has been a knowing and willful certification of false assessments under this paragraph, the State may require (for a period specified by the State) that resident assessments under this paragraph be conducted and certified by individuals who are independent of the facility and who are approved by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Frequency</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Such an assessment must be conducted&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The results of such an assessment shall be used in developing, reviewing, and revising the resident's plan of care under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such assessments shall be coordinated with any State-required preadmission screening program to the maximum extent practicable in order to avoid duplicative testing and effort. In addition, a nursing facility shall notify the State mental health authority or State mental retardation or developmental disability authority, as applicable, promptly after a significant change in the physical or mental condition of a resident who is mentally ill or mentally retarded.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Requirements relating to preadmission screening for mentally ill and mentally retarded individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in clauses (ii) and (iii) of subsection (e)(7)(A) of this section, a nursing facility must not admit, on or after January 1, 1989, any new resident who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is mentally ill (as defined in subsection (e)(7)(G)(i) of this section) unless the State mental health authority has determined (based on an independent physical and mental evaluation performed by a person or entity other than the State mental health authority) prior to admission that, because of the physical and mental condition of the individual, the individual requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility, and, if the individual requires such level of services, whether the individual requires specialized services for mental illness, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is mentally retarded (as defined in subsection (e)(7)(G)(ii) of this section) unless the State mental retardation or developmental disability authority has determined prior to admission that, because of the physical and mental condition of the individual, the individual requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility, and, if the individual requires such level of services, whether the individual requires specialized services for mental retardation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">A State mental health authority and a State mental retardation or developmental disability authority may not delegate (by subcontract or otherwise) their responsibilities under this subparagraph to a nursing facility (or to an entity that has a direct or indirect affiliation or relationship with such a facility).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3061 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Provision of services and activities</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Waiver by State</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the facility demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State that the facility has been unable, despite diligent efforts (including offering wages at the community prevailing rate for nursing facilities), to recruit appropriate personnel,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the State determines that a waiver of the requirement will not endanger the health or safety of individuals staying in the facility,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the State finds that, for any such periods in which licensed nursing services are not available, a registered professional nurse or a physician is obligated to respond immediately to telephone calls from the facility,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the State agency granting a waiver of such requirements provides notice of the waiver to the State long-term care ombudsman (established under section 307(a)(12)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396r_1_target" name="1396r_1">1</a></sup> of the Older Americans Act of 1965) and the protection and advocacy system in the State for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;A waiver under this clause shall be subject to annual review and to the review of the Secretary and subject to clause (iii) shall be accepted by the Secretary for purposes of this subchapter to the same extent as is the State's certification of the facility. In granting or renewing a waiver, a State may require the facility to use other qualified, licensed personnel.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Assumption of waiver authority by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the Secretary determines that a State has shown a clear pattern and practice of allowing waivers in the absence of diligent efforts by facilities to meet the staffing requirements, the Secretary shall assume and exercise the authority of the State to grant waivers.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Re-training required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), if, since an individual's most recent completion of a training and competency evaluation program, there has been a continuous period of 24 consecutive months during none of which the individual performed nursing or nursing-related services for monetary compensation, such individual shall complete a new training and competency evaluation program, or a new competency evaluation program.</p>

No individual shall serve as a member of a survey team unless the individual has successfully completed a training and testing program in survey and certification techniques that has been approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Validation surveys</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of nursing facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State's surveys conducted under paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the State has determined <!-- PDFPage:3075 -->that an individual nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to each State, the Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the number of nursing facilities surveyed by the State in the year, but in no case less than 5 nursing facilities in the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Reduction in administrative costs for substandard performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State's survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary may provide for the training of survey teams in the State and shall provide for a reduction of the payment otherwise made to the State under section 1396b(a)(2)(D) of this title with respect to a quarter equal to 33 percent multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities surveyed by the Secretary that quarter and the numerator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities which were found pursuant to such surveys to be not in compliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. A State that is dissatisfied with the Secretary's findings under this subparagraph may obtain reconsideration and review of the findings under section 1316 of this title in the same manner as a State may seek reconsideration and review under that section of the Secretary's determination under section 1316(a)(1) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special surveys of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a nursing facility with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the nursing facility meets such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Investigation of complaints and monitoring nursing facility compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) investigate complaints of violations of requirements by nursing facilities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) monitor, on-site, on a regular, as needed basis, a nursing facility's compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the facility has been found not to be in compliance with such requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies to achieve such compliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the facility was previously found not to be in compliance with such requirements, has corrected deficiencies to achieve such compliance, and verification of continued compliance is indicated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the State has reason to question the compliance of the facility with such requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A State may maintain and utilize a specialized team (including an attorney, an auditor, and appropriate health care professionals) for the purpose of identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence, and carrying out appropriate enforcement actions against substandard nursing facilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Disclosure of results of inspections and activities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Public information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) information respecting all surveys and certifications made respecting nursing facilities, including statements of deficiencies, within 14 calendar days after such information is made available to those facilities, and approved plans of correction,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall notify the State long-term care ombudsman (established under title III or VII of the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3021 et seq., 3058 et seq.] in accordance with section 712 of the Act [42 U.S.C. 3058g]) of the State's findings of noncompliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or of any adverse action taken against a nursing facility under paragraphs&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396r_4_target" name="1396r_4">4</a></sup> (1), (2), or (3) of subsection (h) of this section, with respect to a nursing facility in the State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any State board responsible for the licensing of the nursing facility administrator of the facility.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Access to fraud control units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall provide its State medicaid fraud and abuse control unit (established under section 1396b(q) of this title) with access to all information of the State agency responsible for surveys and certifications under this subsection.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3076 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Enforcement process</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) do both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to a State to remedy a nursing facility's deficiencies. If a State finds that a nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may provide for a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(A)(ii) for the days in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specified remedies</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Listing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B)(ii), each State shall establish by law (whether statute or regulation) at least the following remedies:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Denial of payment under the State plan with respect to any individual admitted to the nursing facility involved after such notice to the public and to the facility as may be provided for by the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the facility is or was out of compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty for activities described in subsections (b)(3)(B)(ii)(I), (b)(3)(B)(ii)(II), or (g)(2)(A)(i) of this section) shall be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the Secretary finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The appointment of temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility's residents, where there is a need for temporary management while&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) there is an orderly closure of the facility, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the State has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) The authority, in the case of an emergency, to close the facility, to transfer residents in that facility to other facilities, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the State may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deadline and guidance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), as a condition for approval of a State plan for calendar quarters beginning on or after October 1, 1989, each State shall establish the remedies described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A) by not later than October 1, 1989. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations by not later than October 1, 1988, guidance to States in establishing such remedies; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A State may establish alternative remedies (other than termination of participation) other than those described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A), if the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as those described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Assuring prompt compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a nursing facility has not complied with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, within 3 months after the date the facility is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the State shall impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i) for all individuals who are admitted to the facility after such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a nursing facility which, on 3 consecutive standard surveys conducted <!-- PDFPage:3077 -->under subsection (g)(2) of this section, has been found to have provided substandard quality of care, the State shall (regardless of what other remedies are provided)&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a nursing facility's deficiencies.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the Secretary, but not the State, finds that the facility's participation under the State plan should be terminated, the Secretary shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if the State, but not the Secretary, finds that the facility's participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State's decision to terminate, and timing of such termination, shall control; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) if the Secretary or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies which are additional or alternative to the remedy of terminating the facility's participation under the State plan, such additional or alternative remedies shall also be applied, or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Implementation of requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A State plan under this subchapter shall not be considered to meet the requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs), as of July 1, 1988, unless the State has submitted to the Secretary, by not later than such date, an amendment to such plan that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) specifically defines the hospitals so described (and includes in such definition any disproportionate share hospital described in subsection (b)(1) of this section which meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this section), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) provides, effective for inpatient hospital services provided not later than July 1, 1988, for an appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment for such services provided by such hospitals, consistent with subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In order to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, 1989, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1989, the State plan amendment described in paragraph (1), consistent with subsection (c) of this section, effective for inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1989.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In order to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, 1990, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1990, the State plan amendment described in paragraph (1), consistent with subsections (c) and (f) of this section, effective for inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a State plan under this subchapter provides for payments for inpatient hospital services on a prospective basis (whether per diem, per case, or otherwise), in order for the plan to be considered to have met such requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A) of this title as of July 1, <!-- PDFPage:3092 -->1989, the State must submit to the Secretary by not later than April 1, 1989, a State plan amendment that provides, in the case of hospitals defined by the State as disproportionate share hospitals under paragraph (1)(A), for an outlier adjustment in payment amounts for medically necessary inpatient hospital services provided on or after July 1, 1989, involving exceptionally high costs or exceptionally long lengths of stay for individuals under one year of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A State plan under this subchapter shall not be considered to meet the requirements of section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals that serve a disproportionate number of low-income patients with special needs), as of October 1, 1998, unless the State has submitted to the Secretary by such date a description of the methodology used by the State to identify and to make payments to disproportionate share hospitals, including children's hospitals, on the basis of the proportion of low-income and medicaid patients (including such patients who receive benefits through a managed care entity) served by such hospitals. The State shall provide an annual report to the Secretary describing the disproportionate share payments to each such disproportionate share hospital.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall, not later than 90 days after the date a State submits an amendment under this subsection, review each such amendment for compliance with such requirement and by such date shall approve or disapprove each such amendment. If the Secretary disapproves such an amendment, the State shall immediately submit a revised amendment which meets such requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The requirement of this subsection may not be waived under section 1396n(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Hospitals deemed disproportionate share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(1) of this section, a hospital which meets the requirements of subsection (d) of this section is deemed to be a disproportionate share hospital if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the hospital's medicaid inpatient utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (2)) is at least one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the hospital's low-income utilization rate (as defined in paragraph (3)) exceeds 25 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the term &ldquo;medicaid inpatient utilization rate&rdquo; means, for a hospital, a fraction (expressed as a percentage), the numerator of which is the hospital's number of inpatient days attributable to patients who (for such days) were eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter in a period (regardless of whether such patients receive medical assistance on a fee-for-service basis or through a managed care entity), and the denominator of which is the total number of the hospital's inpatient days in that period. In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;inpatient day&rdquo; includes each day in which an individual (including a newborn) is an inpatient in the hospital, whether or not the individual is in a specialized ward and whether or not the individual remains in the hospital for lack of suitable placement elsewhere.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the term &ldquo;low-income utilization rate&rdquo; means, for a hospital, the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the fraction (expressed as a percentage)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the sum (for a period) of (I) the total revenues paid the hospital for patient services under a State plan under this subchapter (regardless of whether the services were furnished on a fee-for-service basis or through a managed care entity) and (II) the amount of the cash subsidies for patient services received directly from State and local governments, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the total amount of revenues of the hospital for patient services (including the amount of such cash subsidies) in the period; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction (expressed as a percentage)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the numerator of which is the total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospital services which are attributable to charity care in a period, less the portion of any cash subsidies described in clause (i)(II) of subparagraph (A) in the period reasonably attributable to inpatient hospital services, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the denominator of which is the total amount of the hospital's charges for inpatient hospital services in the hospital in the period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The numerator under subparagraph (B)(i) shall not include contractual allowances and discounts (other than for indigent patients not eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not restrict a State's authority to designate hospitals as disproportionate share hospitals under this section. The previous sentence shall not be construed to affect the authority of the Secretary to reduce payments pursuant to section 1396b(w)(1)(A)(iii) of this title if the Secretary determines that, as a result of such designations, there is in effect a hold harmless provision described in section 1396b(w)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payment adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsections (f) and (g) of this section, in order to be consistent with this subsection, a payment adjustment for a disproportionate share hospital must either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be in an amount equal to at least the product of (A) the amount paid under the State plan to the hospital for operating costs for inpatient hospital services (of the kind described in section 1395ww(a)(4) of this title), and (B) the hospital's disproportionate share adjustment percentage (established under section 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(iv) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for a minimum specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) and (without regard to whether the hospital is described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section) for an increase in such a payment amount (or per<!-- PDFPage:3093 -->centage payment) in proportion to the percentage by which the hospital's medicaid utilization rate (as defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section) exceeds one standard deviation above the mean medicaid inpatient utilization rate for hospitals receiving medicaid payments in the State or the hospital's low-income utilization rate (as defined in paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396r-4_1_target" name="1396r-4_1">1</a></sup> (b)(3) of this section); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide for a minimum specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) that varies according to type of hospital under a methodology that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) applies equally to all hospitals of each type; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) results in an adjustment for each type of hospital that is reasonably related to the costs, volume, or proportion of services provided to patients eligible for medical assistance under a State plan approved under this subchapter or to low-income patients,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that, for purposes of paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(A) of subsection (a) of this section, the payment adjustment for a disproportionate share hospital is consistent with this subsection if the appropriate increase in the rate or amount of payment is equal to at least one-third of the increase otherwise applicable under this subsection (in the case of such paragraph (1)(B)) and at least two-thirds of such increase (in the case of paragraph (2)(A)). In the case of a hospital described in subsection (d)(2)(A)(i) of this section (relating to children's hospitals), in computing the hospital's disproportionate share adjustment percentage for purposes of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the disproportionate patient percentage (defined in section 1395ww(d)(5)(F)(vi) of this title) shall be computed by substituting for the fraction described in subclause (I) of such section the fraction described in subclause (II) of that section. If a State elects in a State plan amendment under subsection (a) of this section to provide the payment adjustment described in paragraph (2), the State must include in the amendment a detailed description of the specific methodology to be used in determining the specified additional payment amount (or increased percentage payment) to be made to each hospital qualifying for such a payment adjustment and must publish at least annually the name of each hospital qualifying for such a payment adjustment and the amount of such payment adjustment made for each such hospital.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirements to qualify as disproportionate share hospital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), no hospital may be defined or deemed as a disproportionate share hospital under a State plan under this subchapter or under subsection (b) of this section unless the hospital has at least 2 obstetricians who have staff privileges at the hospital and who have agreed to provide obstetric services to individuals who are entitled to medical assistance for such services under such State plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to a hospital&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the inpatients of which are predominantly individuals under 18 years of age; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) which does not offer nonemergency obstetric services to the general population as of December 22, 1987.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a hospital located in a rural area (as defined for purposes of section 1395ww of this title), in paragraph (1) the term &ldquo;obstetrician&rdquo; includes any physician with staff privileges at the hospital to perform nonemergency obstetric procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No hospital may be defined or deemed as a disproportionate share hospital under a State plan under this subchapter or under subsection (b) or (e) of this section unless the hospital has a medicaid inpatient utilization rate (as defined in subsection (b)(2) of this section) of not less than 1 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A State plan shall be considered to meet the requirement of section 1396a(a)(13)(A)(iv) of this title (insofar as it requires payments to hospitals to take into account the situation of hospitals which serve a disproportionate number of low income patients with special needs) without regard to the requirement of subsection (a) of this section if (A)(i) the plan provided for payment adjustments based on a pooling arrangement involving a majority of the hospitals participating under the plan for disproportionate share hospitals as of January 1, 1984, or (ii) the plan as of January 1, 1987, provided for payment adjustments based on a statewide pooling arrangement involving all acute care hospitals and the arrangement provides for reimbursement of the total amount of uncompensated care provided by each participating hospital, (B) the aggregate amount of the payment adjustments under the plan for such hospitals is not less than the aggregate amount of such adjustments otherwise required to be made under such subsection, and (C) the plan meets the requirement of subsection (d)(3) of this section and such payment adjustments are made consistent with the last sentence of subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of a State that used a health insuring organization before January 1, 1986, to administer a portion of its plan on a statewide basis, beginning on July 1, 1988&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the requirements of subsections (b) and (c) of this section (other than the last sentence of subsection (c) of this section) shall not apply if the aggregate amount of the payment adjustments under the plan for disproportionate share hospitals (as defined under the State plan) is not less than the aggregate amount of payment adjustments otherwise required to be made if such subsections applied,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if payment of income is made in the names of the institutionalized spouse and the community spouse, one-half of the income shall be considered available to each of them; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) if payment of income is made in the names of the institutionalized spouse or the community spouse, or both, and to another person or persons, the income shall be considered available to each spouse in proportion to the spouse's interest (or, if payment is made with respect to both spouses and no such interest is specified, one-half of the joint interest shall be considered available to each spouse).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Rebutting ownership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The rules of subparagraphs (A) and (C) are superseded to the extent that an institutionalized spouse can establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the ownership interests in income are other than as provided under such subparagraphs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rules for treatment of resources</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Computation of spousal share at time of institutionalization</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Total joint resources</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total value of the resources to the extent either the institutionalized spouse or the community spouse has an ownership interest, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a spousal share which is equal to 1/2 of such total value.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">At the request of an institutionalized spouse or community spouse, at the beginning of the first continuous period of institutionalization (beginning on or after September 30, 1989) of the institutionalized spouse and upon the receipt of relevant documentation of resources, the State shall promptly assess and document the total value described in subparagraph (A)(i) and shall provide a copy of such assessment and documentation to each spouse and shall retain a copy of the assessment for use under this section. If the request is not part of an application for medical assistance under this subchapter, the State may, at its option as a condition of providing the assessment, require payment of a fee not exceeding the reasonable expenses of providing and documenting the assessment. At the time of providing the copy of the assessment, the State shall include a notice indicating that the spouse will have a right to a fair hearing under subsection (e)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Attribution of resources at time of initial eligibility determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the resources of an institutionalized spouse at the time of application for benefits under this subchapter, regardless of any State laws relating to community property or the division of marital property&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) except as provided in subparagraph (B), all the resources held by either the institutionalized spouse, community spouse, or both, shall be considered to be available to the institutionalized spouse, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) resources shall be considered to be available to an institutionalized spouse, but only to the extent that the amount of such resources exceeds the amount computed under subsection (f)(2)(A) of this section (as of the time of application for benefits).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assignment of support rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The institutionalized spouse shall not be ineligible by reason of resources determined under paragraph (2) to be available for the cost of care where&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the institutionalized spouse lacks the ability to execute an assignment due to physical or mental impairment but the State has the right to bring a support proceeding against a community spouse without such assignment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the State determines that denial of eligibility would work an undue hardship.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Separate treatment of resources after eligibility for benefits established</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the continuous period in which an institutionalized spouse is in an institution and after the month in which an institutionalized spouse is determined to be eligible for benefits under this subchapter, no resources of the community spouse shall be deemed available to the institutionalized spouse.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Revision of community spouse resource allowance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If either such spouse establishes that the community spouse resource allowance (in relation to the amount of income generated by such an allowance) is inadequate to raise the community spouse's income to the minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance, there shall be substituted, for the community spouse resource allowance under subsection (f)(2) of this section, an amount adequate to provide such a minimum monthly maintenance needs allowance.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement for rebate agreement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order for payment to be available under section 1396b(a) of this title or under part B of subchapter XVIII of this chapter for covered outpatient drugs of a manufacturer, the manufacturer must have entered into and have in effect a rebate agreement described in subsection (b) of this section with the Secretary, on behalf of States (except that, the Secretary may authorize a State to enter directly into agreements with a manufacturer), and must meet the requirements of paragraph (5) (with respect to drugs purchased by a covered entity on or after the first day of the first month <!-- PDFPage:3113 -->that begins after November 4, 1992) and paragraph (6). Any agreement between a State and a manufacturer prior to April 1, 1991, shall be deemed to have been entered into on January 1, 1991, and payment to such manufacturer shall be retroactively calculated as if the agreement between the manufacturer and the State had been entered into on January 1, 1991. If a manufacturer has not entered into such an agreement before March 1, 1991, such an agreement, subsequently entered into, shall become effective as of the date on which the agreement is entered into or, at State option, on any date thereafter on or before the first day of the calendar quarter that begins more than 60 days after the date the agreement is entered into.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall first apply to drugs dispensed under this subchapter on or after January 1, 1991.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authorizing payment for drugs not covered under rebate agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1), and section 1396b(i)(10)(A) of this title, shall not apply to the dispensing of a single source drug or innovator multiple source drug if (A)(i) the State has made a determination that the availability of the drug is essential to the health of beneficiaries under the State plan for medical assistance; (ii) such drug has been given a rating of 1&ndash;A by the Food and Drug Administration; and (iii)(I) the physician has obtained approval for use of the drug in advance of its dispensing in accordance with a prior authorization program described in subsection (d) of this section, or (II) the Secretary has reviewed and approved the State's determination under subparagraph (A); or (B) the Secretary determines that in the first calendar quarter of 1991, there were extenuating circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Effect on existing agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a rebate agreement in effect between a State and a manufacturer on November 5, 1990, such agreement, for the initial agreement period specified therein, shall be considered to be a rebate agreement in compliance with this section with respect to that State, if the State agrees to report to the Secretary any rebates paid pursuant to the agreement and such agreement provides for a minimum aggregate rebate of 10 percent of the State's total expenditures under the State plan for coverage of the manufacturer's drugs under this subchapter. If, after the initial agreement period, the State establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that an agreement in effect on November 5, 1990, provides for rebates that are at least as large as the rebates otherwise required under this section, and the State agrees to report any rebates under the agreement to the Secretary, the agreement shall be considered to be a rebate agreement in compliance with the section for the renewal periods of such agreement.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation on prices of drugs purchased by covered entities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Agreement with Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A manufacturer meets the requirements of this paragraph if the manufacturer has entered into an agreement with the Secretary that meets the requirements of section 256b of this title with respect to covered outpatient drugs purchased by a covered entity on or after the first day of the first month that begins after November 4, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Covered entity&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this subsection, the term &ldquo;covered entity&rdquo; means an entity described in section 256b(a)(4) of this title and a children's hospital described in section 1395ww(d)(1)(B)(iii) of this title which meets the requirements of clauses (i) and (iii) of section 256b(b)(4)(L)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396r-8_1_target" name="1396r-8_1">1</a></sup> of this title and which would meet the requirements of clause (ii) of such section if that clause were applied by taking into account the percentage of care provided by the hospital to patients eligible for medical assistance under a State plan under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Establishment of alternative mechanism to ensure against duplicate discounts or rebates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary does not establish a mechanism under section 256b(a)(5)(A) of this title within 12 months of November 4, 1992, the following requirements shall apply:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each covered entity shall inform the single State agency under section 1396a(a)(5) of this title when it is seeking reimbursement from the State plan for medical assistance described in section 1396d(a)(12) of this title with respect to a unit of any covered outpatient drug which is subject to an agreement under section 256b(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) State agency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each such single State agency shall provide a means by which a covered entity shall indicate on any drug reimbursement claims form (or format, where electronic claims management is used) that a unit of the drug that is the subject of the form is subject to an agreement under section 256b of this title, and not submit to any manufacturer a claim for a rebate payment under subsection (b) of this section with respect to such a drug.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Effect of subsequent amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining whether an agreement under subparagraph (A) meets the requirements of section 256b of this title, the Secretary shall not take into account any amendments to such section that are enacted after November 4, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Determination of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A manufacturer is deemed to meet the requirements of this paragraph if the manufacturer establishes to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the manufacturer would comply (and has offered to comply) with the provisions of section 256b of this title (as in effect immediately after November 4, 1992) and would have entered into an agreement under <!-- PDFPage:3114 -->such section (as such section was in effect at such time), but for a legislative change in such section after November 4, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Requirements relating to master agreements for drugs procured by Department of Veterans Affairs and certain other Federal agencies</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Requirement for submission of utilization data for certain physician administered drugs</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Single source drugs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In order for payment to be available under section 1396b(a) of this title for a covered outpatient drug that is a single source drug that is physician administered under this subchapter (as determined by the Secretary), and that is administered on or after January 1, 2006, the State shall provide for the collection and submission of such utilization data and coding (such as J-codes and National Drug Code numbers) for each such drug as the Secretary may specify as necessary to identify the manufacturer of the drug in order to secure rebates under this section for drugs administered for which payment is made under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Multiple source drugs</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Identification of most frequently physician administered multiple source drugs</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Use of NDC codes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than January 1, 2007, the information shall be submitted under subparagraphs (A) and (B)(ii) using National Drug Code codes unless the Secretary specifies that an alternative coding system should be used.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Hardship waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may delay the application of subparagraph (A) or (B)(ii), or both, in the case of a State to prevent hardship to States which require additional time to implement the reporting system required under the respective subparagraph.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to meet the requirement of section 1396a(a)(62) of this title, each State shall establish a pediatric vaccine distribution program (which may be administered by the State department of health), consistent with the requirements of this section, under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) each vaccine-eligible child (as defined in subsection (b) of this section), in receiving an immunization with a qualified pediatric vaccine (as defined in subsection (h)(8) of this section) from a program-registered provider (as defined in subsection (c) of this section) on or after October 1, 1994, is entitled to receive the immunization without charge for the cost of such vaccine; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) each program-registered provider who administers such a pediatric vaccine to a vaccine-eligible child on or after such date is entitled to receive such vaccine under the program without charge either for the vaccine or its delivery to the provider, and (ii) no vaccine is distributed under the program to a provider unless the provider is a program-registered provider.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Delivery of sufficient quantities of pediatric vaccines to immunize federally vaccine-eligible children</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall provide under subsection (d) of this section for the purchase and delivery on behalf of each State meeting the requirement of section 1396a(a)(62) of this title (or, with respect to vaccines administered by an Indian tribe or tribal organization to Indian children, directly to the tribe or organization), without charge to the State, of such quantities of qualified pediatric vaccines as may be necessary for the administration of such vaccines to all federally vaccine-eligible children in the State on or after October 1, 1994. This paragraph constitutes budget authority in advance of appropriations Acts, and represents the obligation of the Federal Government to provide for the purchase and delivery to States of the vaccines (or payment under subparagraph (C)) in accordance with this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rules where vaccine is unavailable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that a sufficient quantity of a vaccine is not available for purchase or delivery under subsection (d) of this section, the Secretary shall provide for the purchase and delivery of the available vaccine in accordance with priorities established by the Secretary, with priority given to federally vaccine-eligible children unless the Secretary finds there are other public health considerations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rules where State is a manufacturer</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Payments in lieu of vaccines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a State that manufactures a pediatric vaccine the Secretary, instead of providing the vaccine on behalf of a State under subparagraph (A), shall provide to the State an amount equal to the value of the quantity of such vaccine that otherwise would have been delivered on behalf of the State under such subparagraph, but only if the State agrees that such payments will only be used for purposes relating to pediatric immunizations.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Determination of value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the amount to pay a State under clause (i) with respect to a pediatric vaccine, the value of the quantity of vaccine shall be determined on the basis of the price in effect for the qualified pediatric vaccine under contracts under subsection (d) of this section. If more than 1 such contract is in effect, the Secretary shall determine such value on the basis of the average of the prices under the contracts, after weighting each such price in relation to the quantity of vaccine under the contract involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Vaccine-eligible children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;vaccine-eligible child&rdquo; means a child who is a federally vaccine-eligible child (as defined in paragraph (2)) or a State vaccine-eligible child (as defined in paragraph (3)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Federally vaccine-eligible child</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;federally vaccine-eligible child&rdquo; means any of the following children:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) A medicaid-eligible child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) A child who is not insured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) A child who (I) is administered a qualified pediatric vaccine by a federally-qualified health center (as defined in section 1396d(<em>l</em>)(2)(B) of this title) or a rural health clinic (as defined in section 1396d(<em>l</em>)(1) of this title), and (II) is not insured with respect to the vaccine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) A child who is an Indian (as defined in subsection (h)(3) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In subparagraph (A):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The term &ldquo;medicaid-eligible&rdquo; means, with respect to a child, a child who is entitled to medical assistance under a state&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396s_1_target" name="1396s_1">1</a></sup> plan approved under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The term &ldquo;insured&rdquo; means, with respect to a child&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3130 --><p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), that the child is enrolled under, and entitled to benefits under, a health insurance policy or plan, including a group health plan, a prepaid health plan, or an employee welfare benefit plan under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 [29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii)(II) with respect to a pediatric vaccine, that the child is entitled to benefits under such a health insurance policy or plan, but such benefits are not available with respect to the cost of the pediatric vaccine.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State vaccine-eligible child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;State vaccine-eligible child&rdquo; means, with respect to a State and a qualified pediatric vaccine, a child who is within a class of children for which the State is purchasing the vaccine pursuant to subsection (d)(4)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program-registered providers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this section, except as otherwise provided, the term &ldquo;program-registered provider&rdquo; means, with respect to a State, any health care provider that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is licensed or otherwise authorized for administration of pediatric vaccines under the law of the State in which the administration occurs (subject to section 254f(e) of this title), without regard to whether or not the provider participates in the plan under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) submits to the State an executed provider agreement described in paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) has not been found, by the Secretary or the State, to have violated such agreement or other applicable requirements established by the Secretary or the State consistent with this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Provider agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A provider agreement for a provider under this paragraph is an agreement (in such form and manner as the Secretary may require) that the provider agrees as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) Before administering a qualified pediatric vaccine to a child, the provider will ask a parent of the child such questions as are necessary to determine whether the child is a vaccine-eligible child, but the provider need not independently verify the answers to such questions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The provider will, for a period of time specified by the Secretary, maintain records of responses made to the questions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The provider will, upon request, make such records available to the State and to the Secretary, subject to section 1396a(a)(7) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) Subject to clause (ii), the provider will comply with the schedule, regarding the appropriate periodicity, dosage, and contraindications applicable to pediatric vaccines, that is established and periodically reviewed and, as appropriate, revised by the advisory committee referred to in subsection (e) of this section, except in such cases as, in the provider's medical judgment subject to accepted medical practice, such compliance is medically inappropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The provider will provide pediatric vaccines in compliance with applicable State law, including any such law relating to any religious or other exemption.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) In administering a qualified pediatric vaccine to a vaccine-eligible child, the provider will not impose a charge for the cost of the vaccine. A program-registered provider is not required under this section to administer such a vaccine to each child for whom an immunization with the vaccine is sought from the provider.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The provider may impose a fee for the administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine so long as the fee in the case of a federally vaccine-eligible child does not exceed the costs of such administration (as determined by the Secretary based on actual regional costs for such administration).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The provider will not deny administration of a qualified pediatric vaccine to a vaccine-eligible child due to the inability of the child's parent to pay an administration fee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Encouraging involvement of providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each program under this section shall provide, in accordance with criteria established by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for encouraging the following to become program-registered providers: private health care providers, the Indian Health Service, health care providers that receive funds under title V of the Indian Health Care Improvement Act [25 U.S.C. 1651 et seq.], and health programs or facilities operated by Indian tribes or tribal organizations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for identifying, with respect to any population of vaccine-eligible children a substantial portion of whose parents have a limited ability to speak the English language, those program-registered providers who are able to communicate with the population involved in the language and cultural context that is most appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) State requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as the Secretary may permit in order to prevent fraud and abuse and for related purposes, a State may not impose additional qualifications or conditions, in addition to the requirements of paragraph (1), in order that a provider qualify as a program-registered provider under this section. This subsection does not limit the exercise of State authority under section 1396n(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Negotiation of contracts with manufacturers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of meeting obligations under this section, the Secretary shall negotiate and enter into contracts with manufacturers of pediatric vaccines consistent with the requirements of this subsection and, to the maximum extent practicable, consolidate such contracting with any other contracting activities conducted by the Secretary to purchase vaccines. The Secretary may enter into such <!-- PDFPage:3131 -->contracts under which the Federal Government is obligated to make outlays, the budget authority for which is not provided for in advance in appropriations Acts, for the purchase and delivery of pediatric vaccines under subsection (a)(2)(A) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to contracts entered into under this subsection for a pediatric vaccine for which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a contract in effect under section 247b(j)(1) of this title as of May 1, 1993, no price for the purchase of such vaccine for vaccine-eligible children shall be agreed to by the Secretary under this subsection if the price per dose of such vaccine (including delivery costs and any applicable excise tax established under section 4131 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) exceeds the price per dose for the vaccine in effect under such a contract as of such date increased by the percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers (all items; United States city average) from May 1993 to the month before the month in which such contract is entered into.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Negotiation of discounted price for new vaccines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to contracts entered into for a pediatric vaccine not described in subparagraph (B), the price for the purchase of such vaccine shall be a discounted price negotiated by the Secretary that may be established without regard to such subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Quantities and terms of delivery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Under such contracts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary shall provide, consistent with paragraph (6), for the purchase and delivery on behalf of States (and tribes and tribal organizations) of quantities of pediatric vaccines for federally vaccine-eligible children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) each State, at the option of the State, shall be permitted to obtain additional quantities of pediatric vaccines (subject to amounts specified to the Secretary by the State in advance of negotiations) through purchasing the vaccines from the manufacturers at the applicable price negotiated by the Secretary consistent with paragraph (3), if (i) the State agrees that the vaccines will be used to provide immunizations only for children who are not federally vaccine-eligible children and (ii) the State provides to the Secretary such information (at a time and manner specified by the Secretary, including in advance of negotiations under paragraph (1)) as the Secretary determines to be necessary, to provide for quantities of pediatric vaccines for the State to purchase pursuant to this subsection and to determine annually the percentage of the vaccine market that is purchased pursuant to this section and this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary shall enter into the initial negotiations under the preceding sentence not later than 180 days after August 10, 1993.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Charges for shipping and handling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may enter into a contract referred to in paragraph (1) only if the manufacturer involved agrees to submit to the Secretary such reports as the Secretary determines to be appropriate to assure compliance with the contract and if, with respect to a State program under this section that does not provide for the direct delivery of qualified pediatric vaccines, the manufacturer involved agrees that the manufacturer will provide for the delivery of the vaccines on behalf of the State in accordance with such program and will not impose any charges for the costs of such delivery (except to the extent such costs are provided for in the price established under paragraph (3)).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Assuring adequate supply of vaccines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, in negotiations under paragraph (1), shall negotiate for quantities of pediatric vaccines such that an adequate supply of such vaccines will be maintained to meet unanticipated needs for the vaccines. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall negotiate for a 6-month supply of vaccines in addition to the quantity that the Secretary otherwise would provide for in such negotiations. In carrying out this paragraph, the Secretary shall consider the potential for outbreaks of the diseases with respect to which the vaccines have been developed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Multiple suppliers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of the pediatric vaccine involved, the Secretary shall, as appropriate, enter into a contract referred to in paragraph (1) with each manufacturer of the vaccine that meets the terms and conditions of the Secretary for an award of such a contract (including terms and conditions regarding safety and quality). With respect to multiple contracts entered into pursuant to this paragraph, the Secretary may have in effect different prices under each of such contracts and, with respect to a purchase by States pursuant to paragraph (4)(B), the Secretary shall determine which of such contracts will be applicable to the purchase.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of pediatric vaccines list</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall use, for the purpose of the purchase, delivery, and administration of pediatric vaccines under this section, the list established (and periodically reviewed and as appropriate revised) by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (an advisory committee <!-- PDFPage:3132 -->established by the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Requirement of State maintenance of immunization laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a State that had in effect as of May 1, 1993, a law that requires some or all health insurance policies or plans to provide some coverage with respect to a pediatric vaccine, a State program under this section does not comply with the requirements of this section unless the State certifies to the Secretary that the State has not modified or repealed such law in a manner that reduces the amount of coverage so required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section, and the requirement of section 1396a(a)(62) of this title, shall cease to be in effect beginning on such date as may be prescribed in Federal law providing for immunization services for all children as part of a broad-based reform of the national health care system.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special reviews of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a provider of home or community care with any of the requirements of subsection (f) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a review of the provider and, on the basis of that review, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the provider meets such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Surveys of community care settings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The certification under this subsection with respect to community care settings must be based on a survey.

Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a community care setting of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Validation surveys of community care settings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of community care settings in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under subparagraph (A) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State's surveys conducted under subparagraph (A). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under subparagraph (B). If the State has determined that an individual setting meets the requirements of subsection (g) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the setting does not meet such requirements, the Secretary's determination as to the setting's noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Special surveys of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a community care setting with any of the requirements of subsection (g) or (h) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the setting and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the setting meets such requirements.</p>

Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting <!-- PDFPage:3138 -->the remedies available to a State to remedy a provider's deficiencies.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Civil money penalty</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each State shall establish by law (whether statute or regulation) at least the following remedy: A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the provider is or was out of compliance with a requirement of this section. Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty under subsection (i)(3)(A) of this section) may be applied to reimbursement of individuals for personal funds lost due to a failure of home or community care providers to meet the requirements of this section.

The Secretary shall provide, through regulations or otherwise by not later than July 1, 1990, guidance to States in establishing such remedy; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedy.</p>

The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.

After such 5-year period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that a State demonstration program previously implemented has been unsuccessful, such a demonstration program may be extended or made permanent in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that all State demonstration programs previously implemented were unsuccessful, other States may implement State demonstration programs.</p>
