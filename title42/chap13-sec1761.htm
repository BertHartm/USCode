<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall also study the administrative costs of service institutions participating in the program and shall thereafter prescribe maximum allowable levels for administrative payments that reflect the costs of such service institutions, taking into account the number of sites and children served, and such other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate to further the goals of efficient and effective administration of the program.</p>

The State shall forward any remaining payment due a service institution not later than seventy-five days following receipt of valid claims. If the State has reason to believe that a service institution will not be able to submit a valid claim for reimbursement covering the period for which an advance program payment has been made, the subsequent month's advance program payment shall be withheld until such time as the State has received a valid claim. Program payments advanced to service institutions that are not subsequently deducted from a valid claim for reimbursement shall be repaid upon demand by the State.

To assure meal quality, States shall, with the assistance of the Secretary, prescribe model meal specifications and model food quality standards, and ensure that all service institutions contracting for the preparation of meals with food service management companies include in their contracts menu cycles, local food safety standards, and food quality standards approved by the State. Such contracts shall require (A) periodic inspections, by an independent agency or the local health department for the locality in which the meals are served, of meals prepared in accordance with the contract in order to determine bacteria levels present in such meals, and (B) that bacteria levels conform to the standards which are applied by the local health authority for that locality with respect to the levels of bacteria that may be present in meals served by other establishments in that locality.

If the Secretary finds that the State has failed without good cause to meet any of the Secretary's standards or has failed without good cause to carry out the approved State management and administration plan under subsection (n) of this section, the Secretary may withhold from the State such funds authorized under this subsection as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To provide for adequate nutritional and food quality monitoring, and to further the implementation of the program, an additional amount, not to exceed the lesser of actual costs or 1 percent of program funds, shall be made available by the Secretary to States to pay for State or local health department inspections, and to reinspect facilities and deliveries to test meal quality.</p>

The Secretary shall prescribe additional conditions and limitations governing assignment of all or any part of a contract entered into by a food service management company under this section. Any food service management company shall, in its bid, provide the service institution information as to its meal capacity. The State shall, upon award of any bid, review the company's registration to calculate how many remaining meals the food service management company is equipped to prepare.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each State shall provide for the registration of food service management companies. For the purposes of this section, registration shall include, at a minimum&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, positive efforts shall be made by service institutions to use small businesses and minority-owned businesses as sources of supplies and services. Such efforts shall afford those sources the maximum feasible opportunity to compete for contracts using program funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Each State, with the assistance of the Secretary, shall establish a standard form of contract for use by service institutions and food service management companies. The Secretary shall prescribe requirements governing bid and contract procedures for acquisition of the services of food service management companies, including, but not limited to, bonding requirements (which may provide exemptions applicable to contracts of $100,000 or less), procedures for review of contracts by States, and safeguards to prevent collusive bidding activities between service institutions and food service management companies.</p>
