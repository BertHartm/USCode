<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Specific assurances in license for pretermination actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any license issued or renewed after the effective date of this section under section 2092 or section 2111 of this title for any activity which results in the production of any byproduct material, as defined in section 2014(e)(2) of this title, shall contain such terms and conditions as the Commission determines to be necessary to assure that, prior to termination of such license&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3232 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the licensee will comply with decontamination, decommissioning, and reclamation standards prescribed by the Commission for sites (A) at which ores were processed primarily for their source material content and (B) at which such byproduct material is deposited, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) ownership of any byproduct material, as defined in section 2014(e)(2) of this title, which resulted from such licensed activity shall be transferred to (A) the United States or (B) in the State in which such activity occurred if such State exercises the option under subsection (b)(1) of this section to acquire land used for the disposal of byproduct material.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any license which is in effect on the effective date of this section and which is subsequently terminated without renewal shall comply with paragraphs (1) and (2) upon termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfer of title; health and environmental protection through maintenance of property and materials; use of surface or subsurface estates: first refusal rights of transferor; maintenance, monitoring, and emergency measures and other authorized action; licensee-transferor liability for fraud or negligence; administrative and legal costs limitation; government retransfers under section 7914(h) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Commission shall require by rule, regulation, or order that prior to the termination of any license which is issued after the effective date of this section, title to the land, including any interests therein (other than land owned by the United States or by a State) which is used for the disposal of any byproduct material, as defined by section 2014(e)(2) of this title, pursuant to such license shall be transferred to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the United States, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the State in which such land is located, at the option of such State,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless the Commission determines prior to such termination that transfer of title to such land and such byproduct material is not necessary or desirable to protect the public health, safety, or welfare or to minimize or eliminate danger to life or property. Such determination shall be made in accordance with section 2231 of this title. Notwithstanding any other provision of law or any such determination, such property and materials shall be maintained pursuant to a license issued by the Commission pursuant to section 2111 of this title in such manner as will protect the public health, safety, and the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Commission determines by order that use of the surface or subsurface estates, or both, of the land transferred to the United States or to a State under subparagraph (A) would not endanger the public health, safety, welfare, or environment, the Commission, pursuant to such regulations as it may prescribe, shall permit the use of the surface or subsurface estates, or both, of such land in a manner consistent with the provisions of this section. If the Commission permits such use of such land, it shall provide the person who transferred such land with the right of first refusal with respect to such use of such land.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If transfer to the United States of title to such byproduct material and such land is required under this section, the Secretary of Energy or any Federal agency designated by the President shall, following the Commission's determination of compliance under subsection (c) of this section, assume title and custody of such byproduct material and land transferred as provided in this subsection. Such Secretary or Federal agency shall maintain such material and land in such manner as will protect the public health and safety and the environment. Such custody may be transferred to another officer or instrumentality of the United States only upon approval of the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If transfer to a State of title to such byproduct material is required in accordance with this subsection, such State shall, following the Commission's determination of compliance under subsection (d) of this section, assume title and custody of such byproduct material and land transferred as provided in this subsection. Such State shall maintain such material and land in such manner as will protect the public health, safety, and the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of any such license under section 2092 of this title, which was in effect on the effective date of this section, the Commission may require, before the termination of such license, such transfer of land and interests therein (as described in paragraph (1) of this subsection) to the United States or a State in which such land is located, at the option of such State, as may be necessary to protect the public health, welfare, and the environment from any effects associated with such byproduct material. In exercising the authority of this paragraph, the Commission shall take into consideration the status of the ownership of such land and interests therein and the ability of the licensee to transfer title and custody thereof to the United States or a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission may, pursuant to a license, or by rule or order, require the Secretary or other Federal agency or State having custody of such property and materials to undertake such monitoring, maintenance, and emergency measures as are necessary to protect the public health and safety and such other actions as the Commission deems necessary to comply with the standards promulgated pursuant to section 2114 of this title. The Secretary or such other Federal agency is authorized to carry out maintenance, monitoring, and emergency measures, but shall take no other action pursuant to such license, rule or order, with respect to such property and materials unless expressly authorized by Congress after November 8, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The transfer of title to land or byproduct materials, as defined in section 2014(e)(2) of this title, to a State or the United States pursuant to this subsection shall not relieve any licensee of liability for any fraudulent or negligent acts done prior to such transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Material and land transferred to the United States or a State in accordance with this subsection shall be transferred without cost to the United States or a State (other than administrative and legal costs incurred in carrying out such transfer). Subject to the provisions of paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection, the United <!-- PDFPage:3233 -->States or a State shall not transfer title to material or property acquired under this subsection to any person, unless such transfer is in the same manner as provided under section 7914(h) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The provisions of this subsection respecting transfer of title and custody to land shall not apply in the case of lands held in trust by the United States for any Indian tribe or lands owned by such Indian tribe subject to a restriction against alienation imposed by the United States. In the case of such lands which are used for the disposal of byproduct material, as defined in section 2014(e)(2) of this title, the licensee shall be required to enter into such arrangements with the Commission as may be appropriate to assure the long-term maintenance and monitoring of such lands by the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compliance with applicable standards and license requirements; determination upon termination of license</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon termination on&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2113_1_target" name="2113_1">1</a></sup> any license to which this section applies, the Commission shall determine whether or not the licensee has complied with all applicable standards and requirements under such license.</p>
