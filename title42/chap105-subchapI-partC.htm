<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the amount of the loan, together with other funds available, is adequate to assure completion of the project or achievement of the purposes for which the loan is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Loans made by the Secretary pursuant to this section shall bear interest at a rate not less than a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury taking into consideration the average market yield on outstanding Treasury obligations of comparable maturity, plus such additional charge, if any, toward covering other costs of the program as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may determine to be consistent with its purposes, except that, for the 5 years following the date in which funds are initially available to the borrower, the rate of interest shall be set at a rate considered appropriate by the Secretary in light of the particular needs of the borrower, which rate shall not be lower than 1 percent. All such loans shall be repayable within a period of not more than 30 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Adjustment of interest rates, moratorium on principal and interest, etc.</h4>

The capital of each such revolving fund shall remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Rural Development Loan Fund shall consist of the remaining funds provided for in part A of title III of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964 [42 U.S.C. 2841 et seq.], as in effect on September 19, 1972, and such amounts as may be deposited in such fund by the Secretary out of funds made available from appropriations for purposes of carrying out this part.

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Community Development Loan Fund shall consist of such amounts as may be deposited in such fund by the Secretary out of funds made available from appropriations for purposes of carrying out this subchapter.
