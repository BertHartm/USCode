<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a child who would cease to receive medical assistance because of subparagraph (A) but who may be eligible for assistance under the State plan because the child is described in clause (i) of section 1396d(a) of this title or clause (i)(IV), (i)(VI)(i)(VII),,<sup><a href="#1396r-6_1_target" name="1396r-6_1">1</a></sup> or (ii)(IX) of section 1396a(a)(10)(A) of this title, the State may not discontinue such assistance under such subparagraph until the State has determined that the child is not eligible for assistance under the plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State, at its option, may pay a family's expenses for premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and similar costs for health insurance or other health coverage offered by an employer of the caretaker relative or by an employer of the absent parent of a dependent child. In the case of such coverage offered by an employer of the caretaker relative&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the State may require the caretaker relative, as a condition of extension of coverage under this subsection for the caretaker and the caretaker's family, to make application for such employer coverage, but only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the State provides, directly or otherwise, for payment of any of the premium amount, deductible, coinsurance, or similar expense that the employee is otherwise required to pay; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Reporting requirements</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) During initial extension period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each State shall require (as a condition for additional extended assistance under this subsection) that a family receiving extended assistance under subsection (a) of this section report to the State, not later than the 21st day of the 4th month in the period of extended assistance under subsection (a) of this section, on the family's gross monthly earnings and on the fami<!-- PDFPage:2115 -->ly's costs for such child care as is necessary for the employment of the caretaker relative in each of the first 3 months of that period.

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) During additional extension period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each State shall require that a family receiving extended assistance under this subsection report to the State, not later than the 21st day of the 1st month and of the 4th month in the period of additional extended assistance under this subsection, on the family's gross monthly earnings and on the family's costs for such child care as is necessary for the employment of the caretaker relative in each of the 3 preceding months.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Clarification on frequency of reporting</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) No dependent child</h4>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Failure to pay any premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the family fails to pay any premium for a month under paragraph (5) by the 21st day of the following month, the extension shall terminate at the close of that following month, unless the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to pay such premium on a timely basis.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Quarterly income reporting and test</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The extension under this subsection shall terminate at the close of the 1st or 4th month of the 6-month period if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the family fails to report to the State, by the 21st day of such month, the information required under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), unless the family has established, to the satisfaction of the State, good cause for the failure to report on a timely basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the caretaker relative had no earnings in one or more of the previous 3 months, unless such lack of any earnings was due to an involuntary loss of employment, illness, or other good cause, established to the satisfaction of the State; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Information described in clause (iii)(I) shall be subject to the restrictions on use and disclosure of information provided under section 602(a)(9) of this title. Instead of terminating a family's extension under clause (iii)(I), a State, at its option, may provide for suspension of the extension until the month after the month in which the family reports information required under paragraph (2)(B)(ii), but only if the family's extension has not otherwise been terminated under subclause (II) or (III) of clause (iii). The State shall make determinations under clause (iii)(III) for a family each time a report under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) for the family is received.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice before termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No termination of assistance shall become effective under subparagraph (A) until the State has provided the family with notice of the grounds for the termination, which notice shall include (in the case of termination under subparagraph (A)(iii)(II), relating to no continued earnings) a description of how the family may reestablish eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan. No such termination shall be effective earlier than 10 days after the date of mailing of such notice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">With respect to an individual who would cease to receive medical assistance because of clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) but who may be eligible for assistance under the State plan because the individual is within a category of person for which medical assistance under the State <!-- PDFPage:2116 -->plan is available under section 1396a(a)(10)(C) of this title (relating to medically needy individuals), the State may not discontinue such assistance under such subparagraph until the State has determined that the individual is not eligible for assistance under the plan.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If a State elects to offer an option to enroll a family under this subparagraph, the State shall pay any premiums and other costs for such enrollment imposed on the family and may pay deductibles and coinsurance imposed on the family.
