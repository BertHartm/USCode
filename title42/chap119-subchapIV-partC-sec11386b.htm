<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Minimum allocation for permanent housing for homeless individuals and families with disabilities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the amounts made available to carry out this part for a fiscal year, a portion equal to not less than 30 percent of the sums made available to carry out part B and this part, shall be used for permanent housing for homeless individuals with disabilities and homeless families that include such an individual who is an adult or a minor head of household if no adult is present in the household.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Calculation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In calculating the portion of the amount described in paragraph (1) that is used for activities that are described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall not count funds made available to renew contracts for existing projects under section 11386c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The 30 percent figure in paragraph (1) shall be reduced proportionately based on need under section 11386a(b)(2) of this title in geographic areas for which subsection (e) applies in regard to subsection (d)(2)(A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirement established in paragraph (1) shall be suspended for any year in which funding available for grants under this part after making the allocation established in paragraph (1) would not be sufficient to renew for 1 year all existing grants that would otherwise be fully funded under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirement established in paragraph (1) shall terminate upon a finding by the Secretary that since the beginning of 2001 at least 150,000 new units of permanent housing for homeless individuals and families with disabilities have been funded under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Set-aside for permanent housing for homeless families with children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From the amounts made available to carry out this part for a fiscal year, a portion equal to not less than 10 percent of the sums made available to carry out part B and this part for that fiscal year shall be used to provide or secure permanent housing for homeless families with children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment of amounts for permanent or transitional housing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter may be construed to establish a limit on the amount of funding that an applicant may request under this part for acquisition, construction, or rehabilitation activities for the development of permanent housing or transitional housing.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Incentives for proven strategies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide bonuses or other incentives to geographic areas for using funding under this part for activities that have been proven to be effective at reducing homelessness generally, reducing homelessness for a specific subpopulation, or achieving homeless prevention and independent living goals as set forth in section 11386a(b)(1)(F) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, activities that have been proven to be effective at reducing homelessness generally or reducing homelessness for a specific subpopulation includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless individuals and families;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for homeless families, rapid rehousing services, short-term flexible subsidies to overcome barriers to rehousing, support services concentrating on improving incomes to pay rent, coupled with performance measures emphasizing rapid and permanent rehousing and with leveraging funding from mainstream family service systems such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Child Welfare services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) any other activity determined by the Secretary, based on research and after notice and comment to the public, to have been proven effective at reducing homelessness generally, reducing homelessness for a specific subpopulation, or achieving homeless prevention and independent living goals as set forth in section 11386a(b)(1)(F) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Balance of incentives for proven strategies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To the extent practicable, in providing bonuses or incentives for proven strategies, the Secretary shall seek to maintain a balance among strategies targeting homeless individuals, families, and other subpopulations. The Secretary shall not implement bonuses or incentives that specifically discourage collaborative applicants from exercising their flexibility to serve families with children and youth defined as homeless under other Federal statutes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Incentives for successful implementation of proven strategies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any geographic area demonstrates that it has fully implemented any of the activities described in subsection (d) for all homeless individuals and families or for all members of subpopulations for whom such activities are targeted, that geographic area shall receive the bonus or incentive provided under subsection (d), but may use such bonus or incentive for any eligible activity under either section 11383 of this title or paragraphs (4) and (5) of section 11374(a) of this title for homeless people generally or for the relevant subpopulation.</p>
