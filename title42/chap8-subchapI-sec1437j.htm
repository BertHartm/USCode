<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, a reduction in benefits as a result of the expiration of a lifetime time limit for a family receiving welfare or public assistance benefits shall not be considered to be a failure to comply with the conditions under the assistance program requiring participation in an economic self-sufficiency program or imposing a work activities requirement. This paragraph shall apply beginning on October 21, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of fraud</h4>

This paragraph shall apply beginning on October 21, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraphs (2) and (3) shall not apply to any covered family before the public housing agency providing assistance under this chapter on behalf of the family obtains written notification from the relevant welfare or public assistance agency specifying that the family's benefits have been reduced because of noncompliance with economic self-sufficiency program or work activities requirements or fraud, and the level of such reduction.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Occupancy rights</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This subsection may not be construed to authorize any public housing agency to establish any time limit on tenancy in a public housing dwelling unit or on receipt of tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any covered family residing in public housing that is affected by the operation of this subsection shall have the right to review the determination under this subsection through the administrative grievance procedure established pursuant to section 1437d(k) of this title for the public housing agency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Cooperation agreements for economic self-sufficiency activities</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Confidentiality</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Treatment of income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in determining the income of a family who resides in public housing or receives tenant-based assistance under section 1437f of this title, a public housing agency shall consider any decrease in the income of a family that results from the reduction of any welfare or public assistance benefits received by the family under any Federal, State, or local law regarding a program for such assistance if the family (or a member thereof, as applicable) has complied with the conditions for receiving such assistance and is unable to obtain employment notwithstanding such compliance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;economic self-sufficiency program&rdquo; means any program designed to encourage, assist, train, or facilitate the economic independence of participants and their families or to provide work for participants, including programs for job training, employment counseling, work placement, basic skills training, education, workfare, financial or household management, apprenticeship, or other activities as the Secretary may provide.</p>
