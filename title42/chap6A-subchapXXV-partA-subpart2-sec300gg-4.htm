<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to stay in the hospital for a fixed period of time following the birth of her child.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This section shall not apply with respect to any group health plan, or any group health insurance coverage offered by a health insurance issuer, which does not provide benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or her newborn child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a group health plan or issuer from imposing deductibles, coinsurance, or other cost-sharing in relation to benefits for hospital lengths of stay in connection with childbirth for a mother or newborn child under the plan (or under health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan), except that such coinsurance or other cost-sharing for any portion of a period within a hospital length of stay required under subsection (a) of this section may not be greater than such coinsurance or cost-sharing for any preceding portion of such stay.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Preemption; exception for health insurance coverage in certain States</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of this section shall not apply with respect to health insurance coverage if there is a State law (as defined in section 300gg&ndash;23(d)(1) of this title) for a State that regulates such coverage that is described in any of the following subparagraphs:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Such State law requires such coverage to provide for at least a 48-hour hospital length of stay following a normal vaginal delivery and at least a 96-hour hospital length of stay following a cesarean section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Such State law requires such coverage to provide for maternity and pediatric care in accordance with guidelines established by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, or other established professional medical associations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Such State law requires, in connection with such coverage for maternity care, that the hospital length of stay for such care is left to the decision of (or required to be made by) the attending provider in consultation with the mother.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Section 300gg&ndash;23(a)(1) of this title shall not be construed as superseding a State law described in paragraph (1).</p>
