<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of Commerce shall make appropriate adjustments to the annual Current Population Survey conducted by the Bureau of the Census in order to produce statistically reliable annual State data on the number of low-income children who do not have health insurance coverage, so that real changes in the uninsurance rates of children can reasonably be detected. The Current Population Survey should produce data under this subsection that categorizes such children by family income, age, and race or ethnicity. The adjustments made to produce such data shall include, where appropriate, expanding the sample size used in the State sampling units, expanding the number of sampling units in a State, and an appropriate verification element.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Additional requirements</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Assess whether American Community Survey estimates, once such survey data are first available, produce more reliable estimates than the Current Population Survey with respect to the purposes described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) On the basis of the assessment required under subparagraph (D), recommend to the Secretary of Health and Human Services whether American Community Survey estimates should be used in lieu of, or in some combination with, Current Population Survey estimates for the purposes described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Continue making the adjustments described in the last sentence of paragraph (1) with respect to expansion of the sample size used in State sampling units, the number of sampling units in a State, and using an appropriate verification element.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authority for the Secretary of Health and Human Services to transition to the use of all, or some combination of, ACS estimates upon recommendation of the Secretary of Commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, on the basis of the assessment required under paragraph (2)(D), the Secretary of Commerce recommends to the Secretary of Health and Human Services that American Community Survey estimates should be used in lieu of, or in some combination with, Current Population Survey estimates for the purposes described in paragraph (2)(B), the Secretary of Health and Human Services, in consultation with the States, may provide for a period during which the Secretary may transition from carrying out such purposes through the use of Current Population Survey estimates to the use of American Community Survey estimates (in lieu of, or in combination with the Current Population Survey estimates, as recommended), provided that any such transition is implemented in a manner that is designed to avoid adverse impacts upon States with approved State child health plans under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, there are appropriated $20,000,000 for fiscal year 2009 and each fiscal year thereafter for the purpose of carrying out this subsection (except that only with respect to fiscal year 2008, there are appropriated $20,000,000 for the purpose of carrying out this subsection, to remain available until expended).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) who satisfies the requirements of paragraphs (1)(A), (1)(C), (2), and (3) of section 1397jj(b) of this title in the same manner as a child applying for child health assistance would have to satisfy such requirements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If a child is born to a targeted low-income pregnant woman who was receiving pregnancy-related assistance under this section on the date of the child's birth, the child shall be deemed to have applied for child health assistance under the State child health plan and to have been found eligible for such assistance under such plan or to have applied for medical assistance under subchapter XIX and to have been found eligible for such assistance under such subchapter, as appropriate, on the date of such birth and to remain eligible for such assistance until the child attains 1 year of age.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No inference</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed&mdash;</p>
