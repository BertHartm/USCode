<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) In amounts of payment expended for certain State-funded health insurance programs for children</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Flexibility in submittal of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section or subsections (e) and (f) of section 1397dd of this title shall be construed as preventing a State from claiming as expenditures in the quarter expenditures that were incurred in a previous quarter.</p>
