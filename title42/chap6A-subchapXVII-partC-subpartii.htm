<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to dispense methadone for treatment purposes to individuals who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) meet the conditions for admission to such programs that dispense methadone as part of comprehensive treatment for such dependence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are seeking admission to such programs that so dispense methadone, but as a result of the limited capacity of the programs, will not gain such admission until 14 or more days after seeking admission to the programs; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in dispensing methadone to such individuals, to provide only minimum ancillary services during the period in which the individuals are waiting for admission to programs of comprehensive treatment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The preponderance of scientific research indicates that the medically supervised dispensing of methadone is not an effective method of reducing the extent of dependence on heroin and other morphine-like drugs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The preponderance of available data indicates that, of treatment programs that dispense methadone as part of comprehensive treatment, a substantial majority admit all individuals seeking services to the programs not later than 14 days after the individuals seek admission to the programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under paragraph (1) shall provide that the Secretary may not provide an authorization described in such paragraph to any treatment program in a State unless the chief public health officer of the State has certified to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such officer does not object to the provision of such authorizations to treatment programs in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the provision of interim maintenance services in the State will not reduce the capacity of comprehensive treatment programs in the State to admit individuals to the programs (relative to the date on which such officer so certifies).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Date certain for issuance of regulations; failure of Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall issue the final rule for purposes of the regulations required in paragraph (1), and such rule shall be effective, not later than the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on July 10, 1992.
