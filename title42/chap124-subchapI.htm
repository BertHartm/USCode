<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) local law enforcement authorities often lack the resources to deal with the drug problem in public and other federally assisted low-income housing, particularly in light of the recent reductions in Federal aid to cities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Federal Government should provide support for effective safety and security meas<!-- PDFPage:6509 -->ures to combat drug-related and violent crime, primarily in and around public housing projects with severe crime problems;</p>
