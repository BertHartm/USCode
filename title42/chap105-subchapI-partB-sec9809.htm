<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this part to meet the special economic needs of rural communities or areas with concentrations or substantial numbers of low-income persons by providing support to self-help programs which promote economic development and independence, as a supplement to existing similar programs conducted by other departments and agencies of the Federal Government. Such programs should encourage low-income families to pool their talents and resources so as to create and expand rural economic enterprise.</p>
