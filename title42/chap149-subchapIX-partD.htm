<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) accelerate deployment and commercialization of biofuels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) deliver the first 1,000,000,000 gallons in annual cellulosic biofuels production by 2015;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) ensure biofuels produced after 2015 are cost competitive with gasoline and diesel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) ensure that small feedstock producers and rural small businesses are full participants in the development of the cellulosic biofuels industry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
