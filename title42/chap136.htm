<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligibility for grant</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;13726. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Increasingly, States are turning to private prisoner transport companies as an alternative to their own personnel or the United States Marshals Service when transporting violent prisoners.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The transport process can last for days if not weeks, as violent prisoners are dropped off and picked up at a network of hubs across the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Escapes by violent prisoners during transport by private prisoner transport companies have occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Oversight by the Attorney General is required to address these problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) While most governmental entities may prefer to use, and will continue to use, fully trained and sworn law enforcement officers when transporting violent prisoners, fiscal or logistical concerns may make the use of highly specialized private prisoner transport companies an option. Nothing in sections 13726 to 13726c of this title should be construed to mean that governmental entities should contract with private prisoner transport companies to move violent prisoners; however when a government entity opts to use a private prisoner transport company to move violent prisoners, then the company should be subject to regulation in order to enhance public safety.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">National Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;367, Oct. 27, 2000, 114 Stat. 1412, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;National Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The goals of the Police Athletic League are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) increase the academic success of youth participants in PAL programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) promote a safe, healthy environment for youth under the supervision of law enforcement personnel where mutual trust and respect can be built;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) increase school attendance by providing alternatives to suspensions and expulsions;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) reduce the juvenile crime rate in participating designated communities and the number of police calls involving juveniles during nonschool hours;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) provide youths with alternatives to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang activity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) create positive communications and interaction between youth and law enforcement personnel; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) prepare youth for the workplace.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Police Athletic League, during its 55-year history as a national organization, has proven to be a positive force in the communities it serves.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Police Athletic League is a network of 1,700 facilities serving over 3,000 communities. There are 320 PAL chapters throughout the United States, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, serving 1,500,000 youths, ages 5 to 18, nationwide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Based on PAL chapter demographics, approximately 82 percent of the youths who benefit from PAL programs live in inner cities and urban areas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) PAL chapters are locally operated, volunteer-driven organizations. Although most PAL chapters are sponsored by a law enforcement agency, PAL chapters receive no direct funding from law enforcement agencies and are dependent in large part on support from the private sector, such as individuals, business leaders, corporations, and foundations. PAL chapters have been exceptionally successful in balancing public funds with private sector donations and maximizing community involvement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Today's youth face far greater risks than did their parents and grandparents. Law enforcement statistics demonstrate that youth between the ages of 12 and 17 are at risk of committing violent acts and being victims of violent acts between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Greater numbers of students are dropping out of school and failing in school, even though the consequences of academic failure are more dire in 1999 than ever before.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Many distressed areas in the United States are still underserved by PAL chapters.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purpose of this Act is to provide adequate resources in the form of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) assistance for the 320 established PAL chapters to increase of services to the communities they are serving; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) seed money for the establishment of 250 (50 per year over a 5-year period) additional local PAL chapters in public housing projects and other distressed areas, including distressed areas with a majority population of Native Americans, by not later than fiscal year 2006.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Study and development of model legislation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) study and evaluate the manner in which the States have taken measures to protect the confidentiality of communications between sexual assault or domestic violence victims and their therapists or trained counselors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop model legislation that will provide the maximum protection possible for the confidentiality of such communications, within any applicable constitutional limits, taking into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the danger that counseling programs for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence will be unable to achieve their goal of helping victims recover from the trauma associated with these crimes if there is no assurance that the records of the counseling sessions will be kept confidential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consideration of the appropriateness of an absolute privilege for communications between victims of sexual assault or domestic violence and their therapists or trained counselors, in light of the likelihood that such an absolute privilege will provide the maximum guarantee of confidentiality but also in light of the possibility that such an absolute privilege may be held to violate the rights of criminal defendants under the Federal or State constitutions by denying them the opportunity to obtain exculpatory evidence and present it at trial; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consideration of what limitations on the disclosure of confidential communications between victims of these crimes and their counselors, short of an absolute privilege, are most likely to ensure that the counseling programs will not be undermined, and specifically whether no such disclosure should be allowed unless, at a minimum, there has been a particularized showing by a criminal defendant of a compelling need for records of such communications, and adequate procedural safeguards are in place to prevent unnecessary or damaging disclosures; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) prepare and disseminate to State authorities the findings made and model legislation developed as a result of the study and evaluation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report and recommendations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than the date that is 1 year after September 13, 1994, the Attorney General shall report to the Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the findings of the study and the model legislation required by this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) recommendations based on the findings on the need for and appropriateness of further action by the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review of Federal evidentiary rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Judicial Conference of the United States shall evaluate and report to Congress its views on whether the Federal Rules of Evidence should be amended, and if so, how they should be amended, to guarantee that the confidentiality of communications between sexual assault victims and their therapists or trained counselors will be adequately protected in Federal court proceedings.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to the affirmative power of Congress to enact this part under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I of the Constitution, it is the purpose of this part to protect the civil rights of victims of gender motivated violence and to promote public safety, health, and activities affecting interstate commerce by establishing a Federal civil rights cause of action for victims of crimes of violence motivated by gender.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Right to be free from crimes of violence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender (as defined in subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cause of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;crime of violence motivated by gender&rdquo; means a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's gender; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;crime of violence&rdquo; means&mdash;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13981_1_target" name="13981_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony against the person or that would constitute a felony against property if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, and that would come within the meaning of State or Federal offenses described in section 16 of title 18, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not those acts were committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prison jurisdiction of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but for the relationship between the person who takes such action and the individual against whom such action is taken.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation and procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section entitles a person to a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be motivated by gender (within the meaning of subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No prior criminal action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Concurrent jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal and State courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Supplemental jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither section 1367 of title 28 nor subsection (c) of this section shall be construed, by reason of a claim arising under such subsection, to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody decree.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The training sessions at training centers established under this section shall be designed to provide basic law enforcement training, including vigorous physical and mental training to teach participants self-discipline and organizational loyalty and to impart knowledge and understanding of legal processes and law enforcement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Evaluation of participants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A participant shall be evaluated during training for mental, physical, and emotional fitness, and shall be required to meet performance standards prescribed by the Director at the conclusion of each training session in order to remain in the Police Corps program.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Until such time as the advisory board has made recommendations to the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Director has acted upon those recommendations, the quality assurance guidelines adopted by the technical working group on DNA analysis methods shall be deemed the Director's standards for purposes of this section.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) new forensic DNA testing procedures have made it possible to get results from minute samples that could not previously be tested, and to obtain more informative and accurate results than earlier forms of forensic DNA testing could produce, resulting in some cases of convicted inmates being exonerated by new DNA tests after earlier tests had failed to produce definitive results;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the owner of a motor vehicle may voluntarily sign a consent form with a participating State or locality in which the motor vehicle owner&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) agrees to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include an express statement that the vehicle is not normally operated under the specified conditions and that the operation of the vehicle under those conditions would provide sufficient grounds for a prudent law enforcement officer to reasonably believe that the vehicle was not being operated by or with the consent of the owner; and</p>

If more than one set of conditions is established, a separate consent form and a separate design for program decals or devices shall be established for each set of conditions. The Attorney General may choose to satisfy the requirement of a separate design for program decals or devices under this paragraph by the use of a design color that is clearly distinguishable from other design colors.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No new conditions without consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the program has begun, the conditions under which a vehicle may be stopped if affixed with a certain decal or device design may not be expanded without the consent of the owner.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limited participation by States and localities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State or locality need not authorize the stopping of motor vehicles under all sets of conditions specified under the program in order to participate in the program.</p>
