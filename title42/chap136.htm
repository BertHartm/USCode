<h3 class="section-head">&sect;13726. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Increasingly, States are turning to private prisoner transport companies as an alternative to their own personnel or the United States Marshals Service when transporting violent prisoners.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The transport process can last for days if not weeks, as violent prisoners are dropped off and picked up at a network of hubs across the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Escapes by violent prisoners during transport by private prisoner transport companies have occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Oversight by the Attorney General is required to address these problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) While most governmental entities may prefer to use, and will continue to use, fully trained and sworn law enforcement officers when transporting violent prisoners, fiscal or logistical concerns may make the use of highly specialized private prisoner transport companies an option. Nothing in sections 13726 to 13726c of this title should be construed to mean that governmental entities should contract with private prisoner transport companies to move violent prisoners; however when a government entity opts to use a private prisoner transport company to move violent prisoners, then the company should be subject to regulation in order to enhance public safety.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">National Police Athletic/Activities League Youth Enrichment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;367, Oct. 27, 2000, 114 Stat. 1412, as amended by Pub. L. 109&ndash;248, title VI, &sect;&sect;612&ndash;617, July 27, 2006, 120 Stat. 632, 633, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;National Police Athletic/Activities League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The goals of the Police Athletic/Activities League are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) increase the academic success of youth participants in PAL programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) promote a safe, healthy environment for youth under the supervision of law enforcement personnel where mutual trust and respect can be built;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) develop life enhancing character and leadership skills in young people;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) increase school attendance by providing alternatives to suspensions and expulsions;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) reduce the juvenile crime rate in participating designated communities and the number of police calls involving juveniles during nonschool hours;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) provide youths with alternatives to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang activity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) create positive communications and interaction between youth and law enforcement personnel; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(H) prepare youth for the workplace.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Police Athletic/Activities League, during its 90-year history as a national organization, has proven to be a positive force in the communities it serves.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Police Athletic/Activities League is a network of 1,700 facilities serving over 3,000 communities. There are 350 PAL chapters throughout the United States, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, serving 2,000,000 youth, ages 5 to 18, nationwide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Based on PAL chapter demographics, approximately 85 percent of the youths who benefit from PAL programs live in inner cities and urban areas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) PAL chapters are locally operated, volunteer-driven organizations. Although most PAL chapters are sponsored by a law enforcement agency, PAL chapters rarely receive direct funding from law enforcement agencies and are dependent in large part on support from the private sector, such as individuals, business leaders, corporations, and foundations. PAL chapters have been exceptionally successful in balancing public funds with private sector donations and maximizing community involvement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Today's youth face far greater risks than did their parents and grandparents. Law enforcement statistics demonstrate that youth between the ages of 12 and 18 are at risk of committing violent acts and <!-- PDFPage:7214 -->being victims of violent acts between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Greater numbers of students are dropping out of school and failing in school, even though the consequences of academic failure are more dire in 2005 than ever before.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Many distressed areas in the United States are still underserved by PAL chapters.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purpose of this Act is to provide adequate resources in the form of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) assistance for the 342 established PAL chapters to increase of services to the communities they are serving;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) seed money for the establishment of 250 (50 per year over a 5-year period) additional local PAL chapters in public housing projects and other distressed areas, including distressed areas with a majority population of Native Americans, by not later than fiscal year 2010; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) support of an annual gathering of PAL chapters and designated youth leaders from such chapters to participate in a 3-day conference that addresses national and local issues impacting the youth of America and includes educational sessions to advance character and leadership skills.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.</h4>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title II, &sect;201, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 2993, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Nearly 1/3 of American women report physical or sexual abuse by a husband or boyfriend at some point in their lives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) According to the National Crime Victimization Survey, 248,000 Americans 12 years of age and older were raped or sexually assaulted in 2002.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Rape and sexual assault in the United States is estimated to cost $127,000,000,000 per year, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) lost productivity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) medical and mental health care;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) police and fire services;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) social services;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) loss of and damage to property; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) reduced quality of life.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Nonreporting of sexual assault in rural areas is a particular problem because of the high rate of nonstranger sexual assault.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Geographic isolation often compounds the problems facing sexual assault victims. The lack of anonymity and accessible support services can limit opportunities for justice for victims.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Domestic elder abuse is primarily family abuse. The National Elder Abuse Incidence Study found that the perpetrator was a family member in 90 percent of cases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Barriers for older victims leaving abusive relationships include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the inability to support themselves;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) poor health that increases their dependence on the abuser;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) fear of being placed in a nursing home; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) ineffective responses by domestic abuse programs and law enforcement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Disabled women comprise another vulnerable population with unmet needs. Women with disabilities are more likely to be the victims of abuse and violence than women without disabilities because of their increased physical, economic, social, or psychological dependence on others.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Many women with disabilities also fail to report the abuse, since they are dependent on their abusers and fear being abandoned or institutionalized.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Of the 598 battered women's programs surveyed&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) only 35 percent of these programs offered disability awareness training for their staff; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) only 16 percent dedicated a staff member to provide services to women with disabilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Problems of domestic violence are exacerbated for immigrants when spouses control the immigration status of their family members, and abusers use threats of refusal to file immigration papers and threats to deport spouses and children as powerful tools to prevent battered immigrant women from seeking help, trapping battered immigrant women in violent homes because of fear of deportation.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:7237 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Battered immigrant women who attempt to flee abusive relationships may not have access to bilingual shelters or bilingual professionals, and face restrictions on public or financial assistance. They may also lack assistance of a certified interpreter in court, when reporting complaints to the police or a 9&ndash;1&ndash;1 operator, or even in acquiring information about their rights and the legal system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) More than 500 men and women call the National Domestic Violence Hotline every day to get immediate, informed, and confidential assistance to help deal with family violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) The National Domestic Violence Hotline service is available, toll-free, 24 hours a day and 7 days a week, with bilingual staff, access to translators in 150 languages, and a TTY line for the hearing-impaired.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) With access to over 5,000 shelters and service providers across the United States, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands, the National Domestic Violence Hotline provides crisis intervention and immediately connects callers with sources of help in their local community.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Approximately 60 percent of the callers indicate that calling the Hotline is their first attempt to address a domestic violence situation and that they have not called the police or any other support services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Between 2000 and 2003, there was a 27 percent increase in call volume at the National Domestic Violence Hotline.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Improving technology infrastructure at the National Domestic Violence Hotline and training advocates, volunteers, and other staff on upgraded technology will drastically increase the Hotline's ability to answer more calls quickly and effectively.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;162, title III, &sect;301, Jan. 5, 2006, 119 Stat. 3003, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Youth, under the age of 18, account for 67 percent of all sexual assault victimizations reported to law enforcement officials.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Department of Justice consistently finds that young women between the ages of 16 and 24 experience the highest rate of non-fatal intimate partner violence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In 1 year, over 4,000 incidents of rape or sexual assault occurred in public schools across the country.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Young people experience particular obstacles to seeking help. They often do not have access to money, transportation, or shelter services. They must overcome issues such as distrust of adults, lack of knowledge about available resources, or pressure from peers and parents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A needs assessment on teen relationship abuse for the State of California, funded by the California Department of Health Services, identified a desire for confidentiality and confusion about the law as 2 of the most significant barriers to young victims of domestic and dating violence seeking help.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Only one State specifically allows for minors to petition the court for protection orders.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Many youth are involved in dating relationships, and these relationships can include the same kind of domestic violence and dating violence seen in the adult population. In fact, more than 40 percent of all incidents of domestic violence involve people who are not married.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) 40 percent of girls ages 14 to 17 report knowing someone their age who has been hit or beaten by a boyfriend, and 13 percent of college women report being stalked.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Of college women who said they had been the victims of rape or attempted rape, 12.8 percent of completed rapes, 35 percent of attempted rapes, and 22.9 percent of threatened rapes took place on a date. Almost 60 percent of the completed rapes that occurred on campus took place in the victim's residence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) According to a 3-year study of student-athletes at 10 Division I universities, male athletes made up only 3.3 percent of the general male university population, but they accounted for 19 percent of the students reported for sexual assault and 35 percent of domestic violence perpetrators.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) develop model legislation that will provide the maximum protection possible for the confidentiality of such communications, within any applicable constitutional limits, taking into account the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the danger that counseling programs for victims of sexual assault and domestic violence will be unable to achieve their goal of helping victims recover from the trauma associated with these crimes if there is no assurance that the records of the counseling sessions will be kept confidential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consideration of the appropriateness of an absolute privilege for communications between victims of sexual assault or domestic violence and their therapists or trained counselors, in light of the likelihood that such an absolute privilege will provide the maximum guarantee of confidentiality but also in light of the possibility that such an absolute privilege may be held to violate the rights of criminal defendants under the Federal or State constitutions by denying them the opportunity to obtain exculpatory evidence and present it at trial; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consideration of what limitations on the disclosure of confidential communications between victims of these crimes and their counselors, short of an absolute privilege, are most likely to ensure that the counseling programs will not be undermined, and specifically whether no such disclosure should be allowed unless, at a minimum, there has been a particularized showing by a criminal defendant of a compelling need for records of such communications, and adequate procedural safeguards are in place to prevent unnecessary or damaging disclosures; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to the affirmative power of Congress to enact this part under section 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, as well as under section 8 of Article I of the Constitution, it is the purpose of this part to protect the civil rights of victims of gender motivated violence and to promote public safety, health, and activities affecting interstate commerce by establishing a Federal civil rights cause of action for victims of crimes of violence motivated by gender.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Right to be free from crimes of violence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All persons within the United States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence motivated by gender (as defined in subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cause of action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person (including a person who acts under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, cus<!-- PDFPage:7245 -->tom, or usage of any State) who commits a crime of violence motivated by gender and thus deprives another of the right declared in subsection (b) of this section shall be liable to the party injured, in an action for the recovery of compensatory and punitive damages, injunctive and declaratory relief, and such other relief as a court may deem appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;crime of violence motivated by gender&rdquo; means a crime of violence committed because of gender or on the basis of gender, and due, at least in part, to an animus based on the victim's gender; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;crime of violence&rdquo; means&mdash;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13981_1_target" name="13981_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony against the person or that would constitute a felony against property if the conduct presents a serious risk of physical injury to another, and that would come within the meaning of State or Federal offenses described in section 16 of title 18, whether or not those acts have actually resulted in criminal charges, prosecution, or conviction and whether or not those acts were committed in the special maritime, territorial, or prison jurisdiction of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) includes an act or series of acts that would constitute a felony described in subparagraph (A) but for the relationship between the person who takes such action and the individual against whom such action is taken.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation and procedures</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section entitles a person to a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section for random acts of violence unrelated to gender or for acts that cannot be demonstrated, by a preponderance of the evidence, to be motivated by gender (within the meaning of subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) No prior criminal action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section requires a prior criminal complaint, prosecution, or conviction to establish the elements of a cause of action under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Concurrent jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Federal and State courts shall have concurrent jurisdiction over actions brought pursuant to this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Supplemental jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither section 1367 of title 28 nor subsection (c) of this section shall be construed, by reason of a claim arising under such subsection, to confer on the courts of the United States jurisdiction over any State law claim seeking the establishment of a divorce, alimony, equitable distribution of marital property, or child custody decree.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the former United States Advisory Board on Child Abuse suggests that domestic violence may be the single major precursor to child abuse and neglect fatalities in this country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) studies suggest that as many as 10,000,000 children witness domestic violence every year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) studies suggest that among children and teenagers, recent exposure to violence in the home was a significant factor in predicting a child's violent behavior;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a study by the Nurse-Family Partnership found that children whose parents did not participate in home visitation programs that provided coaching in parenting skills, advice and support, were almost 5 times more likely to be abused in their first 2 years of life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a child's exposure to domestic violence seems to pose the greatest independent risk for being the victim of any act of partner violence as an adult;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) children exposed to domestic violence are more likely to believe that using violence is an effective means of getting one's needs met and managing conflict in close relationships;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) children exposed to abusive parenting, harsh or erratic discipline, or domestic violence are at increased risk for juvenile crime; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in a national survey of more than 6,000 American families, 50 percent of men who frequently assaulted their wives also frequently abused their children.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;14043e. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There is a strong link between domestic violence and homelessness. Among cities surveyed, 44 percent identified domestic violence as a primary cause of homelessness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Ninety-two percent of homeless women have experienced severe physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lives. Of all homeless women and children, 60 percent had been abused by age 12, and 63 percent have been victims of intimate partner violence as adults.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Women and families across the country are being discriminated against, denied access to, and even evicted from public and subsidized housing because of their status as victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A recent survey of legal service providers around the country found that these providers have responded to almost 150 documented eviction cases in the last year alone where the tenant was evicted because of the domestic violence crimes committed against her. In addition, nearly 100 clients were denied housing because of their status as victims of domestic violence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Women who leave their abusers frequently lack adequate emergency shelter options. The lack of adequate emergency options for victims presents a serious threat to their safety and the safety of their children. Requests for emergency shelter by homeless women with children increased by 78 percent of United States cities surveyed in 2004. In the same year, 32 percent of the requests for shelter by homeless families went unmet due to the lack of available emergency shelter beds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The average stay at an emergency shelter is 60 days, while the average length of time it takes a homeless family to secure housing is 6 to 10 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Victims of domestic violence often return to abusive partners because they cannot find long-term housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) There are not enough Federal housing rent vouchers available to accommodate the number of people in need of long-term housing. Some people remain on the waiting list for Federal housing rent vouchers for years, while some lists are closed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Transitional housing resources and services provide an essential continuum between emergency shelter provision and independent <!-- PDFPage:7265 -->living. A majority of women in transitional housing programs stated that had these programs not existed, they would have likely gone back to abusive partners.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Because abusers frequently manipulate finances in an effort to control their partners, victims often lack steady income, credit history, landlord references, and a current address, all of which are necessary to obtain long-term permanent housing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Victims of domestic violence in rural areas face additional barriers, challenges, and unique circumstances, such as geographical isolation, poverty, lack of public transportation systems, shortages of health care providers, under-insurance or lack of health insurance, difficulty ensuring confidentiality in small communities, and decreased access to many resources (such as advanced education, job opportunities, and adequate childcare).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Congress and the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development have recognized in recent years that families experiencing domestic violence have unique needs that should be addressed by those administering the Federal housing programs.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The advisory board shall include as members scientists from State, local, and private forensic laboratories, molecular geneticists and population geneticists not affiliated with a fo<!-- PDFPage:7292 -->rensic laboratory, and a representative from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The advisory board shall develop, and if appropriate, periodically revise, recommended standards for quality assurance, including standards for testing the proficiency of forensic laboratories, and forensic analysts, in conducting analyses of DNA.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, after taking into consideration such recommended standards, shall issue (and revise from time to time) standards for quality assurance, including standards for testing the proficiency of forensic laboratories, and forensic analysts, in conducting analyses of DNA.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The standards described in paragraphs (1) and (2) shall specify criteria for quality assurance and proficiency tests to be applied to the various types of DNA analyses used by forensic laboratories.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) over the past decade, deoxyribonucleic acid testing (referred to in this section as &lsquo;DNA testing&rsquo;) has emerged as the most reliable forensic technique for identifying criminals when biological material is left at a crime scene;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) DNA testing was not widely available in cases tried prior to 1994;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) new forensic DNA testing procedures have made it possible to get results from minute samples that could not previously be tested, and to obtain more informative and accurate results than earlier forms of forensic DNA testing could produce, resulting in some cases of convicted inmates being exonerated by new DNA tests after earlier tests had failed to produce definitive results;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) DNA testing can and has resulted in the post-conviction exoneration of more than 75 innocent men and women, including some under sentence of death;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) in more than a dozen cases, post-conviction DNA testing that has exonerated an innocent person has also enhanced public safety by providing evidence that led to the apprehension of the actual perpetrator;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) experience has shown that it is not unduly burdensome to make DNA testing available to inmates in appropriate cases;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) under current Federal and State law, it is difficult to obtain post-conviction DNA testing because of time limits on introducing newly discovered evidence;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) only a few States have adopted post-conviction DNA testing procedures;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) States have received millions of dollars in DNA-related grants, and more funding is needed to improve State forensic facilities and to reduce the nationwide backlog of DNA samples from convicted offenders and crime scenes that need to be tested or retested using upgraded methods;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) No new conditions without consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the program has begun, the conditions under which a vehicle may be stopped if affixed with a certain decal or device design may not be expanded without the consent of the owner.</p>
