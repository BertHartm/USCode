Any such settlement under the authority of this section shall be final and conclusive for all purposes, notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary. If the Commission considers that a claim in excess of $5,000 is meritorious and would otherwise be covered by this section, the Commission may report the facts and circumstances thereof to the Congress for its consideration.</p>
