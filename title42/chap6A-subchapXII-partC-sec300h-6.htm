<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to establish procedures for development, implementation, and assessment of demonstration programs designed to protect critical aquifer protection areas located within areas designated as sole or principal source aquifers under section 300h&ndash;3(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Critical aquifer protection area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;critical aquifer protection area&rdquo; means either of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) All or part of an area located within an area for which an application or designation as a sole or principal source aquifer pursuant to section 300h&ndash;3(e) of this title, has been submitted and approved by the Administrator and which satisfies the criteria established by the Administrator under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) All or part of an area which is within an aquifer designated as a sole source aquifer as <!-- PDFPage:846 -->of June 19, 1986, and for which an areawide ground water quality protection plan has been approved under section 208 of the Clean Water Act [33 U.S.C. 1288] prior to June 19, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State, municipal or local government or political subdivision thereof or any planning entity (including any interstate regional planning entity) that identifies a critical aquifer protection area over which it has authority or jurisdiction may apply to the Administrator for the selection of such area for a demonstration program under this section. Any applicant shall consult with other government or planning entities with authority or jurisdiction in such area prior to application. Applicants, other than the Governor, shall submit the application for a demonstration program jointly with the Governor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall, by rule, establish criteria for identifying critical aquifer protection areas under this section. In establishing such criteria, the Administrator shall consider each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The vulnerability of the aquifer to contamination due to hydrogeologic characteristics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The number of persons or the proportion of population using the ground water as a drinking water source.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The economic, social and environmental benefits that would result to the area from maintenance of ground water of high quality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The economic, social and environmental costs that would result from degradation of the quality of the ground water.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Comprehensive plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The objective of a comprehensive management plan submitted by an applicant under this section shall be to maintain the quality of the ground water in the critical protection area in a manner reasonably expected to protect human health, the environment and ground water resources. In order to achieve such objective, the plan may be designed to maintain, to the maximum extent possible, the natural vegetative and hydrogeological conditions. Each of the following elements shall be included in such a protection plan:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A map showing the detailed boundary of the critical protection area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An identification of existing and potential point and nonpoint sources of ground water degradation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Identification of authority adequate to implement the plan, estimates of program costs, and sources of State matching funds.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such plan may also include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A determination of the quality of the existing ground water recharged through the special protection area and the natural recharge capabilities of the special protection area watershed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Requirements designed to maintain existing underground drinking water quality or improve underground drinking water quality if prevailing conditions fail to meet drinking water standards, pursuant to this chapter and State law.</p>
