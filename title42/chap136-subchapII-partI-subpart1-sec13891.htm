<!-- PDFPage:6290 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) unless the Attorney General determines that a longer timeline is appropriate in a particular case, the State will implement the project not later than 180 days after receiving a grant under subsection (a) of this section and will expend all of the grant during a 1-year period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the State has the capacity to continue implementing a community correctional facility beyond the funding period to ensure the continuity of the work;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) give written notice to a prisoner, not later than 30 days after the State first receives a grant under subsection (a) of this section or 30 days after the prisoner is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of not more than 7 years (whichever is later), of the proposed or current operation of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) accept at any time at which the project is in operation an application by a prisoner to participate in the project if, at the time of application, the remainder of the prisoner's sentence exceeds 180 days;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) review applications by prisoners in the sequence in which the State receives such applications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) not more than 50 days after reviewing such applications approve or disapprove the application; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) for the purposes of selecting eligible offenders to participate in such project, the State has authorized State courts to sentence an eligible offender directly to a community correctional facility, provided that the court gives assurances that the offender would have otherwise served a term of imprisonment.</p>
