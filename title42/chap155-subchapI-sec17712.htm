<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that experimental NASA sensors and missions that have the potential to benefit society if transitioned into operational monitoring systems be transitioned into operational status whenever possible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Interagency process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director of OSTP, in consultation with the Administrator, the Administrator of NOAA, and other relevant stakeholders, shall develop a process to transition, when appropriate, NASA Earth science and space weather missions or sensors into operational status. The process shall include coordination of annual agency budget requests as required to execute the transitions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Responsible agency official</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator and the Administrator of NOAA shall each designate an agency official who shall have the responsibility for and authority to lead NASA's and NOAA's transition activities and interagency coordination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each mission or sensor that is determined to be appropriate for transition under subsection (b), NASA and NOAA shall transmit to Congress a joint plan for conducting the transition. The plan shall include the strategy, milestones, and budget required to execute the transition. The transition plan shall be transmitted to Congress not later than 60 days after the successful completion of the mission or sensor critical design review.</p>
