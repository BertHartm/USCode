Notes or other obligations guaranteed pursuant to this section shall be in such form and denominations, have such maturities, and be subject to such conditions as may be prescribed by regulations issued by the Secretary. The Secretary may not deny a guarantee under this section on the basis of the proposed repayment period for the note or other obligation, unless the period is more than 20 years or the Secretary determines that the period causes the guarantee to constitute an unacceptable financial risk. Notwithstanding any other provision of law and subject only to the absence of qualified applicants or proposed activities and to the authority provided in this section, to the extent approved or provided in appropriation Acts, the Secretary shall enter into commitments to guarantee notes and obligations under this section with an aggregate principal amount of $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1993 and $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 1994. Of the amount approved in any appropriation Act for guarantees under this section in any fiscal year, the Secretary shall allocate 70 percent for guarantees for metropolitan cities, urban counties, and Indian tribes and 30 percent for guarantees for units of general local government in nonentitlement areas. The Secretary may waive the percentage requirements of the preceding sentence in any fiscal year only to the extent that there is an absence of qualified applicants or proposed activities from metropolitan cities, urban counties, and Indian tribes or units of general local government in nonentitlement areas.</p>
