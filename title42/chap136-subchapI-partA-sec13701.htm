<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to receive a grant under this part, a State or States organized as multi-State compacts shall submit an application to the Attorney General which includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assurances that the State or States have implemented, or will implement, correctional policies and programs, including truth in sentencing laws that ensure that violent offenders serve a substantial portion of the sentences imposed, that are designed to provide sufficiently severe punishment for violent offenders, including violent juvenile offenders, and that the prison time served is appropriately related to the determination that the inmate is a violent offender and for a period of time deemed necessary to protect the public;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) assurances that the State or States have involved counties and other units of local government, when appropriate, in the construction, development, expansion, modification, operation or improvement of correctional facilities designed to ensure the incarceration of violent offenders, and that the State or States will share funds received under this section with counties and other units of local government, taking into account the burden placed on these units of government when they are required to confine sentenced prisoners because of overcrowding in State prison facilities;</p>
