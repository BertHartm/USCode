<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if there is no individual qualifying under subparagraph (A), to the individual designated by such officer as beneficiary under such officer's most recently executed life insurance policy on file at the time of death with such officer's public safety agency, organization, or unit, provided that such individual survived such officer; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Where there is no final benefit paid, the recipient of any interim payment under subsection (c) of this section shall be liable for repayment of such amount.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the disability of a public safety officer if a benefit is payable under this subchapter with respect to the death of such public safety officer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Death by heart attack or stroke; presumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, if a public safety officer dies as the direct and proximate result of a heart attack or stroke, that officer shall be presumed to have died as the direct and proximate result of a personal injury sustained in the line of duty, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that officer, while on duty&mdash;</p>
