<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) The computerized list shall serve as the official voter registration list for the conduct of all elections for Federal office in the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Computerized list maintenance</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The appropriate State or local election official shall perform list maintenance with respect to the computerized list on a regular basis as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) If an individual is to be removed from the computerized list, such individual shall be removed in accordance with the provisions of the National Voter Registration Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.), including subsections (a)(4), (c)(2), (d), and (e) of section 8 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1973gg&ndash;6).</p>
