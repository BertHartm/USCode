<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to establish a pilot program of grants to States to help establish or expand public, statewide specialty secondary schools that provide comprehensive science and mathematics (including technology and engineering) education to improve the academic achievement of students in science and mathematics.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of specialty school for science and mathematics</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this subpart, the term &ldquo;specialty school for science and mathematics&rdquo; means a public secondary school (including a school that provides residential services to students) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) serves students residing in the State in which the school is located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) offers to those students a high-quality, comprehensive science and mathematics (including technology and engineering) curriculum designed to improve the academic achievement of students in science and mathematics.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Pilot program authorized</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">From the amounts authorized under subsection (i), the Secretary, acting through the Director and in consultation with the Director of the National Science Foundation, shall award grants, on a competitive basis, to States in order to provide assistance to the States for the costs of establishing or expand<!-- PDFPage:5770 -->ing public, statewide specialty schools for science and mathematics.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Resources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall ensure that appropriate resources of the Department, including the National Laboratories, are available to schools funded under this section in order to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide ongoing professional development opportunities for teachers employed at such schools.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consistent with sections 7381b and 7381c of this title, the Director shall make available from&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7381h_1_target" name="7381h_1">1</a></sup> funds authorized in this section to carry out a program using scientific and engineering staff of the National Laboratories, during which the staff&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assists teachers in teaching courses at the schools funded under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) uses National Laboratory scientific equipment in teaching the courses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) uses distance education and other technologies to provide assistance described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) to schools funded under this section that are not located near the National Laboratories.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Restrictions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Maximum number of funded specialty schools per State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No State shall receive funding for more than 1 specialty school for science and mathematics for a fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Maximum amount and duration of grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A grant awarded to a State for a specialty school for science and mathematics under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not exceed $2,000,000 for a fiscal year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall not be provided for more than 3 fiscal years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Federal and non-Federal shares</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Federal share</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible to receive a grant under this section, a State shall submit to the Director an application at such time, in such manner, and containing such information as the Director may require that describes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the process by which and selection criteria with which the State will select and designate a school as a specialty school for science and mathematics in accordance with this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) how the State will ensure that funds made available under this section are used to establish or expand a specialty school for science and mathematics&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in accordance with the activities described in subsection (g); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that has the capacity to improve the academic achievement of all students in all core academic subjects, and particularly in science and mathematics;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
