<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (hereafter referred to as the &ldquo;Administrator&rdquo;) shall establish a program to assist small communities in planning and financing environmental facilities. The program shall be known as the &ldquo;Small Town Environmental Planning Program&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Small Town Environmental Planning Task Force</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall establish a Small Town Environmental Planning Task Force which shall be composed of representatives of small towns from different areas of the United States, Federal and State governmental agencies, and public interest groups.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) review proposed regulations for the protection of the environmental and public health and suggest revisions that could improve the ability of small towns to comply with such regulations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) identify means to promote regionalization of environmental treatment systems and infrastructure serving small towns to improve the economic condition of such systems and infrastructure; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Identification of environmental requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 6 months after October 6, 1992, the Administrator shall publish a list of requirements under Federal environmental and public health statutes (and the regulations developed pursuant to such statutes) applicable to small towns. Not less than annually, the Administrator shall make such additions and deletions to and from the list as the Administrator deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall, as part of the Small Town Environmental Planning Program under this section, implement a program to notify small communities of the regulations identified under paragraph (1) and of future regulations and requirements through methods that the Administrator determines to be effective to provide information to the greatest number of small communities, including any of the following:</p>
