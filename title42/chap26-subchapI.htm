<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Exclusive property of United States; issuance of patent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any invention is made in the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration, and the Administrator determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the person who made the invention was employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work and the invention is related to the work he was employed or assigned to perform, or that it was within the scope of his employment duties, whether or not it was made during working hours, or with a contribution by the Government of the use of Government facilities, equipment, materials, allocated funds, information proprietary to the Government, or services of Government employees during working hours; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person who made the invention was not employed or assigned to perform research, development, or exploration work, but the invention is nevertheless related to the contract, or to the work or duties he was employed or assigned to perform, and was made during working hours, or with a contribution from the Government of the sort referred to in clause (1),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">such invention shall be the exclusive property of the United States, and if such invention is patentable a patent therefor shall be issued to the United States upon application made by the Administrator, unless the Administrator waives all or any part of the rights of the United States to such invention in conformity with the provisions of subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contract provisions for furnishing reports of inventions, discoveries, improvements, or innovations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each contract entered into by the Administrator with any party for the performance of any work shall contain effective provisions under which such party shall furnish promptly to the Administrator a written report containing full and complete technical information concerning any invention, discovery, improvement, <!-- PDFPage:3300 -->or innovation which may be made in the performance of any such work.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Patent application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No patent may be issued to any applicant other than the Administrator for any invention which appears to the Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks to have significant utility in the conduct of aeronautical and space activities unless the applicant files with the Commissioner, with the application or within thirty days after request therefor by the Commissioner, a written statement executed under oath setting forth the full facts concerning the circumstances under which such invention was made and stating the relationship (if any) of such invention to the performance of any work under any contract of the Administration. Copies of each such statement and the application to which it relates shall be transmitted forthwith by the Commissioner to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Issuance of patent to applicant; request by Administrator; notice; hearing; determination; review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon any application as to which any such statement has been transmitted to the Administrator, the Commissioner may, if the invention is patentable, issue a patent to the applicant unless the Administrator, within ninety days after receipt of such application and statement, requests that such patent be issued to him on behalf of the United States. If, within such time, the Administrator files such a request with the Commissioner, the Commissioner shall transmit notice thereof to the applicant, and shall issue such patent to the Administrator unless the applicant within thirty days after receipt of such notice requests a hearing before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the question whether the Administrator is entitled under this section to receive such patent. The Board may hear and determine, in accordance with rules and procedures established for interference cases, the question so presented, and its determination shall be subject to appeal by the applicant or by the Administrator to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in accordance with procedures governing appeals from decisions of the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences in other proceedings.</p>

Notice of any such request shall be transmitted by the Commissioner to the owner of record of such patent, and title to such patent shall be so transferred to the Administrator unless within thirty days after receipt of such notice such owner of record requests a hearing before the Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences on the question whether any such false representation was contained in such statement. Such question shall be heard and determined, and determination thereof shall be subject to review, in the manner prescribed by subsection (d) of this section for questions arising thereunder. No request made by the Administrator under this subsection for the transfer of title to any patent, and no prosecution for the violation of any criminal statute, shall be barred by any failure of the Administrator to make a request under subsection (d) of this section for the issuance of such patent to him, or by any notice previously given by the Administrator stating that he had no objection to the issuance of such patent to the applicant therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Waiver of rights to inventions; Inventions and Contributions Board</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under such regulations in conformity with this subsection as the Administrator shall prescribe, he may waive all or any part of the rights of the United States under this section with respect to any invention or class of inventions made or which may be made by any person or class of persons in the performance of any work required by any contract of the Administration if the Administrator determines that the interests of the United States will be served thereby. Any such waiver may be made upon such terms and under such conditions as the Administrator shall determine to be required for the protection of the interests of the United States. Each such waiver made with respect to any invention shall be subject to the reservation by the Administrator of an irrevocable, nonexclusive, nontransferable, royalty-free license for the practice of such invention throughout the world by or on behalf of the United States or any foreign government pursuant to any treaty or agreement with the United States. Each proposal for any waiver under this subsection shall be referred to an Inventions and Contributions Board which shall be established by the Administrator within the Administration. Such Board shall accord to each interested party an opportunity for hearing, and shall transmit to the Administrator its findings of fact with respect to such proposal and its recommendations for action to be taken with respect thereto.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Use policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) It shall be the policy of the United States to use the Space Shuttle for purposes that (i) require the presence of man, (ii) require the unique capabilities of the Space Shuttle or (iii) when other compelling circumstances exist.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The term &ldquo;compelling circumstances&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to, occasions when the Administrator determines, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, that important national security or foreign policy interests would be served by a Shuttle launch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The policy stated in subsection (a)(1) of this section shall not preclude the use of available cargo space, on a Space Shuttle mission otherwise consistent with the policy described under subsection (a)(1) of this section, for the purpose of carrying secondary payloads (as defined by the Administrator) that do not require the presence of man if such payloads are consistent with the requirements of research, development, demonstration, scientific, commercial, and educational programs authorized by the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Implementation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall, within six months after November 16, 1990, submit a report to the Congress setting forth a plan for the implementation of the policy described in subsection (a)(1) of this section. Such plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) details of the implementation plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a list of purposes that meet such policy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a proposed schedule for the implementation of such policy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an estimate of the costs to the United States of implementing such policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a process for informing the Congress in a timely and regular manner of how the plan is being implemented.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Annual report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At least annually, the Administrator shall submit to the Congress a report certifying that the payloads scheduled to be launched on the space shuttle for the next four years are consistent with the policy set forth in subsection (a)(1) of this section. For each payload scheduled to be launched from the space shuttle, which do not require the presence of man, the Administrator shall, in the certified report to Congress, state the specific circumstances which justified the use of the space shuttle. If, during the period between scheduled reports to the Congress, any additions are made to the list of certified payloads intended to be launched from the Shuttle, the Administrator shall inform the Congress of the additions and the reasons therefor within 45 days of the change.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) NASA payloads</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The report described in subsection (c) of this section shall also include those National Aeronautics and Space Administration payloads designed solely to fly on the space shuttle which have begun the phase C/D of its development cycle.</p>
