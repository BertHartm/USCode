<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall support programs of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application to expand the use of geothermal energy production from hydrothermal systems, including the programs described in subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Advanced hydrothermal resource tools</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, in consultation with other appropriate agencies, shall support a program to develop advanced geophysical, geochemical, and geologic tools to assist in locating hidden hydrothermal resources, and to increase the reliability of site characterization before, during, and after initial drilling. The program shall develop new prospecting techniques to assist in prioritization of targets for characterization. The program shall include a field component.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Industry coupled exploratory drilling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall support a program of cost-shared field demonstration programs, to be pursued, simultaneously and independently, in collaboration with industry partners, for the demonstration of advanced technologies and techniques of siting and exploratory drilling for undiscovered resources in a variety of geologic settings. The program shall include incentives to encourage the use of advanced technologies and techniques.</p>
