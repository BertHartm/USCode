<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any solid waste management facility or disposal site, or (2) engaged in any activity resulting, or which may result, in the disposal or management of solid waste or hazardous waste shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements, both substantive and procedural (including any requirement for permits or reporting or any provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as may be imposed by a court to enforce such relief), respecting control and abatement of solid waste or hazardous waste disposal and management in the same manner, and to the same extent, as any person is subject to such requirements, including the payment of reasonable service charges. The Federal, State, interstate, and local substantive and procedural requirements referred to in this subsection include, but are not limited to, all administrative orders and all civil and administrative penalties and fines, regardless of whether such penalties or fines are punitive or coercive in nature or are imposed for isolated, intermittent, or continuing violations. The United States hereby expressly waives any immunity otherwise applicable to the United States with respect to any such substantive or procedural requirement (including, but not limited to, any injunctive relief, administrative order or civil or administrative penalty or fine referred to in the preceding sentence, or reasonable service charge). The reasonable service charges referred to in this subsection include, but are not limited to, fees or charges assessed in connection with the processing and issuance of permits, renewal of permits, amendments to permits, review of plans, studies, and other documents, and inspection and monitoring of facilities, as well as any other nondiscriminatory charges that are assessed in connection with a Federal, State, interstate, or local solid waste or hazardous waste regulatory program. Neither the United States, nor any agent, employee, or officer thereof, shall be im<!-- PDFPage:4672 -->mune or exempt from any process or sanction of any State or Federal Court with respect to the enforcement of any such injunctive relief. No agent, employee, or officer of the United States shall be personally liable for any civil penalty under any Federal, State, interstate, or local solid or hazardous waste law with respect to any act or omission within the scope of the official duties of the agent, employee, or officer. An agent, employee, or officer of the United States shall be subject to any criminal sanction (including, but not limited to, any fine or imprisonment) under any Federal or State solid or hazardous waste law, but no department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government shall be subject to any such sanction. The President may exempt any solid waste management facility of any department, agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch from compliance with such a requirement if he determines it to be in the paramount interest of the United States to do so. No such exemption shall be granted due to lack of appropriation unless the President shall have specifically requested such appropriation as a part of the budgetary process and the Congress shall have failed to make available such requested appropriation. Any exemption shall be for a period not in excess of one year, but additional exemptions may be granted for periods not to exceed one year upon the President's making a new determination. The President shall report each January to the Congress all exemptions from the requirements of this section granted during the preceding calendar year, together with his reason for granting each such exemption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative enforcement actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator may commence an administrative enforcement action against any department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government pursuant to the enforcement authorities contained in this chapter. The Administrator shall initiate an administrative enforcement action against such a department, agency, or instrumentality in the same manner and under the same circumstances as an action would be initiated against another person. Any voluntary resolution or settlement of such an action shall be set forth in a consent order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No administrative order issued to such a department, agency, or instrumentality shall become final until such department, agency, or instrumentality has had the opportunity to confer with the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on State use of funds collected from Federal Government</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless a State law in effect on October 6, 1992, or a State constitution requires the funds to be used in a different manner, all funds collected by a State from the Federal Government from penalties and fines imposed for violation of any substantive or procedural requirement referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be used by the State only for projects designed to improve or protect the environment or to defray the costs of environmental protection or enforcement.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 402. Affirmative Procurement Programs. (a) The head of each executive agency shall develop and implement affirmative procurement programs in accordance with section 6002 of RCRA (42 U.S.C. 6962) and this order and consider use of the procurement tools and methods described in 7 U.S.C. 5909. Agencies shall ensure that responsibilities for preparation, implementation, and monitoring of affirmative procurement programs are shared between the program personnel and acquisition and procurement personnel. For the purposes of all purchases made pursuant to this order, EPA, in consultation with such other executive agencies as appropriate, shall endeavor to maximize environmental benefits, consistent with price, performance, and availability considerations, and constraints imposed by law, and shall adjust solicitation guidelines as necessary in order to accomplish this goal.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agencies shall establish affirmative procurement programs for all EPA-designated guideline items purchased by their agency. For newly designated items, agencies shall revise their internal programs within 1 year from the date the EPA designated the new items.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Exclusive of the biobased products described in section 504, for the EPA-designated guideline items, which are contained in 40 CFR part 247, and for all future designated guideline items, agencies shall ensure that their affirmative procurement programs require 100 percent of their purchases of products to meet or exceed the EPA guideline unless written justification is provided that a product is not available competitively within a reasonable time frame, does not meet appropriate performance standards, or is only available at an unreasonable price. Written justification is not required for purchases below the micropurchase threshold. For micropurchases, agencies shall provide guidance regarding purchase of EPA-designated guideline items. This guidance should encourage consideration of aggregating purchases when this method would promote economy and efficiency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Within 90 days after the date of this order, the head of each executive agency that has not implemented an affirmative procurement program shall ensure that the affirmative procurement program has been established and is being implemented to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 403. Federal Facility Compliance.

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 5&mdash;STANDARDS, SPECIFICATIONS, AND DESIGNATION OF ITEMS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 501. Specifications, Product Descriptions, and Standards. When developing, reviewing, or revising Federal and military specifications, product descriptions (including commercial item descriptions), and standards, executive agencies shall consider recovered materials and any environmentally preferable purchasing criteria developed by the EPA, and ensure the criteria are complied with in developing or revising standards. Agencies shall report annually to the FEE on their compliance with this section for incorporation into the biennial report to the President referred to in section 302(a)(2) of this order. (a) If an inconsistency with section 6002 of RCRA [42 U.S.C. 6962] or this order is identified in a specification, standard, or product description, the FEE shall request that the Environmental Executive of the pertinent agency advise the FEE as to why the specification cannot be revised or submit a plan for revising it within 60 days.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If an agency is able to revise an inconsistent specification but cannot do so within 60 days, it is the responsibility of that AEE to monitor and implement the plan for revising it.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 502. Designation of Items that Contain Recovered Materials. In order to expedite the process of designating items that are or can be made with recovered materials, the EPA shall use the following process for designating these items in accordance with section 6002(e) of RCRA. (a) The EPA shall designate items that are or can be made with recovered material, by promulgating amendments to the Comprehensive Procurement Guideline (CPG). The CPG shall be updated every 2 years or as appropriate after an opportunity for public comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Concurrent with the issuance of the CPG, the EPA shall publish for comment in the Federal Register Recovered Materials Advisory Notices that present the range of recovered materials content levels within which the designated items are currently available. These levels shall be updated periodically, after opportunity for public comment, to reflect changes in market conditions.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Once items containing recovered materials have been designated by the EPA in the CPG, agencies shall modify their affirmative procurement programs to require that, to the maximum extent practicable, their purchases of products meet or exceed the EPA guidelines unless written justification is provided that a product is not available competitively, not available within a reasonable time frame, does not meet appropriate performance standards, or is only available at an unreasonable price.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 503. Guidance on Acquisition of Environmentally Preferable Products and Services. (a) The EPA shall develop guidance within 90 days from the date of this order to address environmentally preferable purchasing. The guidance may be based on the EPA's September 1995 Proposed Guidance on the Acquisition of Environmentally Preferable Products and Services and comments received thereon. The guidance should be designed for Government-wide use and targeted towards products and services that have the most effect. The guidance may also address the issues of use of the technical expertise of nongovernmental entities and tools such as life cycle assessment in decisions on environmentally preferable purchasing. The EPA shall update this guidance every 2 years, or as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agencies are encouraged to immediately test and evaluate the principles and concepts contained in the EPA's Guidance on the Acquisition of Environmentally Preferable Products and Services through pilot projects to provide practical information to the EPA for further updating of the guidance. Specifically:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) These pilot projects shall be focused around those product and service categories, including printing, that <!-- PDFPage:4676 -->have wide use within the Federal Government. Priorities regarding which product and service categories to pilot shall be developed by the individual agencies and the EPA, in consultation with the OFPP, the FEE, and the appropriate agency procurement executives. Any policy disagreements shall be resolved by the Steering Committee.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Agencies are encouraged to use all of the options available to them to determine the environmentally preferable attributes of products and services in their pilot and demonstration projects, including the use of technical expertise of nongovernmental entities such as labeling, certification, or standards-developing organizations, as well as using the expertise of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Upon request and to the extent practicable, the EPA shall assist executive agencies in designing, implementing, and documenting the results of these pilot and demonstration projects.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) The EPA, in coordination with other executive agencies, shall develop a database of information about these projects, including, but not limited to, the number and status of pilot projects, examples of agencies&rsquo; policy directives, revisions to specifications, solicitation procedures, and grant/contract policies that facilitate adoption of environmentally preferable purchasing practices, to be integrated on a commonly available electronic medium (e.g., Internet Web site). These data are to be reported to the FEE.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Executive agencies shall use the principles and concepts in the EPA Guidance on Acquisition of Environmentally Preferable Products and Services, in addition to the lessons from the pilot and demonstration projects, to the maximum extent practicable, in identifying and purchasing environmentally preferable products and services and shall modify their procurement programs as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 504. Designation of Biobased Items by the USDA. The USDA Biobased Products Coordination Council shall, in consultation with the FEE, issue a Biobased Products List. (a) The Biobased Products List shall be published in the Federal Register by the USDA within 180 days after the date of this order and shall be updated biannually after publication to include additional items.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Once the Biobased Products List has been published, agencies are encouraged to modify their affirmative procurement program to give consideration to those products.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 505. Minimum Content Standard for Printing and Writing Paper. Executive agency heads shall ensure that their agencies meet or exceed the following minimum materials content standards when purchasing or causing the purchase of printing and writing paper: (a) For high speed copier paper, offset paper, forms bond, computer printout paper, carbonless paper, file folders, white wove envelopes, writing and office paper, book paper, cotton fiber paper, and cover stock, the minimum content standard shall be no less than 30 percent postconsumer materials beginning December 31, 1998. If paper containing 30 percent postconsumer material is not reasonably available, does not meet reasonable performance requirements, or is only available at an unreasonable price, then the agency shall purchase paper containing no less than 20 percent postconsumer material. The Steering Committee, in consultation with the AEEs, may revise these levels if necessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) As an alternative to meeting the standards in sections [sic] 505(a), for all printing and writing papers, the minimum content standard shall be no less than 50 percent recovered materials that are a waste material byproduct of a finished product other than a paper or textile product that would otherwise be disposed of in a landfill, as determined by the State in which the facility is located.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Effective January 1, 1999, no executive branch agency shall purchase, sell, or arrange for the purchase of, printing and writing paper that fails to meet the minimum requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 506. Revision of Brightness Specifications and Standards. The GSA and other executive agencies are directed to identify, evaluate, and revise or eliminate any standards or specifications unrelated to performance that present barriers to the purchase of paper or paper products made by production processes that minimize emissions of harmful byproducts. This evaluation shall include a review of unnecessary brightness and stock clause provisions, such as lignin content and chemical pulp requirements. The GSA shall complete the review and revision of such specifications within 6 months after the date of this order, and shall consult closely with the Joint Committee on Printing during such process. The GSA shall also compile any information or market studies that may be necessary to accomplish the objectives of this provision.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 507. Procurement of Re-refined Lubricating Oil and Retread Tires.
