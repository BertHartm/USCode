<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for financial participation by the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide for the establishment or designation of a single and separate organizational unit, which meets such staffing and organizational requirements as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, within the State to administer the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) provide that such State will undertake&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of a child born out of wedlock with respect to whom an assignment under section 602(a)(26) of this title or section 1396k of this title is effective, to establish the paternity of such child, unless the agency administering the plan of the State under part A of this subchapter determines in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to section 602(a)(26)(B) of this title that it is against the best interests of the child to do so, or, in the case of such a child with respect to whom an assignment under section 1396k of this title is in effect, the State agency administering the plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter determines pursuant to section 1396k(a)(1)(B) of this title that it is against the best interests of the child to do so, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of any child with respect to whom such assignment is effective, including an assignment with respect to a child on whose behalf a State agency is making foster care maintenance payments under part E of this subchapter, to secure support for such child from his parent (or from any other person legally liable for such support), and from such parent for his spouse (or former spouse) receiving aid to families with dependent children or medical assistance under a State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter (but only if a support obligation has been established with respect to such spouse, and only if the support obligation established with respect to the child is being enforced under the plan), utilizing any reciprocal arrangements adopted with other States (unless the agency administering the plan of the State under part A or E of this subchapter determines in accordance with the standards prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to section 602(a)(26)(B) of this title that it is against the best interests of the child to do so), except that when such arrangements and other means have proven ineffective, the State may utilize the Federal courts to obtain or enforce court orders for support;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) provide that (A) in any case in which support payments are collected for an individual with respect to whom an assignment under section 602(a)(26) of this title is effective, such payments shall be made to the State for distribution pursuant to section 657 of this title and shall not be paid directly to the family, and the individual will be notified on a monthly basis (or on a quarterly basis for so long as the Secretary determines with respect to a State that requiring such notice on a monthly basis would impose an unreasonable administrative burden) of the amount of the support payments collected;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#654_1_target" name="654_1">1</a></sup> except that this paragraph shall not apply to such payments for any month following the first month in which the amount collected is sufficient to make such family ineligible for assistance under the State plan approved under part A of this subchapter; and (B) in any case in which support payments are collected for an individual pursuant to the assignment made under section 1396k of this title, such payments shall be made to the State for distribution pursuant to section 1396k of this title, except that this clause shall not apply to such payments for any month after the month in which the individual ceases to be eligible for medical assistance;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) from the parent who owes the child or spousal support obligation involved, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at the option of the State, from the individual to whom such services are made available, but only if such State has in effect a procedure whereby all persons in such State having authority to order child or spousal support are informed that such costs are to be collected from the individual to whom such services were made available;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Parent Locator Service in the Department of Health and Human Services;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide that the State will, in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, cooperate with any other State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in establishing paternity, if necessary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in locating an absent parent residing in the State (whether or not permanently) against whom any action is being taken under a program established under a plan approved under this part in another State,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in securing compliance by an absent parent residing in such State (whether or not permanently) with an order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction against such parent for the support and maintenance of the child or children or the parent of such child or children with respect to whom aid is being provided under the plan of such other State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in carrying out other functions required under a plan approved under this part;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) comply with such bonding requirements, for employees who receive, disburse, handle, or have access to, cash, as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) maintain methods of administration which are designed to assure that persons responsible for handling cash receipts shall not participate in accounting or operating functions which would permit them to conceal in the accounting records the misuse of cash receipts (except that the Secretary shall by regulations provide for exceptions to this requirement in the case of sparsely populated areas where the hiring of unreasonable additional staff would otherwise be necessary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) provide, at the option of the State, for the establishment, in accordance with an (initial and annually updated) advance automated data processing planning document approved under section 652(d) of this title, of a statewide automated data processing and information retrieval system designed effectively and efficiently to assist management in the administration of the State plan, in the State and localities thereof, so as (A) to control, account for, and monitor (i) all the factors in the support enforcement collection and paternity determination process under such plan (including, but not limited to, (I) identifiable correlation factors (such as social security numbers, names, dates of birth, home addresses and mailing addresses (including postal ZIP codes) of any individual with respect to whom support obligations are sought to be established or enforced and with respect to any person to whom such support obligations are owing) to assure sufficient compatibility among the systems of different jurisdictions to permit periodic screening to determine whether such individual is paying or is obligated to pay support in more than one jurisdiction, (II) checking of records of such individuals on a periodic basis with Federal, intra- and inter-State, and local agencies, (III) maintaining the data necessary to meet the Federal reporting requirements on a timely basis, and (IV) delinquency and enforcement activities), (ii) the collection and distribution of support payments (both intra- and inter-State), the determination, collection, and distribution of incentive payments both inter- and intra-State, and the maintenance of accounts receivable on all amounts owed, collected and distributed, and (iii) the costs of all services rendered, either directly or by interfacing with State financial management and expenditure information, (B) to provide interface with records of the State's aid to families with dependent children program in order to determine if a collection of a support payment causes a change affecting eligibility for or the amount of aid under such program, (C) to provide for security against unauthorized access to, or use of, the data in such system, (D) to facilitate the development and improvement of the income withholding and other procedures required under section 666(a) of this title through the monitoring of support payments, the maintenance of accurate records regarding the payment of support, and <!-- PDFPage:1250 -->the prompt provision of notice to appropriate officials with respect to any arrearages in support payments which may occur, and (E) to provide management information on all cases under the State plan from initial referral or application through collection and enforcement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) in the case of a State which has in effect an agreement with the Secretary entered into pursuant to section 663 of this title for the use of the Parent Locator Service established under section 653 of this title, provide that the State will accept and transmit to the Secretary requests for information authorized under the provisions of the agreement to be furnished by such Service to authorized persons, will impose and collect (in accordance with regulations of the Secretary) a fee sufficient to cover the costs to the State and to the Secretary incurred by reason of such requests, will transmit to the Secretary from time to time (in accordance with such regulations) so much of the fees collected as are attributable to such costs to the Secretary so incurred, and during the period that such agreement is in effect will otherwise comply with such agreement and regulations of the Secretary with respect thereto;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) provide that the State has in effect procedures necessary to obtain payment of past-due support from overpayments made to the Secretary of the Treasury as set forth in section 664 of this title, and take all steps necessary to implement and utilize such procedures;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall determine on a periodic basis, from information supplied pursuant to section 508 of the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1976, whether any individuals receiving compensation under the State's unemployment compensation law (including amounts payable pursuant to any agreement under any Federal unemployment compensation law) owe child support obligations which are being enforced by such agency, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall enforce any such child support obligations which are owed by such an individual but are not being met&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) through an agreement with such individual to have specified amounts withheld from compensation otherwise payable to such individual and by submitting a copy of any such agreement to the State agency administering the unemployment compensation law, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the absence of such an agreement, by bringing legal process (as defined in section 662(e) of this title) to require the withholding of amounts from such compensation;</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) assure that the fee will be collected in addition to, and only after full payment of, the overdue support, and that the imposition of the late payment fee shall not directly or indirectly result in a decrease in the amount of the support which is paid to the child (or spouse) to whom, or on whose behalf, it is owed;</p>
