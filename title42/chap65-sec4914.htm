<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall certify any product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for which a certification application has been filed in accordance with paragraph (5)(A) of this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) which is a low-noise-emission product as determined by the Administrator; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) which he determines is suitable for use as a substitute for a type of product at that time in use by agencies of the Federal Government.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator may establish a Low-Noise-Emission Product Advisory Committee to assist him in determining which products qualify as low-noise-emission products for purposes of this section. The Committee shall include the Administrator or his designee, a representative of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and representatives of such other Federal agencies and private individuals as the Administrator may deem necessary from time to time. Any member of the Committee not employed on a full-time basis by the United States may receive the daily equivalent of the annual rate of basic pay in effect for Grade GS&ndash;18 of the General Schedule for each day such member is engaged upon work of the Committee.

<p class="statutory-body">(G) Immediately upon making any determination or decision under subparagraph (F), the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register notice of such determination or decision, including reasons therefor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Federal procurement of low-noise-emission products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Certified low-noise-emission products shall be acquired by purchase or lease by the Federal Government for use by the Federal Government in lieu of other products if the Administrator of General Services determines that such certified products have procurement costs which are no more than 125 per centum of the retail price of the least expensive type of product for which they are certified substitutes.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The procuring agency shall be required to purchase available certified low-noise-emission products which are eligible for purchase to the extent they are available before purchasing any other products for which any low-noise-emission product is a certified substitute. In making purchasing selections between competing eligible certified low-noise-emission products, the procuring agency shall give priority to any class or model which does not require extensive periodic maintenance to retain its low-noise-emission qualities or which does not involve operating costs significantly in excess of those products for which it is a certified substitute.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of statutory price limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of procuring certified low-noise-emission products any statutory price limitations shall be waived.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Tests of noise emissions from products purchased by Federal Government</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall, from time to time as he deems appropriate, test the emissions of noise from certified low-noise-emission products purchased by the Federal Government. If at any time he finds that the noise-emission levels exceed the levels on which certification under this section was based, the Administrator shall give the supplier of such product written notice of this finding, issue public notice of it, and give the supplier an opportunity to make necessary repairs, adjustments, or replacements. If no such repairs, adjustments, or replacements are made within a period to be set by the Administrator, he may order the supplier to show cause why the product involved should be eligible for recertification.</p>
