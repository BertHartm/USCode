<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may make grants for the purpose of providing for the operating expenses of trauma centers that have incurred substantial uncompensated costs in providing trauma care in geographic areas with a significant incidence of violence arising directly or indirectly from illicit trafficking in drugs. Grants under this subsection may be made only to such trauma centers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum qualifications of centers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Significant incidence of treating certain patients</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section to a trauma center unless the population of patients that has been served by the center for the period specified in subparagraph (B) includes a significant number of patients who were treated for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) trauma resulting from the penetration of the skin by knives, bullets, or any other implement that can be used as a weapon; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) trauma that the center reasonably believes results from violence arising directly or indirectly from illicit trafficking in drugs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The period specified in this subparagraph is the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which the trauma center involved is applying to receive a grant under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Participation in trauma care system operating under certain professional guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the trauma center involved is a participant in a system that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides comprehensive medical care to victims of trauma in the geographic area in which the trauma center is located;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is established by the State or political subdivision in which such center is located; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) has adopted guidelines for the designation of trauma centers, and for triage, transfer, and transportation policies, equivalent to (or more protective than) the applicable guidelines developed by the American College of Surgeons or utilized in the model plan established under section 300d&ndash;13(c) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) agrees that such guidelines will be adopted by the system not later than 6 months after the date on which the trauma center submits to the Secretary the application for the grant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Submission and approval of long-term plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the trauma center involved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) submits to the Secretary a plan satisfactory to the Secretary that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is developed on the assumption that the center will continue to incur substantial uncompensated costs in providing trauma care; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provides for the long-term continued operation of the center with an acceptable standard of medical care, notwithstanding such uncompensated costs; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) agrees to implement the plan according to a schedule approved by the Secretary.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making grants under section 300d&ndash;41(a) of this title, the Secretary shall give preference to any application&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) made by a trauma center that, for the purpose specified in such section, will receive financial assistance from the State or political subdivision involved for each fiscal year during which payments are made to the center from the grant, which financial assistance is exclusive of any assistance provided by the State or political subdivision as a non-Federal contribution under any Federal program requiring such a contribution; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) made by a trauma center that, with respect to the system described in section 300d&ndash;41(b)(2) of this title in which the center is a participant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is providing trauma care in a geographic area in which the availability of trauma care has significantly decreased as a result of a trauma center in the area permanently ceasing participation in such system as of a date occurring during the 2-year period specified in section 300d&ndash;41(b)(1)(B) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) will, in providing trauma care during the 1-year period beginning on the date on which the application for the grant is submitted, incur uncompensated costs in an amount rendering the center unable to continue participation in such system, resulting in a significant decrease in the availability of trauma care in the geographic area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Further preference for certain applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to applications for grants under section 300d&ndash;41 of this title that are receiving preference for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall give further preference to any such application made by a trauma center for which a disproportionate percentage of the uncompensated costs of the center result from the provision of trauma care to individuals who neither are citizens nor aliens lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Trauma care registry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may not make a grant under section 300d&ndash;41(a) of this title unless the trauma center involved agrees that&mdash;</p>
