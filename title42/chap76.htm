<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Methods of achieving compliance with regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The head of any Federal department or agency who prescribes regulations under section 6103 of this title may seek to achieve compliance with any such regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by terminating, or refusing to grant or to continue, assistance under the program or activity involved to any recipient with respect to whom there has been an express finding on the record, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing, of a failure to comply with any such regulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by any other means authorized by law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on termination of, or on refusal to grant or to continue, assistance; disbursement of withheld funds to achiever agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any termination of, or refusal to grant or to continue, assistance under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be limited to the particular political entity or other recipient with respect to which a finding has been made under subsection (a)(1) of this section. Any such termination or refusal shall be limited in its effect to the particular program or activity, or part of such program or activity, with respect to which such finding has been made. No such termination or refusal shall be based in whole or in part on any finding with respect to any program or activity which does not receive Federal financial assistance. Whenever the head of any Federal department or agency who prescribes regulations under section 6103 of this title withholds funds pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, he may, in accordance with regulations he shall prescribe, disburse the funds so withheld di<!-- PDFPage:3915 -->rectly to any public or nonprofit private organization or agency, or State or political subdivision thereof, which demonstrates the ability to achieve the goals of the Federal statute authorizing the program or activity while complying with regulations issued under section 6103 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Advice as to failure to comply with regulation; determination that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No action may be taken under subsection (a) of this section until the head of the Federal department or agency involved has advised the appropriate person of the failure to comply with the regulation involved and has determined that compliance cannot be secured by voluntary means.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any action taken under subsection (a) of this section, the head of the Federal department or agency involved shall transmit a written report of the circumstances and grounds of such action to the committees of the House of Representatives and the Senate having legislative jurisdiction over the program or activity involved. No such action shall take effect until thirty days after the transmission of any such report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Injunctions; notice of violations; costs; conditions for actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) When any interested person brings an action in any United States district court for the district in which the defendant is found or transacts business to enjoin a violation of this Act by any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance, such interested person shall give notice by registered mail not less than 30 days prior to the commencement of that action to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Attorney General of the United States, and the person against whom the action is directed. Such interested person may elect, by a demand for such relief in his complaint, to recover reasonable attorney's fees, in which case the court shall award the costs of suit, including a reasonable attorney's fee, to the prevailing plaintiff.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The notice referred to in paragraph (1) shall state the nature of the alleged violation, the relief to be requested, the court in which the action will be brought, and whether or not attorney's fees are being demanded in the event that the plaintiff prevails. No action described in paragraph (1) shall be brought (A) if at the time the action is brought the same alleged violation by the same defendant is the subject of a pending action in any court of the United States; or (B) if administrative remedies have not been exhausted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exhaustion of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to actions brought for relief based on an alleged violation of the provisions of this chapter, administrative remedies shall be deemed exhausted upon the expiration of 180 days from the filing of an administrative complaint during which time the Federal department or agency makes no finding with regard to the complaint, or upon the day that the Federal department or agency issues a finding in favor of the recipient of financial assistance, whichever occurs first.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loan guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and rules prescribed under subsection (d) of this section, guarantee loans made to eligible persons described in subsection (c)(1) of this section for the purpose of developing new underground coal mines.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Secretary's determinations prerequisite to loan guarantee; maximum guarantees; aggregate outstanding guaranteed loans; new underground coal mines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person may receive for a loan guarantee under subsection (a) of this section only if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such person is capable of successfully developing and operating the mine with respect to which the loan guarantee is sought;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such person has provided adequate assurance that the mine will be constructed and operated in compliance with the provisions of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act [30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.] and that no final judgment holding such person liable for any fine or penalty under such Act is unsatisfied;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there is a reasonable prospect of repayment of the guaranteed loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such person has obtained a contract, of at least the duration of the period during which the loan is required to be repaid, for the sale or resale of coal to be produced from such mine to a person who the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency certifies will be able to burn such coal in compliance with all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.], and of any applicable implementation plan (as defined in section 110 of such Act) [42 U.S.C. 7410];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the loan will be adequately secured;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) such person would be unable to obtain adequate financing without such guarantee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) the guaranteeing of a loan to such person will enhance competition or encourage new market entry; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) such person has adequate coal reserves to cover contractual commitments described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The total amount of guarantees issued to any person (including all persons affiliated with such person) may not exceed $30,000,000. The amount of a guarantee issued with respect to any loan may not exceed 80 percent of the lesser of (A) the principal balance of the loan or, (B) the cost of developing such new underground coal mine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The aggregate outstanding principal amount of loans which are guaranteed under this section may not at any time exceed $750,000,000. Not more than 20 percent of the amount of guarantees issued under this section in any fiscal year may be issued with respect to loans for the purpose of opening new underground coal mines which produce coal which is not low sulfur coal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Construction and definition of terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A person shall be considered eligible for a guarantee under this section if such person (together with all persons affiliated with such person)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) did not produce more than 1,000,000 tons of coal in the calendar year preceding the year in which he makes application for a loan guarantee under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) did not produce more than 300,000 barrels of crude oil or own an oil refinery in such preceding calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) did not have gross revenues in excess of $50,000,000 in such calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A person is affiliated with another person if he controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such other person, as such term may be further defined by rule by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;low sulfur coal&rdquo; means coal which, in a quantity necessary to produce one million British thermal units, does not contain sulfur or sulfur compounds the elemental sulfur content of which exceeds 0.6 pound. Sulfur content shall be determined after the application of any coal preparation process which takes place before sale of the coal by the producer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;developing new underground coal mine&rdquo; includes expansion of any existing underground coal mine in a manner designed to increase the rate of production of such mine, and the reopening of any underground coal mine which had previously been closed. Such term also includes construction of a coal preparation plant which is designed to reduce the sulfur content of coal produced from any coal mine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this section. Such rules shall require that each application for a guarantee under this section shall be made in writing to the Secretary in such form and with such content and other submissions as the Secretary shall require, in order reasonably to protect the interests of the United States. Each guarantee shall be issued in accordance with subsections (a) through (c) of this section, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under such terms and conditions as the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, considers appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with such provisions with respect to the date of issue of such guarantee as the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury, considers appropriate, except that the required concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury may not, without the consent of the Secretary, result in a delay in the issuance of such guarantee for more than 60 days; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3933 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in such form as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Recordkeeping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each person who receives a loan guarantee under this section shall keep such records as the Secretary or the Secretary of the Treasury shall require, including records which fully disclose the total cost of the project for which a loan is guaranteed under this section and such other records as the Secretary or the Secretary of the Treasury determines necessary to facilitate an effective audit and performance evaluation. The Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of any person who receives a loan guarantee under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the transferring of oil from the Naval Petroleum Reserve; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) other activities specified in this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, not later than December 15, 1976, shall prepare and transmit to the Congress, in accordance with section 6421 of this title, a Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan. Such Plan shall comply with the provisions of this section and shall detail the Secretary's proposals for designing, constructing, and filling the storage and related facilities of the Reserve.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Levels of crude oil to be stored</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To the maximum extent practicable and except to the extent that any change in the storage schedule is justified pursuant to subsection (e)(6) of this section, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan shall provide that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within 7 years after December 22, 1975, the volume of crude oil stored in the Reserve shall equal the total volume of crude oil which was imported into the United States during the base period specified in paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) within 18 months after December 22, 1975, the volume of crude oil stored in the Reserve shall equal not less than 10 percent of the goal specified in subparagraph (A);</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) a justification for any changes, with respect to volumes or dates, proposed in the storage schedule specified in subsection (c) of this section, and a program schedule for overall development and completion of the Reserve (taking into account all relevant factors, including cost effectiveness, the need to construct related facilities, and the ability to obtain sufficient quantities of petroleum products to fill the storage facilities to the proposed storage levels);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) an estimate of the direct cost of the Reserve, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost of storage facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the cost of the petroleum products to be stored;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) management and operation costs;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) an evaluation of the impact of developing the Reserve, taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the availability and the price of supplies and equipment and the effect, if any, upon domestic production of acquiring such supplies and equipment for the Reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any fluctuations in world, and domestic, market prices for petroleum products which may result from the acquisition of substantial quantities of petroleum products for the Reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the extent to which such acquisition may support otherwise declining market prices for such products; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the extent to which such acquisition will affect competition in the petroleum industry;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) encouragement of competition in the petroleum industry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Fill operations by President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The President shall immediately undertake, and thereafter continue, petroleum products acquisition, transportation, and injection activities, to the extent funds are available pursuant to section 6247(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this title, at a level sufficient to assure that the petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average annual rate of at least the minimum required fill rate until the quantity of petroleum products stored within the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at least 500,000,000 barrels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to subparagraph (C), the minimum required fill rate shall be 300,000 barrels per day for purposes of subparagraph (A), unless there is in effect a finding by the President in his discretion for good cause that compliance with such rate would not be in the national interest. Any finding by the President under this subparagraph takes effect on the date such finding is transmitted to the Congress and ceases to have effect at the end of the fiscal year in which such finding was made. Any such finding transmitted to the Congress shall include a statement of the facts upon which the finding is based. Any such finding shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The minimum required fill rate shall be 220,000 barrels per day for purposes of subparagraph (A) during the period in which any finding by the President under subparagraph (B) is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) If funds are available in any given fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 to achieve an average annual fill rate higher than the minimum required fill rate in effect under subparagraph (C), the minimum required fill rate shall be the highest practicable fill rate achievable, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 [2 U.S.C. 681 et seq.] shall apply to funds made available under section 6247(b) and (e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After the Strategic Petroleum Reserve reaches a level of 500,000,000 barrels, the President shall immediately seek to undertake, and thereafter continue, petroleum products acquisition, transportation, and injection activities at a level sufficient to assure that the petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average annual rate of at least 300,000 barrels per day until the quantity of petroleum products stored within the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at least 750,000,000 barrels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), beginning in fiscal year 1987 and continuing through fiscal year 1994 until the quantity of crude oil in storage within the Reserve is 1,000,000,000 barrels, the President shall carry out petroleum acquisition, transportation, and injection activities at the highest practicable fill rate achievable, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Crude oil from Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1; reduction in fill-rate requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no portion of the United States share of crude oil in Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 (Elk Hills) may be sold or otherwise disposed of other than to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (either directly or by exchange) during any fiscal year, except as provided in paragraph (2), unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the quantity of crude oil in storage within Government owned facilities of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at least 750,000,000 barrels; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) acquisition, transportation, and injection activities for the Reserve are being undertaken for that fiscal year at a level sufficient to assure that crude oil in storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average rate of at least 75,000 barrels per day for that fiscal year and the Secretary has amended the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan as required by section 6239(j) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The requirements of paragraph (1) shall not apply to the United States share of crude oil in the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) sold to small refiners under section 7430(d) of title 10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) produced, consistent with sound engineering practices, for the purpose of preventing a reduction in the total quantity of crude oil available for ultimate recovery from the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1, and the amount produced is the minimum necessary to prevent such reduction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) produced for national defense purposes under section 7422(b)(2) of title 10, pursuant to an authorization of Congress under that section during the preceding 9-month period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining the number of barrels of crude oil for purposes of subparagraph (A) of <!-- PDFPage:3944 -->paragraph (1), any crude oil drawndown from the Reserve as a result of any drawdown and distribution carried out under section 6241(g) of this title and not replaced under section 6241(g)(6)(B) of this title shall be considered to be within the Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For any fiscal year in which purchases of petroleum products are suspended, or the sale of petroleum products is carried out, under subsection (f) of this section, the fill-rate requirements of paragraph (1)(B) shall be reduced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of petroleum products are&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6240_1_target" name="6240_1">1</a></sup> acquired for such fiscal year as a result of such suspension; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount of petroleum products sold under such subsection during such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Suspensions of fill operations, etc., during emergency situations; applicability, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply (A) if there is in effect an order of the President directing drawdown and distribution pursuant to section 6241 of this title or (B) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the President has found in his discretion that compliance with such provisions significantly impairs the ability of the United States to respond to a severe energy supply interruption or to meet the obligations of the United States under the international energy program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the President has transmitted such finding to the Congress.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The suspension of the application of subsections (c) and (d) of this section under paragraph (1)(B) may become effective on the day the finding is transmitted to the Congress and shall terminate nine months thereafter or on such earlier date as is specified in such finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The period of any suspension of subsections (c) and (d) of this section under this subsection, and the quantity of any petroleum product involved, shall be disregarded in applying the provisions of such subsections for periods following such suspension.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (c), (f), and (g) of this section, no drawdown and distribution of the Reserve may be made except in accordance with the provisions of the Distribution Plan contained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan which has taken effect pursuant to section 6239(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Drawdown and distribution of Early Storage Reserve in accordance with Distribution Plan contained in Early Storage Reserve Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Drawdown and distribution of the Early Storage Reserve may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Distribution Plan contained in the Early Storage Reserve Plan until the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan has taken effect pursuant to section 6239(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Presidential finding prerequisite to implementation of Distribution Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Neither the Distribution Plan contained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan nor the Distribution Plan contained in the Early Storage Reserve Plan may be implemented, and no drawdown and distribution of the Reserve or the Early Storage Reserve may be made, unless the President has found that implementation of either such Distribution Plan is required by a severe energy supply interruption or by obligations of the United States under the international energy program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this section, in addition to the circumstances set forth in section 6202(8) of this title, a severe energy supply interruption shall be deemed to exist if the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an emergency situation exists and there is a significant reduction in supply which is of significant scope and duration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a severe increase in the price of petroleum products has resulted from such emergency situation; and</p>

<!-- PDFPage:3948 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Directive to carry out test drawdown</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall conduct a continuing evaluation of the Distribution Plan. In the conduct of such evaluation, the Secretary is authorized to carry out test drawdown and distribution of crude oil from the Reserve. If any such test drawdown includes the sale or exchange of crude oil, then the aggregate quantity of crude oil withdrawn from the Reserve may not exceed 5,000,000 barrels during any such test drawdown or distribution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall carry out such drawdown and distribution in accordance with the Distribution Plan and implementing regulations and contract provisions, modified as the Secretary considers appropriate taking into consideration the artificialities of a test and the absence of a severe energy supply interruption. To meet the requirements of subsections (d) and (e) of section 6239 of this title, the Secretary shall transmit any such modification of the Plan, along with explanatory and supporting material, to both Houses of the Congress no later than 15 calendar days prior to the offering of any crude oil for sale under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may cancel any offer to sell or exchange crude oil as part of any drawdown and distribution under this subsection if the Secretary determines that there are insufficient acceptable offers to obtain such crude oil.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The minimum required fill rate in effect for any fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of any crude oil drawdown from the Reserve under this subsection during such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a sale of any crude oil under this subsection, the Secretary shall, to the extent funds are available in the SPR Petroleum Account as a result of such sale, acquire crude oil for the Reserve within the 12-month period beginning after the completion of the sale. Such acquisition shall be in addition to any acquisition of crude oil for the Reserve required as part of a fill rate established by any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Rules, regulations, or orders issued in order to carry out this subsection which have the applicability and effect of a rule as defined in section 551(4) of title 5 shall not be subject to the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 5 of such title or to section 6393 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Secretary shall transmit to both Houses of the Congress a detailed explanation of the drawdown and distribution carried out under this subsection. Such explanation may be a part of any report made to the President and the Congress under section 6245 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prevention or reduction of adverse impact of severe domestic energy supply interruptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the President finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a circumstance, other than those described in subsection (d) of this section, exists that constitutes, or is likely to become, a domestic or international energy supply shortage of significant scope or duration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) action taken under this subsection would assist directly and significantly in preventing or reducing the adverse impact of such shortage,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the Secretary may, subject to the limitations of paragraph (2), draw down and distribute the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In no case may the Reserve be drawn down under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in excess of an aggregate of 30,000,000 barrels with respect to each such shortage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for more than 60 days with respect to each such shortage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if there are fewer than 500,000,000 barrels of petroleum product stored in the Reserve; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) below the level of an aggregate of 500,000,000 barrels of petroleum product stored in the Reserve.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) During any period in which there is a drawdown and distribution of the Reserve in effect under this subsection, the Secretary shall transmit a monthly report to the Congress containing an account of the drawdown and distribution of petroleum products under this subsection and an assessment of its effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In no case may the drawdown under this subsection be extended beyond 60 days with respect to any domestic energy supply shortage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Exchange of withdrawn products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other law, the President may permit any petroleum products withdrawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in accordance with this section to be sold and delivered for refining or exchange outside of the United States, in connection with an arrangement for the delivery of refined petroleum products to the United States.</p>

Allocation under such rule shall be in such amounts and at such prices as are specified in (or determined in a manner prescribed by) such rule. Such rule may apply to any petroleum product owned or controlled by any person described in the first sentence of this subsection who is subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, including any petroleum product destined, directly or indirectly, for import into the United States or any foreign country, or produced in the United States.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) No meetings may be held to develop or carry out a voluntary agreement or plan of action under this section unless a regular full-time Federal employee is present.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Interested persons permitted to attend such a meeting shall be afforded an opportunity to present, in writing and orally, data, views, and arguments at such meetings, subject to any reasonable limitations with respect to the manner of presentation of data, <!-- PDFPage:3957 -->views, and arguments as the Secretary may impose.</p>

Such access to any transcript that is required to be kept for any meeting shall be provided as soon as practicable (but not later than 14 days) after that meeting.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All test procedures and related determinations prescribed or made by the Secretary with respect to any covered product (or class thereof) which are in effect on March 17, 1987, shall remain in effect until the Secretary amends such test procedures and related determinations under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amended and new procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary may amend test procedures with respect to any covered product if the Secretary determines that amended test procedures would more accurately or fully comply with the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may, in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, prescribe test procedures for any consumer product classified as a covered product under section 6292(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology to assist in developing new or amended test procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines, on his own behalf or in response to a petition by any interested person, that a test procedure should be prescribed or amended, the Secretary shall promptly publish in the Federal Register proposed test procedures and afford interested persons an opportunity to present oral and written data, views, and arguments with respect to such procedures. The comment period shall not be less than 60 days and may be extended for good cause shown to not more than 270 days. In prescribing or amending a test procedure, the Secretary shall take into account such information as the Secretary determines relevant to such procedure, including technological developments relating to energy use or energy efficiency of the type (or class) of covered products involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any test procedures prescribed or amended under this section shall be reasonably designed to produce test results which measure energy efficiency, energy use, water use (in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals), or estimated annual operating cost of a covered <!-- PDFPage:3974 -->product during a representative average use cycle or period of use, as determined by the Secretary, and shall not be unduly burdensome to conduct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the test procedure is a procedure for determining estimated annual operating costs, such procedure shall provide that such costs shall be calculated from measurements of energy use or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water use in a representative average use cycle or period of use, as determined by the Secretary, and from representative average unit costs of the energy needed to operate such product during such cycle, or in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, representative average unit costs of water and wastewater treatment service resulting from the operation of such products during such cycle. The Secretary shall provide information to manufacturers with respect to representative average unit costs of energy, water, and wastewater treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to fluorescent lamp ballasts manufactured on or after January 1, 1990, and to which standards are applicable under section 6295 of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe test procedures that are in accord with ANSI standard C82.2&ndash;1984 or other test procedures determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) With respect to fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps to which standards are applicable under subsection (i) of section 6295 of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe test procedures, to be carried out by accredited test laboratories, that take into consideration the applicable IES or ANSI standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Test procedures for showerheads and faucets to which standards are applicable under subsection (j) of section 6295 of this title shall be the test procedures specified in ASME A112.18.1M&ndash;1989 for such products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the test procedure requirements of ASME A112.18.1M&ndash;1989 are revised at any time and approved by ANSI, the Secretary shall amend the test procedures established by subparagraph (A) to conform to such revised ASME/ANSI requirements unless the Secretary determines, by rule, that to do so would not meet the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) Test procedures for water closets and urinals to which standards are applicable under subsection (k) of section 6295 of this title shall be the test procedures specified in ASME A112.19.6&ndash;1990 for such products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the test procedure requirements of ASME A112.19.6&ndash;1990 are revised at any time and approved by ANSI, the Secretary shall amend the test procedures established by subparagraph (A) to conform to such revised ASME/ANSI requirements unless the Secretary determines, by rule, that to do so would not meet the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restriction on certain representations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler may make any representation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in writing (including a representation on a label); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any broadcast advertisement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">with respect to the energy use or efficiency or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, and urinals, water use of a covered product to which a test procedure is applicable under subsection (a) of this section or the cost of energy consumed by such product, unless such product has been tested in accordance with such test procedure and such representation fairly discloses the results of such testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Effective 180 days after an amended or new test procedure applicable to a covered product is prescribed or established under subsection (b) of this section, no manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler may make any representation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in writing (including a representation on a label); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any broadcast advertisement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">with respect to energy use or efficiency or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, and urinals, water use of such product or cost of energy consumed by such product, unless such product has been tested in accordance with such amended or new test procedures and such representation fairly discloses the results of such testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the petition of any manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler, filed not later than the 60th day before the expiration of the period involved, the 180-day period referred to in paragraph (2) may be extended by the Secretary with respect to the petitioner (but in no event for more than an additional 180 days) if the Secretary determines that the requirements of paragraph (2) would impose an undue hardship on such petitioner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Case in which test procedure is not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is not required to publish and prescribe test procedures for a covered product (or class thereof) if the Secretary determines, by rule, that test procedures cannot be developed which meet the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section and publishes such determination in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of section 6297 of this title, a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to any covered product or class shall have the same effect as would a standard prescribed for a covered product (or class).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amendment of standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any amended test procedure which is prescribed pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall determine, in the rulemaking carried out with respect to prescribing such procedure, to what extent, if any, the proposed test procedure would alter the measured energy efficiency, measured energy use, or measured water use of any covered product as determined under the existing test procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines that the amended test procedure will alter the measured efficiency or measured use, the Secretary shall amend the applicable energy conservation standard during the rulemaking carried out with respect to such test procedure. In determining the amended energy conservation standard, the Secretary shall measure, pursuant to the amended test procedure, the energy efficiency, energy use, or water use of a representative sample of covered products that minimally <!-- PDFPage:3975 -->comply with the existing standard. The average of such energy efficiency, energy use, or water use levels determined under the amended test procedure shall constitute the amended energy conservation standard for the applicable covered products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Models of covered products in use before the date on which the amended energy conservation standard becomes effective (or revisions of such models that come into use after such date and have the same energy efficiency, energy use, or water use characteristics) that comply with the energy conservation standard applicable to such covered products on the day before such date shall be deemed to comply with the amended energy conservation standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary's authority to amend energy conservation standards under this subsection shall not affect the Secretary's obligation to issue final rules as described in section 6295 of this title.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any determination under this subsection shall be published in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Rules in effect; new rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Any labeling rule in effect on March 17, 1987, shall remain in effect until amended, by rule, by the Commission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After March 17, 1987, and not later than 30 days after the date on which a proposed test procedure applicable to a covered product of any of the types specified in paragraphs (1) through (13), and paragraphs (15) through (19) of section 6292(a) of this title (or class thereof) is prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title, the Commission shall publish a proposed labeling rule applicable to such type (or class thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall afford interested persons an opportunity to present written or oral data, views, and comments with respect to the proposed labeling rules published under paragraph (1). The period for such presentations shall not be less than 45 days.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3977 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) Not earlier than 45 days nor later than 60 days after the date on which test procedures are prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title with respect to covered products of any type (or class thereof) specified in paragraphs (1) through (12) of section 6292(a) of this title, the Commission shall prescribe labeling rules with respect to covered products of such type (or class thereof). Not earlier than 45 days after the date on which test procedures are prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title with respect to covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19) of section 6292(a) of this title, the Commission may prescribe labeling rules with respect to covered products of such type (or class thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A labeling rule prescribed under paragraph (3) shall take effect not later than 3 months after the date of prescription of such rule, except that such rules may take effect not later than 6 months after such date of prescription if the Commission determines that such extension is necessary to allow persons subject to such rules adequate time to come into compliance with such rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission may delay the publication of a proposed labeling rule, or the prescription of a labeling rule, beyond the dates specified in paragraph (1) or (3), if it determines that it cannot publish proposed labeling rules or prescribe labeling rules which meet the requirements of this section on or prior to the date specified in the applicable paragraph and publishes such determination in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor. In any such case, it shall publish proposed labeling rules or prescribe labeling rules for covered products of such type (or class thereof) as soon as practicable unless it determines (A) that labeling in accordance with this section is not economically or technically feasible, or (B) in the case of a type specified in paragraphs (3), (5), and (7) of section 6292(a) of this title, that labeling in accordance with this section is not likely to assist consumers in purchasing decisions. Any such determination shall be published in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor. This paragraph shall not apply to the prescription of a labeling rule with respect to covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19) of section 6292(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Content of label</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (6), a rule prescribed under this section shall require that each covered product in the type or class of covered products to which the rule applies bear a label which discloses&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the estimated annual operating cost of such product (determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title), except that if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Secretary determines that disclosure of estimated annual operating cost is not technologically feasible, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Commission determines that such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions or is not economically feasible,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Commission shall require disclosure of a different useful measure of energy consumption (determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) information respecting the range of estimated annual operating costs for covered products to which the rule applies; except that if the Commission requires disclosure under subparagraph (A) of a measure of energy consumption different from estimated annual operating cost, then the label shall disclose the range of such measure of energy consumption of covered products to which such rule applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rule under this section shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A description of the type or class of covered products to which such rule applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subject to paragraph (6), information respecting the range of estimated annual operating costs or other useful measure of energy consumption (determined in such manner as the rule may prescribe) for such type or class of covered products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) A description of the test procedures under section 6293 of this title used in determining the estimated annual operating costs or other measure of energy consumption of the type or class of covered products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A prototype label and directions for displaying such label.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rule under this section shall require that the label be displayed in a manner that the Commission determines is likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and is appropriate to carry out this part. The Commission may permit a tag to be used in lieu of a label in any case in which the Commission finds that a tag will carry out the purposes for which the label was intended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A rule under this section applicable to a covered product may require disclosure, in any printed matter displayed or distributed at the point of sale of such product, of any information which may be required under this section to be disclosed on the label of such product. Requirements under this paragraph shall not apply to any broadcast advertisement or any advertisement in any newspaper, magazine, or other periodical.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission may require that a manufacturer of a covered product to which a rule under this section applies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include on the label,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) separately attach to the product, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) ship with the product,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">additional information relating to energy consumption, including instructions for the maintenance, use, or repair of the covered product, if the Commission determines that such additional information would assist consumers in making purchasing decisions or in using such product, and that such requirement would not be unduly burdensome to manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Commission may delay the effective date of the requirement specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection applicable to a type or class of covered product, insofar as it requires the disclosure on the label of information respecting range of a measure of energy consumption, for not more than 12 months after the date on which the rule under this section is first applicable to such type or class, if the Commission <!-- PDFPage:3978 -->determines that such information will not be available within an adequate period of time before such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this subsection shall not apply to the covered product specified in paragraphs (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), and (18) of section 6292(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) If a manufacturer of a covered product specified in paragraph (15) or (17) of section 6292(a) of this title elects to provide a label for such covered product conveying the estimated annual operating cost of such product or the range of estimated annual operating costs for the type or class of such product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such estimated cost or range of costs shall be determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the format of such label shall be in accordance with a format prescribed by the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such label shall be displayed in a manner, prescribed by the Commission, to be likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A rule under this section (or an amendment thereto) shall not apply to any covered product the manufacture of which was completed prior to the effective date of such rule or amendment, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Study of certain products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, shall study consumer products for which labeling rules under this section have not been proposed, in order to determine (1) the aggregate energy consumption of such products, and (2) whether the imposition of labeling requirements under this section would be feasible and useful to consumers in making purchasing decisions. The Secretary shall include the results of such study in the annual report under section 6308 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Commission shall consult with each other on a continuing basis as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out their respective responsibilities under this part. Before the Commission makes any determination under subsection (a)(1) of this section, it shall obtain the views of the Secretary and shall take such views into account in making such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Other authority of the Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until such time as labeling rules under this section take effect with respect to a type or class of covered product, this section shall not affect any authority of the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] to require labeling with respect to energy consumption of such type or class of covered product.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Further rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After issuance of the last final rules required under subsections (b) through (i) of this section, the Secretary may publish final rules to determine whether standards for a covered product should be amended. An amendment prescribed under this subsection shall apply to products manufactured after a date which is 5 years after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effective date of the previous amendment made pursuant to this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the previous final rule published under this part did not amend the standard, the earliest date by which a previous amendment could have been in effect, except that in no case may an amended standard apply to products manufactured within 3 years (for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and kitchen ranges and ovens) or 5 years (for central air conditioners and heat pumps, water heaters, pool heaters, direct heating equipment and furnaces) after publication of the final rule establishing a standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall grant a petition if he finds that it contains evidence which, assuming no other evidence were considered, provides an adequate basis for amending the standards under the following criteria&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) amended standards will result in significant conservation of energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) amended standards are technologically feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) amended standards are cost effective as described in subsection (<em>o</em>)(2)(B)(i)(II) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The grant of a petition by the Secretary under this subsection creates no presumption with respect to the Secretary's determination of any of the criteria in a rulemaking under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An amendment prescribed under this subsection shall apply to products manufactured after a date which is 5 years after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effective date of the previous amendment pursuant to this part; or</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Criteria for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a covered product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed by the Secretary under this section for any type (or class) of covered product shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water efficiency, which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In determining whether a standard is economically justified, the Secretary shall, after receiving views and comments furnished with respect to the proposed standard, determine whether the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatest extent practicable, considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the total projected amount of energy, or as applicable, water, savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) the impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VI) the need for national energy and water conservation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VII) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(V), the Attorney General shall make a determination of the impact, if any, of any lessening of competition likely to result from such standard and shall transmit such determination, not later than 60 days after the publication of a proposed rule prescribing or amending an energy conservation standard, in writing to the Secretary, together with an analysis of the nature and extent of such impact. Any such determination and analysis shall be published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy, and as applicable, water, savings <!-- PDFPage:3986 -->during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary's determination of whether a standard is economically justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section for a type (or class) of covered product if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for products other than dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, and kitchen ranges and ovens, a test procedure has not been prescribed pursuant to section 6293 of this title with respect to that type (or class) of product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines, by rule, that the establishment of such standard will not result in significant conservation of energy or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water, or that the establishment of such standard is not technologically feasible or economically justified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of section 6297 of this title, a determination under subparagraph (B) with respect to any type (or class) of covered products shall have the same effect as would a standard prescribed for such type (or class).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the standard is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States in any covered product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some types (or classes) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a standard for other types (or classes).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Procedure for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard shall be prescribed in accordance with the following procedure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which specifies the type (or class) of covered products to which the rule may apply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall invite interested persons to submit, within 60 days after the date of publication of such advance notice, written presentations of data, views, and arguments in response to such notice; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may identify proposed or amended standards that may be prescribed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A proposed rule which prescribes an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribes no amendment or no new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published in the Federal Register. In prescribing any such proposed rule with respect to a standard, the Secretary shall determine the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible for each type (or class) of covered products. If such standard is not designed to achieve such efficiency or use, the Secretary shall state in the proposed rule the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) After the publication of such proposed rulemaking, the Secretary shall, in accordance with section 6306 of this title, afford interested persons an opportunity, during a period of not less than 60 days, to present oral and written comments (including an opportunity to question those who make such presentations, as provided in such section) on matters relating to such proposed rule, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the standard to be prescribed is economically justified (taking into account those factors which the Secretary must consider under subsection (<em>o</em>)(2) of this section) or will result in the effects described in subsection (<em>o</em>)(4) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the standard will achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which is technologically feasible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the standard will not achieve such improvement, whether the reasons for not achieving such improvement are adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether such rule should prescribe a level of energy use or efficiency which is higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply in the case of any group of products within the type (or class) that will be subject to such standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A final rule prescribing an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribing no amended or new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published as soon as is practicable, but not less than 90 days, after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Special rule for certain types or classes of products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A rule prescribing an energy conservation standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall specify a level of energy use or efficiency higher or lower than that which applies (or would apply) for such type (or class) for any group of covered products which have the same function or intended use, if the Secretary determines that covered products within such group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered products within such type (or class); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have a capacity or other performance-related feature which other products within such type (or class) do not have and such feature justifies a higher or lower standard from that which applies (or will apply) to other products within such type (or class).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under this paragraph concerning whether a performance-related feature justifies the establishment of a higher or lower standard, the Secretary shall consider such factors as the utility to the consumer of such a feature, and such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3987 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Any rule prescribing a higher or lower level of energy use or efficiency under paragraph (1) shall include an explanation of the basis on which such higher or lower level was established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Inclusion in standards of test procedures and other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed under this section shall include, where applicable, test procedures prescribed in accordance with section 6293 of this title and may include any requirement which the Secretary determines is necessary to assure that each covered product to which such standard applies meets the required minimum level of energy efficiency or maximum quantity of energy use specified in such standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Determination of compliance with standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Compliance with, and performance under, the energy conservation standards (except for design standards authorized by this part) established in, or prescribed under, this section shall be determined using the test procedures and corresponding compliance criteria prescribed under section 6293 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Small manufacturer exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may, on application of any manufacturer, exempt such manufacturer from all or part of the requirements of any energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under this section for any period not longer than the 24-month period beginning on the date such rule becomes effective, if the Secretary finds that the annual gross revenues of such manufacturer from all its operations (including the manufacture and sale of covered products) does not exceed $8,000,000 for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application. In making such finding with respect to any manufacturer, the Secretary shall take into account the annual gross revenues of any other person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such manufacturer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not exercise the authority granted under paragraph (1) with respect to any type (or class) of covered product subject to an energy conservation standard under this section unless the Secretary makes a finding, after obtaining the written views of the Attorney General, that a failure to allow an exemption under paragraph (1) would likely result in a lessening of competition.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of Federal preemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Any State or river basin commission with a State regulation which provides for any energy conservation standard or other requirement with respect to energy use, energy efficiency, or water use for any type (or class) of covered product for which there is a Federal energy conservation standard under section 6295 of this title may file a petition with the Secretary requesting a rule that such State regulation become effective with respect to such covered product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (5), the Secretary shall, within the period described in paragraph (2) and after consideration of the petition and the comments of interested persons, prescribe such rule if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that the State or river basin commission has established by a preponderance of the evidence that such State regulation is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy or water interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;unusual and compelling State or local energy or water interests&rdquo; means interests which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) are substantially different in nature or magnitude than those prevailing in the United States generally; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) are such that the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy or water savings resulting from the State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of alternative approaches to energy or water savings or production, including reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in efficiency of all products subject to the State regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The factors described in clause (ii) shall be evaluated within the context of the State's energy <!-- PDFPage:3991 -->plan and forecast, and, with respect to a State regulation for which a petition has been submitted to the Secretary which provides for any energy conservation standard or requirement with respect to water use of a covered product, within the context of the water supply and groundwater management plan, water quality program, and comprehensive plan (if any) of the State or river basin commission for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway affected by water supply development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall give notice of any petition filed under paragraph (1)(A) and afford interested persons a reasonable opportunity to make written comments, including rebuttal comments, thereon. The Secretary shall, within the 6-month period beginning on the date on which any such petition is filed, deny such petition or prescribe the requested rule, except that the Secretary may publish a notice in the Federal Register extending such period to a date certain but no longer than one year after the date on which the petition was filed. Such notice shall include the reasons for delay. In the case of any denial of a petition under this subsection, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of, and the reasons for, such denial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may not prescribe a rule under this subsection if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such State regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sale, or servicing of the covered product on a national basis. In determining whether to make such finding, the Secretary shall evaluate all relevant factors, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the extent to which the State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of manufacturers, distributors, and others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the extent to which the State regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered product in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered product type (or class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation would result in a reduction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the current models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the current or projected sales volume of the covered product type (or class) in the State and the United States; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the extent to which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State appliance efficiency requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not prescribe a rule under this subsection if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the State regulation is likely to result in the unavailability in the State of any covered product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding, except that the failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for other classes (or types).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No final rule prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) permit any State regulation to become effective with respect to any covered product manufactured within three years after such rule is published in the Federal Register or within five years if the Secretary finds that such additional time is necessary due to the substantial burdens of retooling, redesign, or distribution needed to comply with the State regulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) become effective with respect to a covered product manufactured before the earliest possible effective date specified in section 6295 of this title for the initial amendment of the energy conservation standard established in such section for the covered product; except that such rule may become effective before such date if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that, in addition to the other requirements of this subsection the State has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) there exists within the State an energy emergency condition or, if the State regulation provides for an energy conservation standard or other requirement with respect to the water use of a covered product for which there is a Federal energy conservation standard under subsection (j) or (k) of section 6295 of this title, a water emergency condition, which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) imperils the health, safety, and welfare of its residents because of the inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate quantities of gas or electric energy or, in the case of a water emergency condition, water or wastewater treatment, to its residents at less than prohibitive costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) cannot be substantially alleviated by the importation of energy or, in the case of a water emergency condition, by the importation of water, or by the use of interconnection agreements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the State regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any case in which a State is issued a rule under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered product and subsequently a Federal energy conservation standard concerning such product is amended pursuant to section 6295 of this title, any person subject to such State regulation may file a petition with the Secretary requesting the Secretary to withdraw the rule issued under paragraph (1) with respect to such product in such State. The Secretary shall consider such petition in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (3), and (4), except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to show by a pre<!-- PDFPage:3992 -->ponderance of the evidence that the rule received by the State under paragraph (1) should be withdrawn as a result of the amendment to the Federal standard. If the Secretary determines that the petitioner has shown that the rule issued by the State should be so withdrawn, the Secretary shall withdraw it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception for certain State procurement standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State regulation which sets forth procurement standards for a State (or political subdivision thereof) shall not be superseded by the provisions of this part if such standards are more stringent than the corresponding Federal energy conservation standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exception for certain building code requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A regulation or other requirement enacted or prescribed before January 8, 1987, that is contained in a State or local building code for new construction concerning the energy efficiency or energy use of a covered product is not superseded by this part until the effective date of the energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title for such covered product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A regulation or other requirement, or revision thereof, enacted or prescribed on or after January 8, 1987, that is contained in a State or local building code for new construction concerning the energy efficiency or energy use of a covered product is not superseded by this part until the effective date of the energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title for such covered product if the code does not require that the energy efficiency of such covered product exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the applicable minimum efficiency requirement in a national voluntary consensus standard; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the minimum energy efficiency level in a regulation or other requirement of the State meeting the requirements of subsection (b)(1) or (b)(5) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Effective on the effective date of an energy conservation standard for a covered product established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title, a regulation or other requirement contained in a State or local building code for new construction concerning the energy efficiency or energy use of such covered product is not superseded by this part if the code complies with all of the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The code permits a builder to meet an energy consumption or conservation objective for a building by selecting items whose combined energy efficiencies meet the objective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The code does not require that the covered product have an energy efficiency exceeding the applicable energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title, except that the required efficiency may exceed such standard up to the level required by a regulation of that State for which the Secretary has issued a rule granting a waiver under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The credit to the energy consumption or conservation objective allowed by the code for installing covered products having energy efficiencies exceeding such energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title or the efficiency level required in a State regulation referred to in subparagraph (B) is on a one-for-one equivalent energy use or equivalent cost basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If the code uses one or more baseline building designs against which all submitted building designs are to be evaluated and such baseline building designs contain a covered product subject to an energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title, the baseline building designs are based on the efficiency level for such covered product which meets but does not exceed such standard or the efficiency level required by a regulation of that State for which the Secretary has issued a rule granting a waiver under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) If the code sets forth one or more optional combinations of items which meet the energy consumption or conservation objective, for every combination which includes a covered product the efficiency of which exceeds either standard or level referred to in subparagraph (D), there also shall be at least one combination which includes such covered product the efficiency of which does not exceed such standard or level by more than 5 percent, except that at least one combination shall include such covered product the efficiency of which meets but does not exceed such standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The energy consumption or conservation objective is specified in terms of an estimated total consumption of energy (which may be calculated from energy loss- or gain-based codes) utilizing an equivalent amount of energy (which may be specified in units of energy or its equivalent cost).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The estimated energy use of any covered product permitted or required in the code, or used in calculating the objective, is determined using the applicable test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title, except that the State may permit the estimated energy use calculation to be adjusted to reflect the conditions of the areas where the code is being applied if such adjustment is based on the use of the applicable test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title or other technically accurate documented procedure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), a State or local government is not required to submit a petition to the Secretary in order to enforce or apply its building code or to establish that the code meets the conditions set forth in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a building code requires the installation of covered products with efficiencies exceeding both the applicable Federal standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title and the applicable standard of such State, if any, that has been granted a waiver under subsection (d) of this section, such requirement of the building code shall not be applicable unless the Secretary has granted a waiver for such requirement under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3993 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) No warranty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any disclosure with respect to energy use, energy efficiency, or estimated annual operating cost which is required to be made under the provisions of this part shall not create an express or implied warranty under State or Federal law that such energy efficiency will be achieved or that such energy use or estimated annual operating cost will not be exceeded under conditions of actual use.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, any person who knowingly violates any provision of section 6302 of this title shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $100 for each violation. Such penalties shall be assessed by the Commission, except that penalties for violations of section 6302(a)(3) of this title which relate to requirements prescribed by the Secretary, violations of section 6302(a)(4) of this title which relate to requests of the Secretary under section 6296(b)(2) of this title, or violations of section 6302(a)(5) of this title shall be assessed by the Secretary. Civil penalties assessed under this part may be compromised by the agency or officer authorized to assess the penalty, taking into account the nature and degree of the violation and the impact of the penalty upon a particular respondent. Each violation of paragraph (1), (2), or (5) of section 6302(a) of this title shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each covered product, and each day of violation of section 6302(a)(3) or (4) of this title shall constitute a separate violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Knowingly&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in subsection (a) of this section, the term &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; means (1) the having of actual knowledge, or (2) the presumed having of knowledge deemed to be possessed by a reasonable man who acts in the circumstances, including knowledge obtainable upon the exercise of due care.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce (within the meaning of section 45(a)(1) of title 15) for any person to violate section 6293(c) of this title, except to the extent that such violation is prohibited under the provisions of section 6302(a)(1) of this title, in which case such provisions shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedure for assessing penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty against any person under this section, the Secretary shall provide to such person notice of the proposed penalty. Such notice shall inform such person of his opportunity to elect in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice to have the procedures of paragraph (3) (in lieu of those of paragraph (2)) apply with respect to such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Unless an election is made within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice under paragraph (1) to have paragraph (3) apply with respect to such penalty, the Secretary shall assess the penalty, by order, after a determination of violation has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant to section 554 of title 5 before an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. Such assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's findings and the basis for such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this paragraph may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the Secretary assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United States court of appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary, or the court may remand the proceeding to the Secretary for such further action as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the procedures of this paragraph have been elected, the Secretary shall promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of the notice under paragraph (1) of the proposed penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the civil penalty has not been paid within 60 calendar days after the assessment order has been made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall institute an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for an order affirming the assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to review de novo the law and the facts involved, and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (2), or after the appropriate district court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall institute an action to recover the amount of such penalty in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of title 28 or section 7192(c) of this title, the Secretary shall be represented by the general counsel of the Department of Energy (or any attorney or attorneys within the Department of Energy designated by the Secretary) who shall supervise, conduct, and argue any civil litigation to which paragraph (3) of this subsection applies (including any related collection action under paragraph (4)) in a court of the United States or in any other court, except the Supreme Court. However, the Secretary or the general counsel shall consult with the Attorney General concerning such litigation, and the Attorney General shall provide, on request, such assistance in the conduct of such litigation as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to the provisions of section 7192(c) of this title, the Secretary shall be represented by the Attorney General, or the Solicitor General, as appropriate, in actions under this subsection, except to the extent provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Section 7172(d) of this title shall not apply with respect to the functions of the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of applying the preceding provisions of this subsection in the case of the assessment of a penalty by the Commission for a violation of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 6302 of this title, references in such provisions to &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Department of Energy&rdquo; shall <!-- PDFPage:3996 -->be considered to be references to the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard under this paragraph which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a covered product. The Secretary may not prescribe an amended standard under this subparagraph if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that a standard is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States in any product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some types (or classes) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a standard for other types or classes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) A standard amended by the Secretary under this paragraph shall become effective for products manufactured&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, packaged terminal air conditioners, packaged terminal heat pumps, warm-air furnaces, packaged boilers, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and unfired hot water storage tanks, on or after a date which is two years after the effective date of the applicable minimum energy efficiency requirement in the amended ASHRAE/IES standard referred to in subparagraph (A); and</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the achievement of long-term energy security for the United States is essential to the health of the national economy, the well-being of our citizens, and the maintenance of national security;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the displacement of energy derived from imported oil with alternative fuels will help to achieve energy security and improve air quality;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) transportation uses account for more than 60 percent of the oil consumption of the Nation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Nation's security, economic, and environmental interests require that the Federal Government should assist clean-burning, nonpetroleum transportation fuels to reach a threshold level of commercial application and consumer acceptability at which they can successfully compete with petroleum-based fuels;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) methanol, ethanol, and natural gas are proven transportation fuels that burn more cleanly and efficiently than gasoline and diesel fuel;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the production and use as transportation fuels of ethanol, methanol made from natural gas or biomass, and compressed natural gas have been estimated in some studies to release less carbon dioxide than comparable quantities of petroleum-based fuel;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the amount of carbon dioxide released with methanol from a coal-to-methanol industry using currently available technologies has been estimated in some studies to be significantly greater than the amount released with a comparable quantity of petroleum-based fuel;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) there exists evidence that manmade pollution&mdash;the release of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, and other trace gases into the atmosphere&mdash;may be producing a long term and substantial increase in the average temperature on Earth, a phenomenon known as global warming through the greenhouse effect; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) ongoing pollution and deforestation may be contributing now to an irreversible process producing unacceptable global climate changes; necessary actions must be identified and implemented in time to protect the climate, including the development of technologies to control increased carbon dioxide emissions that result with methanol from a coal-to-methanol industry.&rdquo;</p>
