<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 1 PREAMBLE</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section 101. <em>Federal Leadership</em></cap-smallcap>. The purpose of this order is to ensure that the Federal Government exercises leadership in the reduction of petroleum consumption through improvements in fleet fuel efficiency and the use of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) and alternative fuels. Reduced petroleum use and the displacement of petroleum by alternative fuels will help promote markets for more alternative fuel and fuel efficient vehicles, encourage new technologies, enhance the United States&rsquo; energy self-sufficiency and security, and ensure a healthier environment through the reduction of greenhouse gases and other pollutants in the atmosphere.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 2 GOALS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 201. <em>Reduced Petroleum Fuel Consumption</em>. Each agency operating 20 or more motor vehicles within the United States shall reduce its entire vehicle fleet's annual petroleum consumption by at least 20 percent by the end of FY 2005, compared with FY 1999 petroleum consumption levels.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 202. <em>Performance Strategies</em>. Agencies have numerous options for developing a strategy to meet the petroleum reduction levels established in section 201 of this order. Measures include: the use of alternative fuels in light, medium, and heavy-duty vehicles; the acquisition of vehicles with higher fuel economy, including hybrid vehicles; the substitution of cars for light trucks; an increase in vehicle load factors; a decrease in vehicle miles traveled; and a decrease in fleet size. Each agency will need a strategy that includes most, if not all, of these measures, but can develop a strategy that fits its unique fleet configuration and mission requirements. As part of the strategy, each agency should attempt to accelerate the introduction of vehicles meeting Tier 2 standards. Where feasible, agencies should also consider procurement of innovative vehicles, such as hybrid electric vehicles, capable of large improvements in fuel economy. The strategy should also attempt to minimize costs in achieving the objectives of this order. In developing its strategy, each agency shall include the following:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) AFV Acquisition and Use of Alternative Fuels. Each agency shall fulfill the acquisition requirements for AFVs established by section 303 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13212]. Agencies shall use alternative fuels to meet a majority of the fuel requirements of those motor vehicles by the end of FY 2005. Section 402 of this order addresses related issues of alternative fuel infrastructure availability and the ability to track alternative fuel usage data; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Acquisition of Higher Fuel Economy Vehicles. Agencies shall increase the average EPA fuel economy rating of passenger cars and light trucks acquired by at least 1 mile per gallon (mpg) by the end of FY 2002 and at least 3 mpg by the end of FY 2005 compared to FY 1999 acquisitions.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 3 ORGANIZATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY</h4>

<p class="note-body-1em">(1) Agencies shall be allowed to replace their conventionally-fueled vehicles with AFVs by making an initial lump-sum payment for the additional acquisition cost of the AFV and shall be allowed to contribute to the higher replacement costs of the AFV incrementally over the term of the lease, and have the option of averaging AFV incremental costs across the agency fleet as provided by the Energy Policy Act of 1992.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) Within 120 days of this order, the Administrator of GSA, in consultation with other agencies, shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(A) provide a summary of agency AFV acquisition plans to potential AFV manufacturers to assist in their production planning.

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 4 IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 401. <em>Vehicle Reporting Credits</em>. When preparing the annual report to DOE and OMB, each agency acquisition of an alternative fuel light-duty vehicle, regardless of geographic placement, shall count as one credit towards fulfilling the AFV acquisition requirements of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Agencies shall receive one additional credit for each light-duty AFV that exclusively uses an alternative fuel and for each Zero Emission Vehicle of any size. Agencies shall receive three credits for dedicated medium-duty AFVs and four credits for dedicated heavy-duty AFVs. Agencies can also receive one credit for every 450 gallons of pure bio-diesel used in diesel vehicles.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 402. <em>Infrastructure</em>. To support the use of alternative fuel in AFVs, agencies should arrange for fueling at commercial facilities that offer alternative fuels for sale to the public.</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Agencies should team with State, local, and private entities to support the expansion and use of public access alternative fuel refueling stations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agencies should use the authority granted to them in section 304 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 13213] to establish nonpublic access alternative fuel infrastructure for fueling Federal AFVs where public fueling is unavailable.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Agencies are encouraged to work with DOE and GSA to resolve alternative fuel usage tracking issues with alternative and petroleum fuel providers.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 403. <em>Procurement of Environmentally Preferable Motor Vehicle Products.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Consistent with Executive Order 13101 [42 U.S.C. 6961 note] and section 6002 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA), 42 U.S.C. 6962, effective 6 months after the date of this order, no Federal agency shall purchase, sell, or arrange for the purchase of vir<!-- PDFPage:6319 -->gin petroleum motor vehicle lubricating oils when re-refined motor vehicle lubricating oils are reasonably available and meet the vehicle manufacturer's recommended performance standards.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Consistent with Executive Order 13101 and RCRA section 6962, in acquiring and maintaining motor vehicles, agencies shall acquire and use United States EPA-designated Comprehensive Procurement Guideline items, including but not limited to retread tires, when such products are reasonably available and meet applicable performance standards. In addition, Federal agencies should consider acquiring other recycled content products, such as tires containing a minimum of 5&ndash;10 percent post-consumer recovered rubber.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Consistent with Executive Order 13101, Federal agencies are encouraged to use biobased motor vehicle products when such products are reasonably available and meet applicable performance standards.</p>

Department of Defense military tactical vehicles are exempt from this order. Law enforcement, emergency, and any other vehicle class or type determined by OMB, in consultation with DOE, are exempted from this order's requirements for Federal fleet fuel efficiency and alternative fuel vehicle acquisition. Agencies claiming vehicle exemptions must provide information on the number of each class or type of vehicle claimed as exempt as well as an estimate of total fuel consumption of exempt vehicles on an annual basis. Agencies should examine options for increasing fuel efficiency in these exempt vehicles and should report actions taken to increase fuel efficiency in these vehicles or fleets.
