<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than January 1, 2011, the Secretary shall develop a Physician Compare Internet website with information on physicians enrolled in the Medicare program under section 1866(j) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395cc(j)) and other eligible professionals who participate in the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative under section 1848 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w&ndash;4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than January 1, 2013, and with respect to reporting periods that begin no earlier than January 1, 2012, the Secretary shall <!-- PDFPage:2703 -->also implement a plan for making publicly available through Physician Compare, consistent with subsection (c), information on physician performance that provides comparable information for the public on quality and patient experience measures with respect to physicians enrolled in the Medicare program under such section 1866(j). To the extent scientifically sound measures that are developed consistent with the requirements of this section are available, such information, to the extent practicable, shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) measures collected under the Physician Quality Reporting Initiative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an assessment of patient health outcomes and the functional status of patients;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) processes by which a physician or other eligible professional whose performance on measures is being publicly reported has a reasonable opportunity, as determined by the Secretary, to review his or her individual results before they are made public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) processes by the Secretary to assure that the implementation of the plan and the data made available on Physician Compare provide a robust and accurate portrayal of a physician's performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) data that reflects the care provided to all patients seen by physicians, under both the Medicare program and, to the extent practicable, other payers, to the extent such information would provide a more accurate portrayal of physician performance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) processes to ensure appropriate attribution of care when multiple physicians and other providers are involved in the care of a patient;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) processes to ensure timely statistical performance feedback is provided to physicians concerning the data reported under any program subject to public reporting under this section; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consideration of transition to value-based purchasing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing the plan under this&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395w-5_2_target" name="1395w-5_2">2</a></sup> subsection (a)(2), the Secretary shall, as the Secretary determines appropriate, consider the plan to transition to a value-based purchasing program for physicians and other practitioners developed under section 131 of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008 (Public Law 110&ndash;275).</p>

In no case may Medicare beneficiaries be required to pay increased premiums or cost sharing or be subject to a reduction in benefits under title XVIII of the Social Security Act as a result of such demonstration program. The Secretary shall ensure that any such demonstration program does not disadvantage those beneficiaries without reasonable access to high performing physicians or create financial inequities under such title.</p>
