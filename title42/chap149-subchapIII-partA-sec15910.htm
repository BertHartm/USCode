<h3 class="section-head">&sect;15910. Enhanced oil and natural gas production through carbon dioxide injection</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Production incentive</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Approximately two-thirds of the original oil in place in the United States remains unproduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Enhanced oil and natural gas production from the sequestering of carbon dioxide and other appropriate gases has the potential to increase oil and natural gas production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Capturing and productively using carbon dioxide would help reduce the carbon intensity of the economy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:7866 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to promote the capturing, transportation, and injection of produced carbon dioxide, natural carbon dioxide, and other appropriate gases or other matter for sequestration into oil and gas fields; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to promote oil and natural gas production from the outer Continental Shelf and onshore Federal lands under lease by providing royalty incentives to use enhanced recovery techniques using injection of the substances referred to in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suspension of royalties</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that reduction of the royalty under a Federal oil and gas lease that is an eligible lease is in the public interest and promotes the purposes of this section, the Secretary shall undertake a rulemaking to provide for such reduction for an eligible lease.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rulemakings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall publish the advanced notice of proposed rulemaking within 180 days after August 8, 2005, and complete the rulemaking implementing this section within 365 days after August 8, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Eligible leases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A lease shall be an eligible lease for purposes of this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) it is a lease for production of oil and gas from the outer Continental Shelf or Federal onshore lands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the injection of the substances referred to in subsection (a)(2)(A) will be used as an enhanced recovery technique on such lease; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the Secretary determines that the lease contains oil or gas that would not likely be produced without the royalty reduction provided under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Amount of relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The rulemaking shall provide for a suspension volume, which shall not exceed 5,000,000 barrels of oil equivalent for each eligible lease. Such suspension volume shall be applied to any production from an eligible lease occurring on or after the date of publication of any advanced notice of proposed rulemaking under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may place limitations on the royalty reduction granted under this section based on market price.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section shall apply to any eligible lease issued before, on, or after August 8, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Demonstration program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of Energy shall establish a competitive grant program to provide grants to producers of oil and gas to carry out projects to inject carbon dioxide for the purpose of enhancing recovery of oil or natural gas while increasing the sequestration of carbon dioxide.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The demonstration program shall provide for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) not more than 10 projects in the Willistin Basin in North Dakota and Montana; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) 1 project in the Cook Inlet Basin in Alaska.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary of Energy shall issue requirements relating to applications for grants under paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an estimate of the production increase and the duration of the production increase from the project, as compared to conventional recovery techniques, including water flooding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an estimate of the carbon dioxide sequestered by project, over the life of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) a plan to collect and disseminate data relating to each project to be funded by the grant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) a description of the means by which the project will be sustainable without Federal assistance after the completion of the term of the grant;</p>
