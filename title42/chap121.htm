<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The international abduction or wrongful retention of children is harmful to their well-being.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Persons should not be permitted to obtain custody of children by virtue of their wrongful removal or retention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) International abductions and retentions of children are increasing, and only concerted cooperation pursuant to an international agreement can effectively combat this problem.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, done at The Hague on October 25, 1980, establishes legal rights and procedures for the prompt return of children who have been wrongfully removed or retained, as well as for securing the exercise of visitation rights. Children who are wrongfully removed or retained within the meaning of the Convention are to be promptly returned unless one of the narrow exceptions set forth in the Convention applies. The Convention provides a sound treaty framework to help resolve the problem of international abduction and retention of children and will deter such wrongful removals and retentions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declarations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress makes the following declarations:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures for the implementation of the Convention in the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The provisions of this chapter are in addition to and not in lieu of the provisions of the Convention.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In enacting this chapter the Congress recognizes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the international character of the Convention; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the need for uniform international interpretation of the Convention.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Convention and this chapter empower courts in the United States to deter<!-- PDFPage:5141 -->mine only rights under the Convention and not the merits of any underlying child custody claims.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In performing its functions under the Convention, the United States Central Authority may, under such conditions as the Central Authority prescribes by regulation, but subject to subsection (c) of this section, receive from or transmit to any department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government or of any State or foreign government, and receive from or transmit to any applicant, petitioner, or respondent, information necessary to locate a child or for the purpose of otherwise implementing the Convention with respect to a child, except that the United States Central Authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may receive such information from a Federal or State department, agency, or instrumentality only pursuant to applicable Federal and State statutes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may transmit any information received under this subsection notwithstanding any provision of law other than this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requests for information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Requests for information under this section shall be submitted in such manner and form as the United States Central Authority may prescribe by regulation and shall be accompanied or supported by such documents as the United States Central Authority may require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Responsibility of government entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States or of any State receives a request from the United States Central Authority for information authorized to be provided to such Central Authority under subsection (a) of this section, the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality shall promptly cause a search to be made of the files and records maintained by such department, agency, or instrumentality in order to determine whether the information requested is contained in any such files or records. If such search discloses the information requested, the head of such department, agency, or instrumentality shall immediately transmit such information to the United States Central Authority, except that any such information the disclosure of which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) would adversely affect the national security interests of the United States or the law enforcement interests of the United States or of any State; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) would be prohibited by section 9 of title 13;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
