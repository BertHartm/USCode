<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Actions authorized against imminent and substantial endangerment to health</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter the Administrator, upon receipt of information that a contaminant which is present in or is likely to enter a public water system or an underground source of drinking water, or that there is a threatened or potential terrorist attack (or other intentional act designed to disrupt the provision of safe drinking water or to impact adversely the safety of drinking water supplied to communities and individuals), which may present an imminent and substantial endangerment to the health of persons, and that appropriate State and local authorities have not acted to protect the health of such persons, may take such actions as he may deem necessary in order to protect the health of such persons. To the extent he determines it to be practicable in light of such imminent endangerment, he shall consult with the State and local authorities in order to confirm the correctness of the information on which action proposed to be taken under this subsection is based and to ascertain the action which such authorities are or will be taking. The action which the Administrator may take may include (but shall not be limited to) (1) issuing such orders as may be necessary to protect the health of persons who are or may be users of such system (including travelers), including orders requiring the provision of alternative water supplies by persons who caused or contributed to the endangerment, and (2) commencing a civil action for appropriate relief, including a restraining order or permanent or temporary injunction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Penalties for violations; separate offenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who violates or fails or refuses to comply with any order issued by the Administrator under subsection (a)(1) of this section may, in an action brought in the appropriate United States district court to enforce such order, be subject to a civil penalty of not to exceed $15,000 for each day in which such violation occurs or failure to comply continues.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Vulnerability assessments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each community water system serving a population of greater than 3,300 persons shall conduct an assessment of the vulnerability of its system to a terrorist attack or other intentional acts intended to substantially disrupt the ability of the system to provide a safe and reliable supply of drinking water. The vulnerability assessment shall include, but not be limited to, a review of pipes and constructed conveyances, physical barriers, water collection, pre<!-- PDFPage:874 -->treatment, treatment, storage and distribution facilities, electronic, computer or other automated systems which are utilized by the public water system, the use, storage, or handling of various chemicals, and the operation and maintenance of such system. The Administrator, not later than August 1, 2002, after consultation with appropriate departments and agencies of the Federal Government and with State and local governments, shall provide baseline information to community water systems required to conduct vulnerability assessments regarding which kinds of terrorist attacks or other intentional acts are the probable threats to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) substantially disrupt the ability of the system to provide a safe and reliable supply of drinking water; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) otherwise present significant public health concerns.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each community water system referred to in paragraph (1) shall certify to the Administrator that the system has conducted an assessment complying with paragraph (1) and shall submit to the Administrator a written copy of the assessment. Such certification and submission shall be made prior to:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) March 31, 2003, in the case of systems serving a population of 100,000 or more.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) June 30, 2004, in the case of systems serving a population greater than 3,300 but less than 50,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except for information contained in a certification under this subsection identifying the system submitting the certification and the date of the certification, all information provided to the Administrator under this subsection and all information derived therefrom shall be exempt from disclosure under section 552 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) No community water system shall be required under State or local law to provide an assessment described in this section to any State, regional, or local governmental entity solely by reason of the requirement set forth in paragraph (2) that the system submit such assessment to the Administrator.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Not later than November 30, 2002, the Administrator, in consultation with appropriate Federal law enforcement and intelligence officials, shall develop such protocols as may be necessary to protect the copies of the assessments required to be submitted under this subsection (and the information contained therein) from unauthorized disclosure. Such protocols shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) each copy of such assessment, and all information contained in or derived from the assessment, is kept in a secure location;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), an individual referred to in paragraph (5)(B) who is an officer or employee of the United States may discuss the contents of a vulnerability assessment submitted under this section with a State or local official.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in this section authorizes any person to withhold any information from Congress or from any committee or subcommittee of Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Emergency response plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each community water system serving a population greater than 3,300 shall prepare or revise, where necessary, an emergency response plan that incorporates the results of vulnerability assessments that have been completed. Each such community water system shall certify to the Administrator, as soon as reasonably possible after the enactment of this section, but not later than 6 months after the completion of the vulnerability assessment under subsection (a) of this section, that the system has completed such plan. The emergency response plan shall include, but not be limited to, plans, procedures, and identification of equipment that can be implemented or utilized in the event of a terrorist or other intentional attack on the public water system. The emergency response plan shall also include actions, procedures, and identification of equipment which can obviate or significantly lessen the impact of terrorist attacks or other intentional actions on the public health and the safety and supply of drinking water provided to communities and individuals. Community water systems shall, to the extent possible, coordinate with existing Local Emergency Planning Committees established under the Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11001 et seq.) when preparing or revising an emergency response plan under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Record maintenance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each community water system shall maintain a copy of the emergency response plan com<!-- PDFPage:875 -->pleted pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for 5 years after such plan has been certified to the Administrator under this section.</p>

Such basic security enhancements may include, but shall not be limited to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the purchase and installation of equipment for detection of intruders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the purchase and installation of fencing, gating, lighting, or security cameras;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the tamper-proofing of manhole covers, fire hydrants, and valve boxes;</p>
