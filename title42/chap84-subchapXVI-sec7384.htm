<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7384. Findings; sense of Congress</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5395 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Since World War II, Federal nuclear activities have been explicitly recognized under Federal law as activities that are ultra-hazardous. Nuclear weapons production and testing have involved unique dangers, including potential catastrophic nuclear accidents that private insurance carriers have not covered and recurring exposures to radioactive substances and beryllium that, even in small amounts, can cause medical harm.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Since the inception of the nuclear weapons program and for several decades afterwards, a large number of nuclear weapons workers at sites of the Department of Energy and at sites of vendors who supplied the Cold War effort were put at risk without their knowledge and consent for reasons that, documents reveal, were driven by fears of adverse publicity, liability, and employee demands for hazardous duty pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Many previously secret records have documented unmonitored exposures to radiation and beryllium and continuing problems at these sites across the Nation, at which the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies have been, since World War II, self-regulating with respect to nuclear safety and occupational safety and health. No other hazardous Federal activity has been permitted to be carried out under such sweeping powers of self-regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The policy of the Department of Energy has been to litigate occupational illness claims, which has deterred workers from filing workers&rsquo; compensation claims and has imposed major financial burdens for such employees who have sought compensation. Contractors of the Department have been held harmless and the employees have been denied workers&rsquo; compensation coverage for occupational disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Over the past 20 years, more than two dozen scientific findings have emerged that indicate that certain of such employees are experiencing increased risks of dying from cancer and non-malignant diseases. Several of these studies have also established a correlation between excess diseases and exposure to radiation and beryllium.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) While linking exposure to occupational hazards with the development of occupational disease is sometimes difficult, scientific evidence supports the conclusion that occupational exposure to dust particles or vapor of beryllium can cause beryllium sensitivity and chronic beryllium disease. Furthermore, studies indicate than 98 percent of radiation-induced cancers within the nuclear weapons complex have occurred at dose levels below existing maximum safe thresholds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Existing information indicates that State workers&rsquo; compensation programs do not provide a uniform means of ensuring adequate compensation for the types of occupational illnesses and diseases that relate to the employees at those sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To ensure fairness and equity, the civilian men and women who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies should have efficient, uniform, and adequate compensation for beryllium-related health conditions and radiation-related health conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) On April 12, 2000, the Secretary of Energy announced that the Administration intended to seek compensation for individuals with a broad range of work-related illnesses throughout the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) However, as of October 2, 2000, the Administration has failed to provide Congress with the necessary legislative and budget proposals to enact the promised compensation program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a program should be established to provide compensation to covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a fund for payment of such compensation should be established on the books of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) payments from that fund should be made only after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the identification of employees of the Department of Energy (including its predecessor agencies), and of contractors of the Department, who may be members of the group of covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of a process to receive and administer claims for compensation for disability or death of covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the submittal by the President of a legislative proposal for compensation of such employees that includes the estimated annual budget resources for that compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consideration by the Congress of the legislative proposal submitted by the President; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) payments from that fund should commence not later than fiscal year 2002.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13179. Providing Compensation to America's Nuclear Weapons Workers</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13179, Dec. 7, 2000, 65 F.R. 77487, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including Public Law 106&ndash;398, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.] (Public Law 106&ndash;398, the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), and to allocate the responsibilities imposed by that legislation and to provide for further legislative efforts, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women have served their Nation in building its nuclear defense. In the course of their work, they overcame previously unimagined scientific and technical challenges. Thousands of these courageous Americans, however, paid a high price for their service, developing disabling or fatal illnesses as a result of exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards unique to nuclear weapons production and testing. Too often, these workers were neither adequately protected from, nor informed of, the occupational hazards to which they were exposed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Existing workers&rsquo; compensation programs have failed to provide for the needs of these workers and their families. Federal workers&rsquo; compensation programs have generally not included these workers. Further, because of long latency periods, the uniqueness of the hazards to which they were exposed, and inadequate exposure data, many of these individuals have been unable to obtain State workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. This problem has been exacerbated by the past policy of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessors of encouraging and assisting DOE contractors in opposing the claims of workers who sought those benefits. This policy has recently been reversed.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the Nation can never fully repay these workers or their families, they deserve recognition and compensation for their sacrifices. Since the Administration's historic announcement in July of 1999 that it intended to compensate DOE nuclear weapons workers who suffered occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to the unique hazards in building the Nation's nuclear defense, it has been the policy of this Administration to support fair and timely compensation for these workers and their survivors. The Federal Government should provide necessary information and otherwise help employees of the DOE or its contractors determine if their illnesses are associated with conditions of their nuclear weapons-related work; it should provide workers and their survivors with all pertinent and available information necessary for evaluating and processing claims; and it should ensure that this program minimizes the administrative burden on workers and their survivors, and respects their dignity and privacy. This order sets out agency responsibilities to accomplish these goals, building on the Administration's articulated principles and the framework set forth in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.]. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Energy shall be responsible for developing and implementing actions under the Act to compensate these workers and their families in a manner that is compassionate, fair, and timely. Other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall assist in this effort.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Designation of Responsibilities for Administering the Energy Employees&rsquo; Occupational Illness Compensation Program (&ldquo;Program&rdquo;).</em></p>

<p class="note-body">(v) Pursuant to Subtitle D of the Act [42 U.S.C. 7385<em>o</em>], negotiate agreements with the chief executive officer of each State in which there is a DOE facility, and other States as appropriate, to provide assistance to a DOE contractor employee on filing a State workers&rsquo; compensation system claim, and establish a Worker Assistance Program to help individuals whose illness is related to employment in the DOE's nuclear weapons complex, or the individual's survivor if the individual is deceased, in applying for State workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. This assistance shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Submittal of reasonable claims to a physician panel, appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and administered by the Secretary of Energy, under procedures established by the Secretary of Energy, for determination of whether the individual's illness or death arose out of and in the course of employment by the DOE or its contractors and exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) For cases determined by the physician panel and the Secretary of Energy under section 3661(d) and (e) of the Act [42 U.S.C. 7385<em>o</em>(d), (e)] to have arisen out of and in the course of employment by the DOE or its contractors and exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility, provide assistance to the individual in filing for workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. The Secretary shall not contest these claims and, to the extent permitted by law, shall direct a DOE contractor who employed the applicant not to contest the claim;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) Report on the Worker Assistance Program by making publicly available on at least an annual basis claims-related data, including the number of claims filed, the number of illnesses found to be related to work at a DOE facility, job location and description, and number of successful State workers&rsquo; compensation claims awarded; and</p>
