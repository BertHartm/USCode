<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall support a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application for enhanced geothermal systems, including the programs described in subsection (b).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Enhanced geothermal systems technologies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall support a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application of the technologies and knowledge necessary for enhanced geothermal systems to advance to a state of commercial readiness, including advances in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reservoir stimulation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reservoir characterization, monitoring, and modeling;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) stress mapping;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) tracer development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) three-dimensional tomography; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) understanding seismic effects of reservoir engineering and stimulation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Enhanced geothermal systems reservoir stimulation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In collaboration with industry partners, the Secretary shall support a program of research, development, and demonstration of enhanced geothermal systems reservoir stimulation technologies and techniques. A minimum of 4 sites shall be selected in locations that show particular promise for enhanced geothermal systems development. Each site shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) represent a different class of subsurface geologic environments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) take advantage of an existing site where subsurface characterization has been conducted or existing drill holes can be utilized, if possible.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consideration of existing site</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Desert Peak, Nevada, site, where a Department of Energy and industry cooperative enhanced geothermal systems project is <!-- PDFPage:7675 -->already underway, may be considered for inclusion among the sites selected under subparagraph (A).</p>
