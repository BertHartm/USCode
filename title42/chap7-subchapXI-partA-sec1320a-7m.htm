<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Use in the Medicare fee-for-service program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall use predictive modeling and other analytics technologies (in this section referred to as &ldquo;predictive analytics technologies&rdquo;) to identify improper claims for reimbursement and to prevent the payment of such claims under the Medicare fee-for-service program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Predictive analytics technologies requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The predictive analytics technologies used by the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) capture Medicare provider and Medicare beneficiary activities across the Medicare fee-for-service program to provide a comprehensive view across all providers, beneficiaries, and geographies within such program in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify and analyze Medicare provider networks, provider billing patterns, and beneficiary utilization patterns; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) identify and detect any such patterns and networks that represent a high risk of fraudulent activity;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be integrated into the existing Medicare fee-for-service program claims flow with minimal effort and maximum efficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) be able to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) analyze large data sets for unusual or suspicious patterns or anomalies or contain other factors that are linked to the occurrence of waste, fraud, or abuse;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) undertake such analysis before payment is made; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) prioritize such identified transactions for additional review before payment is made in terms of the likelihood of potential waste, fraud, and abuse to more efficiently utilize investigative resources;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) capture outcome information on adjudicated claims for reimbursement to allow for refinement and enhancement of the predictive analytics technologies on the basis of such outcome information, including post-payment information about the eventual status of a claim; and</p>
