<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide for implementation by the United States of the Convention;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to protect the rights of, and prevent abuses against, children, birth families, and adoptive parents involved in adoptions (or prospective adoptions) subject to the Convention, and to ensure that such adoptions are in the children's best interests; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to improve the ability of the Federal Government to assist United States citizens seeking to adopt children from abroad and residents of other countries party to the Convention seeking to adopt children from the United States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Oversight of accrediting entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) monitor the performance by each accrediting entity of its duties under section 14922 of this title and its compliance with the requirements of the Convention, this chapter, other applicable laws, and implementing regulations under this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) suspend or cancel the designation of an accrediting entity found to be substantially out of compliance with the Convention, this chapter, other applicable laws, or implementing regulations under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suspension or cancellation of accreditation or approval</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Secretary's authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall suspend or cancel the accreditation or approval granted by an accrediting entity to an agency or person pursuant to section 14922 of this title when the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the agency or person is substantially out of compliance with applicable requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the accrediting entity has failed or refused, after consultation with the Secretary, to take appropriate enforcement action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Correction of deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time when the Secretary is satisfied that the deficiencies on the basis of which an adverse action is taken under paragraph (1) have been corrected, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) there is substantial evidence that the agency or person is out of compliance with applicable requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there has been a pattern of serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to comply or other aggravating circumstances indicating that continued accreditation or approval would not be in the best interests of the children and families concerned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period of debarment</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of debarment</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A person (other than a prospective adoptive parent), an agency, or an accrediting entity who is the subject of a final action of suspension, cancellation, or debarment by the Secretary under this subchapter may petition the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or the United States district court in the judicial district in which the person resides or the agency or accrediting entity is located to set aside the action.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Repeated serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to comply with the requirements of section 14923(b)(1)(A)(ii) of this title by an agency or person after consultation between Secretary and the accrediting entity with respect to previous noncompliance by such agency or person shall constitute a pattern of serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to comply under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to comply with certain requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A failure to comply with the requirements of section 14923(b)(1)(A)(ii) of this title shall constitute a serious failure to comply under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that such noncompliance had neither the purpose nor the effect of determining the outcome of a decision or proceeding by a court or other competent authority in the United States or the child's country of origin.</p>
