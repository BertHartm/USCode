<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no such loan shall exceed the development cost or the value of the security, whichever is less;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such a loan may be made for a period of up to 30 years from the making of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such a loan, when made to a consumer cooperative for cooperative housing purposes, may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be made upon the condition that any person who is admitted as an eligible member and tenant of the cooperative may not subsequently be deprived of his membership or tenancy by reason of his no longer meeting the income eligibility requirements established by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">There is authorized to be appropriated not to exceed $50,000,000, which shall constitute a revolving fund to be used by the Secretary in carrying out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Insurance of loans; authorization; terms and conditions; utilization of Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to insure and make commitments to insure loans made to any individual, corporation, association, trust, Indian tribe, or partnership to provide rental or cooperative housing and related facilities for elderly or handicapped persons or families or other persons and families of moderate income in rural areas, in accordance with terms and conditions substantially identical with those specified in section 1472 of this title; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no such loan shall exceed the development cost or the value of the security, whichever is less;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such a loan may be made for a period of up to 30 years from the making of the loan, but the Secretary may provide for periodic payments based on an amortization schedule of 50 years with a final payment of the balance due at the end of the term of the loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) for insuring such loans, the Secretary shall utilize the Agricultural Credit Insurance Fund subject to all the provisions of section 1929 of title 7 and the second and third sentences of section 1928&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1485_1_target" name="1485_1">1</a></sup> of title 7, including the authority in section 1929(f)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1485_1_target" name="1485_1">1</a></sup> of title 7 to uti<!-- PDFPage:3937 -->lize the insurance fund to make, sell, and insure loans which could be insured under this subsection; but the aggregate of the principal amounts of such loans made by the Secretary and not disposed of shall not exceed $10,000,000 outstanding at any one time; and the Secretary may take liens running to the United States though the notes may be held by other lenders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) such a loan, when made to a consumer cooperative for cooperative housing purposes, may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be made upon the condition that any person who is admitted as an eligible member and tenant of the cooperative may not subsequently be deprived of his membership or tenancy by reason of his no longer meeting the income eligibility requirements established by the Secretary;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) it is more cost-efficient and serves the tenant base more effectively to maintain the current property than to build a new property in the same location; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the property has been maintained to such an extent that it warrants retention in the current portfolio because it can be expected to continue providing decent, safe, and affordable rental units for the balance of the loan; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) current market studies show that a need for low-income rural rental housing still exists for that area; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall take actions to facilitate timely approval of requests to transfer ownership or control, for the purpose of rehabilitation or preservation, of multifamily housing projects for which assistance is provided by the Secretary of Agriculture in conjunction with any low-income housing tax credits under section 42 of title 26 or tax-exempt housing bonds.</p>
