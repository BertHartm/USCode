The Commissioner may from time to time alter the number and amounts of milestone payments initially established by the Commissioner pursuant to this section to the extent that the Commissioner determines that such an alteration would allow an adequate incentive for employment networks to assist beneficiaries to enter the workforce. Such alteration shall be based on information provided to the Commissioner by program managers, the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Advisory Panel established by section 101(f) of the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999, or other reliable sources.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;203, title IV, &sect;406, Mar. 2, 2004, 118 Stat. 527, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) [sic] GAO <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this Act [Mar. 2, 2004], the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a report to Congress regarding the Ticket to Work and Self-Sufficiency Program established under section 1148 of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1320b&ndash;19) that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) recommends such legislative or administrative changes as the Comptroller General determines are appropriate to improve the effectiveness of such program.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Findings and Purposes</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;170, &sect;2, Dec. 17, 1999, 113 Stat. 1862, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is the policy of the United States to provide assistance to individuals with disabilities to lead productive work lives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Health care is important to all Americans.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Health care is particularly important to individuals with disabilities and special health care needs who often cannot afford the insurance available to them through the private market, are uninsurable by the plans available in the private sector, and are at great risk of incurring very high and economically devastating health care costs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Americans with significant disabilities often are unable to obtain health care insurance that provides coverage of the services and supports that enable them to live independently and enter or rejoin the workforce. Personal assistance services (such as attendant services, personal assistance with transportation to and from work, reader services, job coaches, and related assistance) remove many of the barriers between significant disability and work. Coverage for such services, as well as for prescription drugs, durable medical equipment, and basic health care are powerful and proven tools for individuals with significant disabilities to obtain and retain employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) For individuals with disabilities, the fear of losing health care and related services is one of the greatest barriers keeping the individuals from maximizing their employment, earning potential, and independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries risk losing medicare or medicaid coverage that is linked to their cash benefits, a risk that is an equal, or greater, work disincentive than the loss of cash benefits associated with working.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Individuals with disabilities have greater opportunities for employment than ever before, aided by important public policy initiatives such as the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.), advancements in public understanding of disability, and innovations in assistive technology, medical treatment, and rehabilitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Despite such historic opportunities and the desire of millions of disability recipients to work and support themselves, fewer than one-half of one percent of Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income beneficiaries leave the disability rolls and return to work.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) In addition to the fear of loss of health care coverage, beneficiaries cite financial disincentives to work and earn income and lack of adequate employment training and placement services as barriers to employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Eliminating such barriers to work by creating financial incentives to work and by providing individuals with disabilities real choice in obtaining the services and technology they need to find, enter, and maintain employment can greatly improve their short and long-term financial independence and personal well-being.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In addition to the enormous advantages such changes promise for individuals with disabilities, redesigning government programs to help individuals with disabilities return to work may result in significant savings and extend the life of the Social Security Disability Insurance Trust Fund.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) If only an additional one-half of one percent of the current Social Security Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income recipients were to cease receiving benefits as a result of employment, the savings to the Social Security Trust Funds and to <!-- PDFPage:1880 -->the Treasury in cash assistance would total $3,500,000,000 over the worklife of such individuals, far exceeding the cost of providing incentives and services needed to assist them in entering work and achieving financial independence to the best of their abilities.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Purposes</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purposes of this Act [see Tables for classification] are as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) To provide health care and employment preparation and placement services to individuals with disabilities that will enable those individuals to reduce their dependency on cash benefit programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) To encourage States to adopt the option of allowing individuals with disabilities to purchase medicaid coverage that is necessary to enable such individuals to maintain employment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) To provide individuals with disabilities the option of maintaining medicare coverage while working.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To establish a return to work ticket program that will allow individuals with disabilities to seek the services necessary to obtain and retain employment and reduce their dependency on cash benefit programs.&rdquo;</p>
