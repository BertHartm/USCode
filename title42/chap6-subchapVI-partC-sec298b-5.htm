<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Computation of base amount and interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The base amount that the United States is entitled to recover under subsection (a) of this <!-- PDFPage:550 -->section is the amount bearing the same ratio to the then value (as determined by the agreement of the parties or in an action brought in the district court of the United States for the district in which the facility is situated) of the facility as the amount of the Federal participation bore to the cost of the construction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The interest that the United States is entitled to recover under subsection (a) of this section is the interest for the period (if any) described in subparagraph (B) at a rate (determined by the Secretary) based on the average of the bond equivalent rates of 91-day Treasury bills auctioned during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The period referred to in subparagraph (A) is the period beginning&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if notice is not provided as prescribed by subsection (b) of this section, 11 days after the date on which such cessation or change of use occurs,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and ending on the date the amount the United States is entitled to recover is collected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of recovery rights of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may waive the recovery rights of the United States under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to a facility (under such conditions as the Secretary may establish by regulation) if the Secretary determines that there is good cause for waiving such rights.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Nature of prejudgment right of recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The right of recovery of the United States under subsection (a) of this section shall not, prior to judgment, constitute a lien on any facility.</p>
