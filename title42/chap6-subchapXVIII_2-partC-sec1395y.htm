In carrying out any such study, the Secretary may not reveal any specific information which identifies any pacemaker device or lead recipient by name (or which would otherwise identify a specific recipient).</p>

In any case where the Secretary has reason to believe, based upon information in the pacemaker registry or otherwise available to him, that replacement of a cardiac pacemaker device or lead for which payment is or may be requested under this subchapter is related to the malfunction of a device or lead, the Secretary may require that personnel of the Food and Drug Administration be present at the testing of such device by the manufacturer, to determine whether such device was functioning properly.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may deny payment under this subchapter, in whole or in part and for such period of time as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, with respect to the implantation or replacement of a pacemaker device or lead of a manufacturer performed by a physician and provider of services after the Secretary determines (in accordance with the procedures established under subsections (c), (f), and (g) of section 1320a&ndash;7 of this title) that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to supplement the activities of the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission under section 1395ww(e) of this title in assessing the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of new and existing medical procedures, the Secretary may carry out, or award grants or contracts for, original research and experimentation of the type described in clause (ii) of section 1395ww(e)(6)(E) of this title with respect to such a procedure if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such procedure is not of sufficient commercial value to justify research and experimentation by a commercial organization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) research and experimentation with respect to such procedure is not of a type that may appropriately be carried out by an institute, division, or bureau of the National Institutes of Health; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such procedure has the potential to be more cost-effective in the treatment of a condition than procedures currently in use with respect to such condition.</p>
