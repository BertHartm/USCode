<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suitability for conversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In evaluating the suitability of a military installation for conversion into a Federal prison facility, the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney General shall consider the estimated cost to convert the installation into a prison facility and such other factors as the Secretary and the Attorney General consider to be appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consider whether using any portion of a military installation closed or scheduled to be closed in the region pursuant to a base closure law provides a cost-effective alternative to the purchase of real property or construction of new prison facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consider whether such use is consistent with a reutilization and redevelopment plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) give consideration to any installation located in a rural area the closure of which will have a substantial adverse impact on the economy of the local communities and on the ability of the communities to sustain an economic recovery from such closure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With regard to paragraph (1)(B), consent must be obtained from the local re-use authority for the military installation, recognized and funded by the Secretary of Defense, before the Attorney General may proceed with plans for the design or construction of a prison at the installation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before proceeding with plans for the design or construction of a Federal prison, the Attorney General shall submit to Congress a report explaining the basis of the decision on where to locate the new prison facility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Report on cost-effectiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Attorney General decides not to utilize any portion of a closed military installation or an installation scheduled to be closed for locating a prison, the report shall include an analysis of why installations in the region, the use of which as a prison would be consistent with a reutilization and redevelopment plan, does not provide a cost-effective alternative to the purchase of real property or construction of new prison facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Base closure law&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, &ldquo;base closure law&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;13726. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Increasingly, States are turning to private prisoner transport companies as an alternative to their own personnel or the United States Marshals Service when transporting violent prisoners.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The transport process can last for days if not weeks, as violent prisoners are dropped off and picked up at a network of hubs across the country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Escapes by violent prisoners during transport by private prisoner transport companies have occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Oversight by the Attorney General is required to address these problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) While most governmental entities may prefer to use, and will continue to use, fully trained and sworn law enforcement officers when transporting violent prisoners, fiscal or logistical concerns may make the use of highly specialized private prisoner transport companies an option. Nothing in sections 13726 to 13726c of this title should be construed to mean that governmental entities should contract with private prisoner transport companies to move violent prisoners; however when a government entity opts to use a private prisoner transport company to move violent prisoners, then the company should be subject to regulation in order to enhance public safety.</p>
