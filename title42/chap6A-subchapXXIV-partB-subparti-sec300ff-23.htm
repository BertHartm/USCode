<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the service plan established under subsection (c)(2) of this section by such consortium is consistent with the comprehensive plan under section 300ff&ndash;27(b)(4) of this title and addresses the special care and service needs of the populations and subpopulations identified under subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) except as provided in paragraph (2), the consortium will be a single coordinating entity that will integrate the delivery of services among the populations and subpopulations identified under subparagraph (A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such unique service requirements cannot be adequately and efficiently addressed by a single consortium serving the entire community or locality.</p>
