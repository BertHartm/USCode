<p class="statutory-body">To afford maximum access to the polls by absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters, it is recommended that the States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) use the official post card form (prescribed under section 1973ff of this title) for simultaneous voter registration application and absentee ballot application;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adopt the suggested design for absentee ballot mailing envelopes prescribed under section 1973ff of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) waive registration requirements for absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters who, by reason of service or residence, do not have an opportunity to register;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if an application other than an official post card form (prescribed under section 1973ff of this title) is required for absentee registration, provide that registration forms be sent with the absentee ballot and may be returned with it;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) expedite processing of balloting materials with respect to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) permit any oath required for a document under this subchapter to be administered by a commissioned officer of the Armed Forces or any official authorized to administer oaths under Federal law or the law of the State or other place where the oath is administered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) assure that absentee ballots are mailed to absent uniformed services voters and overseas voters at the earliest opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) assist the Presidential designee in compiling statistical and other information relating to this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) provide late registration procedures for persons recently separated from the Armed Forces.</p>
