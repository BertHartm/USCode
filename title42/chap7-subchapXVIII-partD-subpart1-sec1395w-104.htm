Under such an exception, a nonpreferred drug could be covered under the terms applicable for preferred drugs if the prescribing physician determines that the preferred drug for treatment of the same condition either would not be as effective for the individual or would have adverse effects for the individual or both. A PDP sponsor shall have an exceptions process under this paragraph consistent with guidelines established by the Secretary for making a determination with respect to such a request. Denial of such an exception shall be treated as a coverage denial for purposes of applying subsection (h) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Appeals</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

In applying this paragraph only the part D eligible individual shall be entitled to bring such an appeal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation in cases on nonformulary determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A part D eligible individual who is enrolled in a prescription drug plan offered by a PDP sponsor may appeal under paragraph (1) a determination not to provide for coverage of a covered part D drug that is not on the formulary under the plan only if the prescribing physician determines that all covered part D drugs on any tier of the formulary for treatment of the same condition would not be as effective for the individual as the nonformulary drug, would have adverse effects for the individual, or both.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of nonformulary determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a PDP sponsor determines that a plan provides coverage for a covered part D drug that is not on the formulary of the plan, the drug shall be treated as being included on the formulary for purposes of section 1395w&ndash;102(b)(4)(C)(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Privacy, confidentiality, and accuracy of enrollee records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of section 1395w&ndash;22(h) of this title shall apply to a PDP sponsor and prescription drug plan in the same manner as it applies to an MA organization and an MA plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Treatment of accreditation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subparagraph (A) of section 1395w&ndash;22(e)(4) of this title (relating to treatment of accreditation) shall apply to a PDP sponsor under this part with respect to the following requirements, in the same manner as it applies to an MA organization with respect to the requirements in subparagraph (B) (other than clause (vii) thereof) of such section:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Public disclosure of pharmaceutical prices for equivalent drugs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A PDP sponsor offering a prescription drug plan shall provide that each pharmacy that dispenses a covered part D drug shall inform an enrollee of any differential between the price of the drug to the enrollee and the price of the lowest priced generic covered part D drug under the plan that is therapeutically equivalent and bioequivalent and available at such pharmacy.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timing of notice</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (B), the information under paragraph (1) shall be provided at the time of purchase of the drug involved, or, in the case of dispensing by mail order, at the time of delivery of such drug.</p>
