<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The homebuyer (and spouse, where applicable) shall certify that the homebuyer has made a good faith effort to obtain a market rate mortgage and has been denied because the annual income of the homebuyer and the members of the family of the homebuyer residing with the homebuyer is insufficient.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Maximum interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The interest payable on the mortgage is established at a fixed rate that does not exceed a maximum rate of interest established by the Trust taking into consideration prevailing interest rates on similar mortgages.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Assistance payments under this subchapter shall be repayable from the net proceeds of the sale, without interest, upon the sale of the property for which the assistance payments are made. If the sale results in no net proceeds or the net proceeds are insufficient to repay the amount of the assistance payments in full, the Board of Directors shall release the lien to the extent that the debt secured by the lien remains unpaid.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Repayment upon increased income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the aggregate annual income of the homebuyer (and family of the homebuyer) assisted under this subchapter exceeds the applicable maximum income allowable under subsection (b)(2) of this section for any 2-year period after <!-- PDFPage:7064 -->such assistance is provided, the Board of Directors may provide for the repayment, on a monthly basis, of all or a portion of such assistance payments, based on the amount of assistance provided and the income of the homebuyer (and family of the homebuyer).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Trust may make assistance payments under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section with respect to a single mortgage of an eligible homebuyer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Allocation formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts available in any fiscal year for assistance under this subchapter shall be allocated for homebuyers in each State on the basis of the need of eligible first-time homebuyers in each State for such assistance in comparison with the need of eligible first-time homebuyers for such assistance among all States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assistance in connection with housing financed with mortgage revenue bonds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Trust shall provide assistance for first-time homebuyers in the form of interest rate buydowns and downpayment assistance under this subsection.
