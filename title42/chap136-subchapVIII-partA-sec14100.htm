<p class="note-body">Section 14099 of this title, referred to in par. (1)(A), was in the original &ldquo;section 106&rdquo;, and was translated as reading &ldquo;section 200110&rdquo;, meaning section 200110 of Pub. L. 103&ndash;322, to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because Pub. L. 103&ndash;322 does not contain a section 106, and section 14099 of this title relates to assignment of Police Corps participants.</p>
