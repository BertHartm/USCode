<p class="statutory-body">All grants-in-aid made from allocations made by the President under this section shall be made by the head of the department, agency, or instrumentality of the Federal Government administering the law authorizing such grants, and, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, shall be made in accordance with all of the provisions of such law except (1) provisions requiring allocation of funds among the States, and (2) limitations upon the total amount of such grants for any period. Notwithstanding any provisions of such law requiring the Federal contribution to the State or local government involved to be less than a fixed portion of the cost of a project, grants-in-aid may be made under authority of this section which bring the total of all Federal contributions to such project up to 50 per centum of the cost of such project, or up to 75 per centum of the cost of such project if the State or local government does not have economic and financial capacity to assume all of the additional financial obligations required.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of appropriations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) which will meet an essential public need;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a substantial portion of which can be completed within twelve months after initiation or acceleration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) which will contribute significantly to the reduction of local unemployment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) which are not inconsistent with locally approved comprehensive plans for the jurisdiction affected, wherever such plans exist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Limit on allocations available for projects in any one State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not more than 10 per centum of all amounts allocated by the President under this section shall be made available for public works projects within any one State.</p>
