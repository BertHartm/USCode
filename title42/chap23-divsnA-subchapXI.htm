<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the policy of the Commission to control the dissemination and declassification of Restricted Data in such a manner as to assure the common defense and security. Consistent with such policy, the Commission shall be guided by the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Until effective and enforceable international safeguards against the use of atomic energy for destructive purposes have been established by an international arrangement, there shall be no exchange of Restricted Data with other nations except as authorized by section 2164 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The dissemination of scientific and technical information relating to atomic energy should be permitted and encouraged so as to provide that free interchange of ideas and criticism which is essential to scientific and industrial progress and public understanding and to enlarge the fund of technical information.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall from time to time determine the data, within the definition of Restricted Data, which can be published without undue risk to the common defense and security and shall thereupon cause such data to be declassified and removed from the category of Restricted Data.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Continuous review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall maintain a continuous review of Restricted Data and of any Classification Guides issued for the guidance of those in the atomic energy program with respect to the areas of Restricted Data which have been declassified in order to determine which information may be declassified and removed from the category of Restricted Data without undue risk to the common defense and security.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Joint determination on atomic weapons; Presidential determination on disagreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of Restricted Data which the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly determine to relate primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons, the determination that such data may be published without constituting an unreasonable risk to the common defense and security shall be made by the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly, and if the Commission and the Department of Defense do not agree, the determination shall be made by the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Removal from Restricted Data category</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall remove from the Restricted Data category such data as the Commission and the Department of Defense jointly determine relates primarily to the military utilization of atomic weapons and which the Commission and Department of Defense jointly determine can be adequately safeguarded as defense information: <em>Provided, however</em>, That no such data so removed from the Restricted Data category shall be transmitted or otherwise made available to any nation or regional defense organization, while such data remains defense information, except pursuant to an agreement for cooperation entered into in accordance with subsection (b) or (d) of section 2164 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Joint determination on atomic energy programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall remove from the Restricted Data category such information concerning the atomic energy programs of other nations as the Commission and the Director of Central Intelligence jointly determine to be necessary to carry out the provisions of section 102(d) of the National Security Act of 1947, as amended,<sup><a href="#2162_1_target" name="2162_1">1</a></sup> and can be adequately safeguarded as defense information.</p>

<p class="note-body">2005&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 109&ndash;58, &sect;652(1), revised and restructured provisions of subsec. (a). Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows: &ldquo;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission (in this section referred to as the &lsquo;Commission&rsquo;) shall require each licensee or applicant for a license to operate a utilization facility under section 2133 or 2134(b) of this title to fingerprint each individual who is permitted unescorted access to the facility or is permitted access to safeguards information under section 2167 of this title. All fingerprints obtained by a licensee or applicant as required in the preceding sentence shall be submitted to the Attorney General of the United States through the Commission for identification and a criminal history records check. The costs of any identification and records check conducted pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be paid by the licensee or applicant. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Attorney General may provide all the results of the search to the Commission, and, in accordance with regulations prescribed under this section, the Commission may provide such results to the licensee or applicant submitting such fingerprints.&rdquo; Amendment by Pub. L. 109&ndash;58, &sect;652(1)(D), which misquoted the sentence to be stricken by leaving out the word &ldquo;the&rdquo; before &ldquo;licensee&rdquo;, was nevertheless executed to reflect the probable intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c). Pub. L. 109&ndash;58, &sect;652(2)(A), substituted &ldquo;requirements&mdash;&rdquo; for &ldquo;,&nbsp;subject to public notice and comment, regulations&mdash;&rdquo; in introductory provisions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c)(2)(B). Pub. L. 109&ndash;58, &sect;652(2)(B), substituted &ldquo;unescorted access to a utilization facility, radioactive material, or other property described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section&rdquo; for &ldquo;unescorted access to the facility of a licensee or applicant&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsecs. (d), (e). Pub. L. 109&ndash;58, &sect;652(3), (4), added subsec. (d) and redesignated former subsec. (d) as (e).</p>
