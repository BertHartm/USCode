<p class="statutory-body">Each cooperative agreement under section 7913 of this title shall require the State, where determined appropriate by the Secretary with the concurrence of the Commission, to acquire any designated processing site, including where appropriate any interest therein. In determining whether to require the State to acquire a designated processing site or interest therein, consideration shall be given to the prevention of windfall profits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disposition and stabilization site for residual radioactive materials; Federal site available</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary with the concurrence of the Commission determines that removal of residual radioactive material from a processing site is appropriate, the cooperative agreement shall provide that the State shall acquire land (including, where appropriate, any interest therein) to be used as a site for the permanent disposition and stabilization of such residual radioactive materials in a safe and environmentally sound manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Acquisition by the State shall not be required under this subsection if a site located on land controlled by the Secretary or made available by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to section 7916(2) of this title is designated by the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Commission, for such disposition and stabilization.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of each processing site designated under this subchapter other than a site designated on Indian land, the State shall take such action as may be necessary, and pursuant to regulations of the Secretary under this subsection, to assure that any person who purchases such a processing site after the removal of radioactive materials from such site shall be notified in an appropriate manner prior to such purchase, of the nature and extent of residual radioactive materials removed from the site, including notice of the date when such action took place, and the condition of such site after such action. If the State is the owner of such site, the State shall so notify any prospective purchaser before entering into a contract, option, or other arrangement to sell or otherwise dispose of such site. The Secretary shall issue appropriate rules and regulations to require notice in the local land records of the residual radioactive materials which were located at any processing site and notice of the nature and extent of residual radioactive materials removed from the site, including notice of the date when such action took place. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;site&rdquo; does not include any property described in section 7911(6)(B) of this title which is in a State which the Secretary has certified has a program which would achieve the purposes of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">No provision of any agreement under section 7913 of this title shall prohibit the Secretary of the Interior, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Energy and the Commission, from disposing of any subsurface mineral rights by sale or lease (in accordance with laws of the United States applicable to the sale, lease, or other disposal of such rights) which are associated with land on which residual radioactive materials are disposed and which are transferred to the United States as required under this section if the Secretary of the Interior takes such action as the Commission deems necessary pursuant to a license issued by the Commission to assure that the residual radioactive materials will not be disturbed by reason of any activity carried on following such disposition. If any such materials are disturbed by any such activity, the Secretary of the Interior shall insure, prior to the disposition of the minerals, that such materials will be restored to a safe and environmentally sound condition as determined by the Commission, and that the costs of such restoration will be borne by the person acquiring such rights from the Secretary of the Interior or from his successor or assign.</p>
