<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) over 2,000,000 reports of suspected child abuse and neglect are made each year, and drug abuse is associated with a significant portion of these;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the investigation and prosecution of child abuse cases is extremely complex, involving numerous agencies and dozens of personnel;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) traditionally, community agencies and professionals have different roles in the prevention, investigation, and intervention process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in such cases, too often the system does not pay sufficient attention to the needs and welfare of the child victim, aggravating the trauma that the child victim has already experienced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there is a national need to enhance coordination among community agencies and professionals involved in the intervention system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) multidisciplinary child abuse investigation and prosecution programs have been developed that increase the reporting of child abuse cases, reduce the trauma to the child victim, and increase the successful prosecution of child abuse offenders; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) such programs have proven effective, and with targeted Federal assistance, could be duplicated in many jurisdictions throughout the country.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a large number of juvenile and family courts are inundated with increasing numbers of cases due to increased reports of abuse and neglect, increasing drug-related maltreatment, and insufficient court resources;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:7489 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amendments made to the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 301 et seq.] by the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980 make substantial demands on the courts handling abuse and neglect cases, but provide no assistance to the courts to meet those demands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Adoption&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13021_1_target" name="13021_1">1</a></sup> and Child Welfare Act of 1980 requires courts to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) determine whether the agency made reasonable efforts to prevent foster care placement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) approve voluntary nonjudicial placement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide procedural safeguards for parents when their parent-child relationship is affected;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) social welfare agencies press the courts to meet such requirements, yet scarce resources often dictate that courts comply pro forma without undertaking the meaningful judicial inquiry contemplated by Congress in the Adoption&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13021_1_target" name="13021_1">1</a></sup> and Child Welfare Act of 1980;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) compliance with the Adoption&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13021_1_target" name="13021_1">1</a></sup> and Child Welfare Act of 1980 and overall improvements in the judicial response to abuse and neglect cases can best come about through action by top level court administrators and judges with administrative functions who understand the unique aspects of decisions required in child abuse and neglect cases; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Adoption&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13021_1_target" name="13021_1">1</a></sup> and Child Welfare Act of 1980 provides financial incentives to train welfare agency staff to meet the requirements, but provides no resources to train judges.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this subchapter is to provide expanded technical assistance and training to judicial personnel and attorneys, particularly personnel and practitioners in juvenile and family courts, to improve the judicial system's handling of child abuse and neglect cases with specific emphasis on the role of the courts in addressing reasonable efforts that can safely avoid unnecessary and unnecessarily prolonged foster care placement.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Agency designated to receive report and action to be taken</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For all Federal lands and all federally operated (or contracted) facilities in which children are cared for or reside, the Attorney General shall designate an agency to receive and investigate the reports described in subsection (a) of this section. By formal written agreement, the designated agency may be a non-Federal agency. When such reports are received by social services or health care agencies, and involve allegations of sexual abuse, serious physical injury, or life-threatening neglect of a child, there shall be an immediate referral of the report to a law enforcement agency with authority to take emergency action to protect the child. All reports received shall be promptly investigated, and whenever appropriate, investigations shall be conducted jointly by social services and law enforcement personnel, with a view toward avoiding unnecessary multiple interviews with the child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reporting form</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In every federally operated (or contracted) facility, and on all Federal lands, a standard written reporting form, with instructions, shall be disseminated to all mandated reporter groups.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each agency of the Federal Government, and every facility operated by the Federal Government (or operated under contract with the Federal Government), that hires (or contracts for hire) individuals involved with the provision to children under the age of 18 of child care services shall assure that all existing and newly-hired employees undergo a criminal history background check. All existing staff shall receive such checks not later than May 29, 1991. Except as provided in subsection (b)(3) of this section, no additional staff shall be hired without a check having been completed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;child care services&rdquo; means child protective services (including the investigation of child abuse and neglect reports), social services, health and mental health care, child (day) care, education (whether or not directly involved in teaching), foster care, residential care, recreational or rehabilitative programs, and detention, correctional, or treatment services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Criminal history check</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A background check required by subsection (a) of this section shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) based on a set of the employee's fingerprints obtained by a law enforcement officer and on other identifying information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) conducted through the Identification Division of the Federal Bureau of Investigation and through the State criminal history repositories of all States that an employee or prospective employee lists as current and former residences in an employment application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) initiated through the personnel programs of the applicable Federal agencies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The results of the background check shall be communicated to the employing agency.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:7492 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) An agency or facility described in subsection (a)(1) of this section may hire a staff person provisionally prior to the completion of a background check if, at all times prior to receipt of the background check during which children are in the care of the person, the person is within the sight and under the supervision of a staff person with respect to whom a background check has been completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicable criminal histories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any conviction for a sex crime, an offense involving a child victim, or a drug felony, may be ground for denying employment or for dismissal of an employee in any of the positions listed in subsection (a)(2) of this section. In the case of an incident in which an individual has been charged with one of those offenses, when the charge has not yet been disposed of, an employer may suspend an employee from having any contact with children while on the job until the case is resolved. Conviction of a crime other than a sex crime may be considered if it bears on an individual's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Employment applications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Employment applications for individuals who are seeking work for an agency of the Federal Government, or for a facility or program operated by (or through contract with) the Federal Government, in any of the positions listed in subsection (a)(1) of this section, shall contain a question asking whether the individual has ever been arrested for or charged with a crime involving a child, and if so requiring a description of the disposition of the arrest or charge. An application shall state that it is being signed under penalty of perjury, with the applicable Federal punishment for perjury stated on the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A Federal agency seeking a criminal history record check shall first obtain the signature of the employee or prospective employee indicating that the employee or prospective employee has been notified of the employer's obligation to require a record check as a condition of employment and the employee's right to obtain a copy of the criminal history report made available to the employing Federal agency and the right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in the report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Encouragement of voluntary criminal history checks for others who may have contact with children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Federal agencies and facilities are encouraged to submit identifying information for criminal history checks on volunteers working in any of the positions listed in subsection (a) of this section and on adult household members in places where child care or foster care services are being provided in a home.</p>
