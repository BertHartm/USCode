<p class="statutory-body">In promulgating rules, regulations, and procedures for assistance under this subchapter, the Secretary shall ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the relative needs of eligible areas are given adequate consideration by the Secretary, as determined based on, among other relevant factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the severity of the rates of unemployment in the eligible areas and the duration of the unemployment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the income levels and the extent of underemployment in eligible areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the outmigration of population from eligible areas and the extent to which the outmigration is causing economic injury in the eligible areas; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) allocations of assistance under this subchapter are prioritized to ensure that the level of economic distress of an area, rather than a preference for a geographic area or a specific type of economic distress, is the primary factor in allocating the assistance.</p>
