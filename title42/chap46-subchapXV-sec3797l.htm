<p class="statutory-body-1em">Seventy-five percent of the amount made available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year shall be allocated to each State that meets the requirements of section 3797k of this title so that each State shall receive an amount that bears the same ratio to the 75 percent of the total amount made available to carry out this subchapter for that fiscal year as the population of the State bears to the population of all States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Discretionary allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Twenty-five percent of the amount made available to carry out this subchapter in each fiscal year shall be allocated pursuant to the Attorney General's discretion to States with above average rates of part 1 violent crimes based on the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such State to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 most recent calendar years for which such data is available.</p>

Reductions under the preceding sentence shall be allocated among the States (other than States whose payment is determined under paragraph (3)) in the same proportions as amounts would be allocated under paragraph (1) without regard to paragraph (3).</p>
