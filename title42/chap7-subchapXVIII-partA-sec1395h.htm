<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for agreement by Secretary for implementation; scope of agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any group or association of providers of services wishes to have payments under this part to such providers made through a national, State, or other public or private agency or organization and nominates such agency or organization for this purpose, the Secretary is authorized to enter into an agreement with such agency or organization providing for the determination by such agency or organization (subject to the provisions of section 1395<em>oo</em> of this title and to such review by the Secretary as may be provided for by the agreement) of the amount of the payments required pursuant to this part to be made to such providers (and to providers assigned to such agency or organization under subsection (e) of this section), and for the making of such payments by such agency or organization to such providers (and to providers assigned to such agency or organization under subsection (e) of this section). Such agreement may also include provision for the agency or organization to do all or any part of the following: (1) to provide consultative services to institutions or agencies to enable them to establish and maintain fiscal records necessary for purposes of this part and otherwise to qualify as hospitals, extended care facilities, or home health agencies, and (2) with respect to the providers of services which are to receive payments through it (A) to serve as a center for, and communicate to providers, any information or instructions furnished to it by the Secretary, and serve as a channel of communication from providers to the Secretary; (B) to make such audits of the records of providers as may be necessary to insure that proper payments are made under this part; and (C) to perform such other functions as are necessary to carry out this subsection. As used in this subchapter and part B of subchapter XI of this chapter, the term &ldquo;fiscal intermediary&rdquo; means an agency or organization with a contract under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prerequisites for agreement or renewal of agreement by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not enter into or renew an agreement with any agency or organization under this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) he finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) after applying the standards, criteria, and procedures developed under subsection (f) of this section, that to do so is consistent with the effective and efficient administration of this part, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that such agency or organization is willing and able to assist the providers to which payments are made through it under this part in the application of safeguards against unnecessary utilization of services furnished by them to individuals entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title, and the agreement provides for such assistance; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such agency or organization agrees&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Terms and conditions of agreements; prompt payment of claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An agreement with any agency or organization under this section may contain such terms and conditions as the Secretary finds necessary or appropriate, may provide for advances of funds to the agency or organization for the making of payments by it under subsection (a) of this section, and shall provide for payment of so much of the cost of administration of the agency or organization as is determined by the Secretary to be necessary and proper for carrying out the functions covered by the agreement. The Secretary shall provide that in determining the necessary and proper cost of administration, the Secretary shall, with respect to each agreement, take into account the amount that is reasonable and adequate to meet the costs which must be incurred by an efficiently and economically operated agency or organization in carrying out the terms of its agreement. The Secretary shall cause to have published in the Federal Register, by not later than September 1 before each fiscal year, data, standards, and methodology to be used to establish budgets for fiscal intermediaries under this section for that fiscal year, and shall cause to be published in the Federal Register for public comment, at least 90 days before such data, standards, and methodology are published, the data, standards, and methodology proposed to be used. The Secretary may not require, as a condition of entering into or renewing an agreement under this section or under section 1395hh of this title, that a fiscal intermediary match data obtained other than in its activities under this part with data used in the administration of this part for purposes of identifying situations in which the provisions of section 1395y(b) of this title may apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Each agreement under this section shall provide that payment shall be issued, mailed, or otherwise transmitted with respect to not less than 95 percent of all claims submitted under this subchapter&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Nomination of agency or organization; withdrawal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the nomination of an agency or organization as provided in this section is made by a group or association of providers of services, it shall not be binding on members of the group or association which notify the Secretary of their election to that effect. Any provider may, upon such notice as may be specified in the agreement under this section with an agency or organization, withdraw its nomination to receive payments through such agency or organization. Any provider which has withdrawn its nomination, and any provider which has not made a nomination, may elect to receive payments from any agency or organization which has entered into an agreement with the Secretary under this section if the Secretary and such agency or organization agree to it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assignment or reassignment of provider of services; designation of agency or organization to perform provider services and home health agency functions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (d) of this section, the Secretary, after taking into consideration any preferences of providers of services, may assign or reassign any provider of services to any agency or organization which has entered into an agreement with him under this section, if he determines, after applying the standards, criteria, and procedures developed under subsection (f) of this section, that such assignment or reassignment would result in the more effective and efficient administration of this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (d) of this section, the Secretary may (subject to the provisions of paragraph (4)) designate a national or regional agency or organization which has entered into an agreement with him under this section to perform functions under the agreement with respect to a class of providers of services in the Nation or region (as the case may be), if he determines, after applying the standards, criteria, and procedures developed under subsection (f) of this section, that such designation would result in more effective and efficient administration of this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Before the Secretary makes an assignment or reassignment under paragraph (1) of a provider of services to other than the agency or organization nominated by the provider, he shall furnish (i) the provider and such agency or organization with a full explanation of the reasons for his determination as to the efficiency and effectiveness of the agency or organization to perform the functions required under this part with respect to the provider, and (ii) such agency or organization with opportunity for a hearing, and such determination shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Before the Secretary makes a designation under paragraph (2) with respect to a class of providers of services, he shall furnish (i) such providers and the agencies and organizations adversely affected by such designation with a full explanation of the reasons for his determination as to the efficiency and effectiveness of such agencies and organizations to perform the functions required under this part with respect to such providers, and (ii) the agencies and organizations adversely affected by such designation with opportunity for a hearing, and such determination shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5.</p>

By not later than July 1, 1987, the Secretary shall limit the number of such regional agencies or organizations to not more than ten.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary shall designate the agency or organization which has entered into an agreement under this section to perform functions under such an agreement with respect to each hospice program, except that with respect to a hospice program which is a subdivision of a provider of services (and such hospice program and provider of services are under common control) due regard shall be given to the agency or organization which performs the functions under this section for the provider of services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Development of standards, criteria, and procedures by Secretary for evaluation of agency or organization performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to determine whether the Secretary should enter into, renew, or terminate an agreement under this section with an agency or organization, whether the Secretary should assign or reassign a provider of services to an agency or organization, and whether the Secretary should designate an agency or organization to perform services with respect to a class of providers of services, the Secretary shall develop standards, criteria, and procedures to evaluate such agency's or organization's (A) overall performance of claims processing (including the agency's or organization's success in recovering payments made under this subchapter for services for which payment has been or could be made under a primary plan (as defined in section 1395y(b)(2)(A) of this title)) and other related functions required to be performed by such an agency or organization under an agreement entered into under this section, and (B) performance of such functions with respect to specific providers of services, and the Secretary shall establish standards and criteria with respect to the efficient and effective administration of this part. No agency or organization shall be found under such standards and criteria not to be efficient or effective or to be less efficient or effective solely on the ground that the agency or organization serves only providers located in a single State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standards and criteria established under paragraph (1) shall include&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Bonding requirement under agreement for officers and employees of agency or organization</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No disbursing officer shall, in the absence of gross negligence or intent to defraud the United States, be liable with respect to any payment by him under this section if it was based upon a voucher signed by a certifying officer designated as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
