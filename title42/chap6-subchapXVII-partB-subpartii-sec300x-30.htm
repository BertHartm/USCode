<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the principal agency of a State for carrying out authorized activities, a funding agreement for a grant under section 300x&ndash;21 of this title for the State for a fiscal year is that such agency will for such year maintain aggregate State expenditures for authorized activities at a level that is not less than the average level of such expenditures maintained by the State for the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which the State is applying for the grant.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon the request of a State, the Secretary may waive all or part of the requirement established in subsection (a) of this section if the Secretary determines that extraordinary economic conditions in the State justify the waiver.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Date certain for acting upon request</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall approve or deny a request for a waiver under paragraph (1) not later than 120 days after the date on which the request is made.</p>

If the Secretary determines that a State has failed to maintain such compliance, the Secretary shall reduce the amount of the allotment under section 300x&ndash;21 of this title for the State for the fiscal year for which the grant is being made by an amount equal to the amount constituting such failure for the previous fiscal year.</p>
