<p class="statutory-body">Before the Secretary prescribes any rule or issues any order imposing a prohibition under this chapter, he shall publish such proposed rule or order in the Federal Register, together with a statement of the reasons for such rule or order and, in the case of a rule, a detailed statement of any special circumstances or characteristics required to be taken into account in prescribing such rule. A copy shall be transmitted to the person who operates any such powerplant required to be specifically identified in such rule or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Petitions for exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any petition for an exemption from any prohibition under this chapter shall be filed at such time and shall be in such form as the Secretary shall by rule prescribe.

Rules required under this paragraph shall be prescribed not later than 120 days after November 9, 1978.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary, upon receipt of such petition, shall notify the appropriate State agencies having primary authority to permit or regulate the construction or operation of the electric powerplant which is the subject of such petition, and, to the maximum extent practicable, consult with such agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary, within 6 months after the period for public comment and hearing applicable to any petition for an exemption, shall issue a final order granting or denying the petition for such exemption, except that the Secretary may extend such period to a specified date if he publishes notice thereof in the Federal Register and includes with such notice a statement of the reasons for such extension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Public comment on prohibitions and exemptions</h4>
