<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The treatment, services, and habitation&nbsp;<sup><a href="#15009_1_target" name="15009_1">1</a></sup> for an individual with developmental disabilities should be designed to maximize the potential of the individual and should be provided in the setting that is least restrictive of the individual's personal liberty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Federal Government and the States both have an obligation to ensure that public funds are provided only to institutional programs, residential programs, and other community programs, including educational programs in which individuals with developmental disabilities participate, that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) provision of care that is free of abuse, neglect, sexual and financial exploitation, and violations of legal and human rights and that subjects individuals with developmental disabilities to no greater risk of harm than others in the general population;</p>
