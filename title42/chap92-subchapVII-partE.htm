<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President, acting through the Secretary and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, shall make a full and complete investigation and study of the alternative national uses of coal available in the United States to meet the Nation's energy requirements consistent with national policies for the protection and enhancement of the quality of the environment and for economic recovery and full employment. In particular the study should identify and evaluate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) current and prospective coal requirements of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) current and prospective voluntary and mandatory energy conservation measures and their potential for reduction of the United States coal requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) current and prospective coal resource production, transportation, conversion, and utilization requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent and adequacy of coal research, development, and demonstration programs being carried out by Federal, State, local, and nongovernmental entities (including financial resources, manpower, and statutory authority);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) programs for the development of coal mining technologies which increase coal production and utilization while protecting the health and safety of coal miners;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) alternative strategies for meeting anticipated United States coal requirements, consistent with achieving other national goals, including national security and environmental protection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) existing and prospective governmental policies and laws affecting the coal industry with the view of determining what, if any, changes in and implementation of such policies and laws may be advisable in order to consolidate, coordinate, and provide an effective and equitable national energy policy consistent with other national policies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the most efficient use of the Nation's coal resources considering economic (including capital and consumer costs, and balance of payments), social (including employment), environmental, technological, national defense, and other aspects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 18 months after the effective date of this chapter, the President shall submit to the Congress a report with respect to the studies and investigations, together with findings and recommendations in order that the Congress may have such information in a timely fashion. Such report shall include the President's determinations and recommendations with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Nation's projected coal needs nationally and regionally, for the next 2 decades with particular reference to electric power;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the coal resources available or which must be developed to meet those needs, including, as applicable, the programs for research, development, and demonstration necessary to provide technological advances which may greatly enhance the Nation's ability to efficiently and economically utilize its fuel resources, consistent with applicable environmental requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the air, water, and other pollution created by coal requirements, including any programs to overcome promptly and efficiently any technological or economic barriers to the elimination of such pollution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the existing policies and programs of the Federal Government and of State and local governments, which have any significant impact on the availability, production or efficient and economic utilization of coal resources and on the ability to meet the Nation's energy needs and environmental requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the adequacy of various transportation systems, including roads, railroads, and waterways to meet projected increases in coal production and utilization.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before submitting a report to the Congress under subsection (b) of this section, the President shall publish in the Federal Register a notice and summary of the proposed report, make copies of such report available, and accord interested persons an opportunity (of not less than 90 days&rsquo; duration) to present written comments; and shall make such modifications of such report as he may consider appropriate on the basis of such comments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary for allocation between the Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency for fiscal years 1979 and 1980, not to exceed $18,000,000, for use in carrying out the purposes of this section.</p>
