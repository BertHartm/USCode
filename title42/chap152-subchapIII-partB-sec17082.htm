<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Consortium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;consortium&rdquo; means a High-Performance Green Building Consortium selected by the Commercial Director.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Initiative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;initiative&rdquo; means the Zero-Net-Energy Commercial Buildings Initiative established under subsection (b)(1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Zero-net-energy commercial building</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;zero-net-energy commercial building&rdquo; means a high-performance commercial building that is designed, constructed, and operated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to require a greatly reduced quantity of energy to operate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to meet the balance of energy needs from sources of energy that do not produce greenhouse gases;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in a manner that will result in no net emissions of greenhouse gases; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to be economically viable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commercial Director shall establish an initiative, to be known as the &ldquo;Zero-Net-Energy Commercial Buildings Initiative&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to reduce the quantity of energy consumed by commercial buildings located in the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to achieve the development of zero net energy commercial buildings in the United States.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8027 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consortium</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 180 days after December 19, 2007, the Commercial Director shall competitively select, and enter into an agreement with, a consortium to develop and carry out the initiative.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In entering into an agreement with a consortium under subparagraph (A), the Commercial Director shall use the authority described in section 7256(g) of this title, to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Goal of initiative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The goal of the initiative shall be to develop and disseminate technologies, practices, and policies for the development and establishment of zero net energy commercial buildings for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any commercial building newly constructed in the United States by 2030;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 50 percent of the commercial building stock of the United States by 2040; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) all commercial buildings in the United States by 2050.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Components</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the initiative, the Commercial Director, in consultation with the consortium, may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) conduct research and development on building science, design, materials, components, equipment and controls, operation and other practices, integration, energy use measurement, and benchmarking;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) conduct pilot programs and demonstration projects to evaluate replicable approaches to achieving energy efficient commercial buildings for a variety of building types in a variety of climate zones;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) conduct deployment, dissemination, and technical assistance activities to encourage widespread adoption of technologies, practices, and policies to achieve energy efficient commercial buildings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) conduct other research, development, demonstration, and deployment activities necessary to achieve each goal of the initiative, as determined by the Commercial Director, in consultation with the consortium;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) develop training materials and courses for building professionals and trades on achieving cost-effective high-performance energy efficient buildings;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) support code-setting organizations and State and local governments in developing minimum performance standards in building codes that recognize the ready availability of many technologies utilized in high-performance energy efficient buildings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) develop strategies for overcoming the split incentives between builders and purchasers, and landlords and tenants, to ensure that energy efficiency and high-performance investments are made that are cost-effective on a lifecycle basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) develop improved means of measurement and verification of energy savings and performance for public dissemination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Cost sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out this section, the Commercial Director shall require cost sharing in accordance with section 16352 of this title.</p>
