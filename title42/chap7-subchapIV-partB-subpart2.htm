<h3 class="section-head">&sect;629. Findings and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that there is a continuing urgent need to protect children and to strengthen families as demonstrated by the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Family support programs directed at specific vulnerable populations have had positive effects on parents, children, or both. The vulnerable populations for which programs have been shown to be effective include teenage mothers with very young children and families that have children with special needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Family preservation programs have been shown to provide extensive and intensive services to families in crisis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The time lines established by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 have made the prompt availability of services to address family problems (and in particular the prompt availability of appropriate services and treatment addressing substance abuse) an important factor in successful family reunification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The rapid increases in the annual number of adoptions since the enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 have created a growing need for postadoption services and for service providers with the particular knowledge and skills required to address the unique issues adoptive families and children may face.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this program is to enable States to develop and establish, or expand, and to operate coordinated programs of community-based family support services, family preservation services, time-limited family reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services to accomplish the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To prevent child maltreatment among families at risk through the provision of supportive family services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To assure children's safety within the home and preserve intact families in which children have been maltreated, when the family's problems can be addressed effectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To address the problems of families whose children have been placed in foster care so that reunification may occur in a safe and stable manner in accordance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To support adoptive families by providing support services as necessary so that they can make a lifetime commitment to their children.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;629i. Grants for programs for mentoring children of prisoners</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the period between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a parent incarcerated in a Federal or State correctional facility increased by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to approximately 2,000,000. In 1999, 2.1 percent of all children in the United States had a parent in Federal or State prison.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Prior to incarceration, 64 percent of female prisoners and 44 percent of male prisoners in State facilities lived with their children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Nearly 90 percent of the children of incarcerated fathers live with their mothers, and 79 percent of the children of incarcerated mothers live with a grandparent or other relative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Parental arrest and confinement lead to stress, trauma, stigmatization, and separation problems for children. These problems are coupled with existing problems that include poverty, violence, parental substance abuse, high-crime environments, intrafamilial abuse, child abuse and neglect, multiple care givers, and/or prior separations. As a result, these children often exhibit a broad variety of behavioral, emotional, health, and educational problems that are often compounded by the pain of separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Empirical research demonstrates that mentoring is a potent force for improving children's behavior across all risk behaviors affecting health. Quality, one-on-one relationships that provide young people with caring role models for future success have profound, life-changing potential. Done right, mentoring markedly advances youths&rsquo; life prospects. A widely cited 1995 study by Public/Private Ventures measured the impact of one Big Brothers Big Sisters program and found significant effects in the lives of youth&mdash;cutting first-time drug use by almost half and first-time alcohol use by about a third, reducing school absenteeism by half, cutting assaultive behavior by a third, improving parental and peer relationships, giving youth greater confidence in their school work, and improving academic performance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is to authorize the Secretary to make competitive grants to applicants in areas with substantial numbers of children of incarcerated parents, to support the establishment or expansion and operation of programs using a network of public and private community entities to provide mentoring services for children of prisoners.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Children of prisoners</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;children of prisoners&rdquo; means children one or both of whose parents are incarcerated in a Federal, State, or local correctional facility. The term is deemed to include children who are in an ongoing mentoring relationship in a program under this section at the time of their parents&rsquo; release from prison, for purposes of continued participation in the program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mentoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;mentoring&rdquo; means a structured, managed program in which children are appro<!-- PDFPage:1539 -->priately matched with screened and trained adult volunteers for one-on-one relationships, involving meetings and activities on a regular basis, intended to meet, in part, the child's need for involvement with a caring and supportive adult who provides a positive role model.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Mentoring services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;mentoring services&rdquo; means those services and activities that support a structured, managed program of mentoring, including the management by trained personnel of outreach to, and screening of, eligible children; outreach to, education and training of, and liaison with sponsoring local organizations; screening and training of adult volunteers; matching of children with suitable adult volunteer mentors; support and oversight of the mentoring relationship; and establishment of goals and evaluation of outcomes for mentored children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">From the amounts appropriated under subsection (h) of this section for a fiscal year that remain after applying subsection (h)(2) of this section, the Secretary shall make grants under this section for each of fiscal years 2002 through 2006 to State or local governments, tribal governments or tribal consortia, faith-based organizations, and community-based organizations in areas that have significant numbers of children of prisoners and that submit applications meeting the requirements of this section, in amounts that do not exceed $5,000,000 per grant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Application requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to be eligible for a grant under this section, the chief executive officer of the applicant must submit to the Secretary an application containing the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Program design</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A description of the proposed program, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the number of mentor-child matches proposed to be established and maintained annually under the program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) such information as the Secretary may require concerning the methods to be used to recruit, screen support, and oversee individuals participating as mentors, (which methods shall include criminal background checks on the individuals), and to evaluate outcomes for participating children, including information necessary to demonstrate compliance with requirements established by the Secretary for the program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) such other information as the Secretary may require.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Community consultation; coordination with other programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A demonstration that, in developing and implementing the program, the applicant will, to the extent feasible and appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) consult with public and private community entities, including religious organizations, and including, as appropriate, Indian tribal organizations and urban Indian organizations, and with family members of potential clients;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) coordinate the programs and activities under the program with other Federal, State, and local programs serving children and youth; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consult with appropriate Federal, State, and local corrections, workforce development, and substance abuse and mental health agencies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Equal access for local service providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An assurance that public and private entities and community organizations, including religious organizations and Indian organizations, will be eligible to participate on an equal basis.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Federal share</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A grant for a program under this section shall be available to pay a percentage share of the costs of the program up to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 75 percent for the first and second fiscal years for which the grant is awarded; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 50 percent for the third and each succeeding such fiscal years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Non-Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The non-Federal share of the cost of projects under this section may be in cash or in kind. In determining the amount of the non-Federal share, the Secretary may attribute fair market value to goods, services, and facilities contributed from non-Federal sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Considerations in awarding grants</h4>
