<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">To the extent the Secretary determines that the requirement of this subparagraph would be inappropriate to apply to a regional partnership that includes an Indian tribe, tribal consortium, or a tribal child welfare agency or a consortium of such agencies, the Secretary may exempt the regional partnership from the requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Such other information as the Secretary may require.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) after taking such factors into consideration, give greater weight to awarding grants to regional partnerships that propose to address methamphetamine abuse and addiction in the partnership region (alone or in combination with other drug abuse and addiction) and which demonstrate that methamphetamine abuse and addiction (alone or in combination with other drug abuse and addiction) is adversely affecting child welfare in the partnership region.</p>

The report shall contain such information as the Secretary determines is necessary to provide an accurate description of the services provided or activities conducted with such funds.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;629i. Grants for programs for mentoring children of prisoners</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and purposes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the period between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a parent incarcerated in a Federal or State correctional facility increased by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to approximately 2,000,000. In 1999, 2.1 percent of all children in the United States had a parent in Federal or State prison.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Prior to incarceration, 64 percent of female prisoners and 44 percent of male prisoners in State facilities lived with their children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Nearly 90 percent of the children of incarcerated fathers live with their mothers, and 79 percent of the children of incarcerated mothers live with a grandparent or other relative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Parental arrest and confinement lead to stress, trauma, stigmatization, and separation problems for children. These problems are coupled with existing problems that include poverty, violence, parental substance abuse, high-crime environments, intrafamilial abuse, child abuse and neglect, multiple care givers, and/or prior separations. As a result, these children often exhibit a broad variety of behavioral, emotional, health, and educational problems that are often compounded by the pain of separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Empirical research demonstrates that mentoring is a potent force for improving children's behavior across all risk behaviors affecting health. Quality, one-on-one relationships that provide young people with caring role models for future success have profound, life-changing potential. Done right, mentoring markedly advances youths&rsquo; life prospects. A widely cited 1995 study by Public/Private Ventures measured the impact of one Big Brothers Big Sisters program and found significant effects in the lives of youth&mdash;cutting first-time drug use by almost half and first-time alcohol use by about a third, reducing school absenteeism by half, cutting assaultive behavior by a third, improving parental and peer relationships, giving youth greater confidence in their school work, and improving academic performance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purposes of this section are to authorize the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to make competitive grants to applicants in areas with substantial numbers of children of incarcerated parents, to support the establishment or expansion and operation of programs using a network of public and private community entities to provide mentoring services for children of prisoners; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to enter into on a competitive basis a cooperative agreement to conduct a service delivery demonstration project in accordance with the requirements of subsection (g).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Mentoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;mentoring&rdquo; means a structured, managed program in which children are appropriately matched with screened and trained adult volunteers for one-on-one relationships, involving meetings and activities on a regular basis, intended to meet, in part, the child's need for involvement with a caring and supportive adult who provides a positive role model.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Mentoring services</h4>
