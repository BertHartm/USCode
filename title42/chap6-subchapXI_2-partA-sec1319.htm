<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the State agency or local agency administering the plan approved under such subchapter has made a finding (prior to making such expenditure) that (A) such home is so defective that continued occupancy is unwarranted, (B) unless repairs are made to such home, rental quarters will be necessary for such individual, and (C) the cost of rental quarters to take care of the needs of such individual (including his spouse living with him in such home and any other individual whose needs were taken into account in determining the need of such individual) would exceed (over such time as the Secretary may specify) the cost of repairs needed to make such home habitable together with other costs attributable to continued occupancy of such home, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no such expenditures were made for repairing such home pursuant to any prior finding under this section,</p>
