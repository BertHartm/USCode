<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Definition of GIS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;GIS&rdquo; means geographic information systems technology that facilitates the organization and management of data with a geographic component.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a program of research, development, demonstration, and commercial application to maximize the productive capacity of marginal wells and reservoirs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Data collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the program, the Secretary shall collect data on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the status and location of marginal wells and oil and gas reservoirs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the production capacity of marginal wells and oil and gas reservoirs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the location of low-pressure gathering facilities and pipelines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the quantity of natural gas vented or flared in association with crude oil production.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Analysis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the program, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) estimate the remaining producible reserves based on variable pipeline pressures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) recommend measures that will enable the continued production of those resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Study</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may award a grant to an organization of States that contain significant numbers of marginal oil and natural gas wells to conduct an annual study of low-volume natural gas reservoirs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Organization with no GIS capabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an organization receiving a grant under paragraph (1) does not have GIS capabilities, the organization shall contract with an institution of higher education with GIS capabilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) State geologists</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The organization receiving a grant under paragraph (1) shall collaborate with the State geologist of each State being studied.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Public information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may use the data collected and analyzed under this section to produce maps and literature to disseminate to States to promote conservation of natural gas reserves.</p>
