<!-- PDFPage:7907 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Research</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;research&rdquo; includes research on the technologies, materials, and manufacturing processes required for white light emitting diodes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) White light emitting diode</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;white light emitting diode&rdquo; means a semiconducting package, using either organic or inorganic materials, that produces white light using externally applied voltage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Initiative</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall carry out a Next Generation Lighting Initiative in accordance with this section to support research, development, demonstration, and commercial application activities related to advanced solid-state lighting technologies based on white light emitting diodes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The objectives of the Initiative shall be to develop advanced solid-state organic and inorganic lighting technologies based on white light emitting diodes that, compared to incandescent and fluorescent lighting technologies, are longer lasting, are more energy-efficient and cost-competitive, and have less environmental impact.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Industry Alliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 90 days after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall competitively select an Industry Alliance to represent participants who are private, for-profit firms, open to large and small businesses, that, as a group, are broadly representative of United States solid-state lighting research, development, infrastructure, and manufacturing expertise as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Research</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall carry out the research activities of the Initiative through competitively awarded grants to&mdash;</p>
