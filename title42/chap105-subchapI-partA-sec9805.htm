<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this part is to establish special programs of assistance to nonprofit private locally initiated community development corporations which (1) are directed to the solution of the critical problems existing in particular communities or neighborhoods (defined without regard to political or other subdivisions or boundaries) within those urban and rural areas having concentrations or substantial numbers of low-income persons; (2) are of sufficient size, scope, and duration to have an appreciable impact in such communities, neighborhoods, and rural areas in arresting tendencies toward dependency, chronic unemployment, and community deterioration; (3) hold forth the prospect of continuing to have such impact after the termination of financial assistance under this part; and (4) provide financial and other assistance to start, expand, or locate enterprises in or near the area to be served so as to provide employment and ownership opportunities for residents of such areas, including those who are disadvantaged in the labor market because of their limited speaking, reading, and writing abilities in the English language.</p>
