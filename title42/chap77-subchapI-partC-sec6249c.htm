<p class="statutory-body">Subsections (e) through (h) of this section are enacted by the Congress&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate, and as such they are deemed a part of the rules of the Senate but applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed in the Senate in the case of implementing bills and implementing revenue bills described in subsection (a) of this section, and they supersede other rules only to the extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5389 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of the Senate to change the rules (so far as relating to the procedure of the Senate) at any time, in the same manner and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of the Senate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) No motion to suspend the application of this subsection shall be in order in the Senate; nor shall it be in order in the Senate for the Presiding Officer to entertain a request to suspend the application of this subsection by unanimous consent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Discharge in Senate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (3), if the committee or committees of the Senate to which an implementing bill has been referred have not reported it at the close of the 30th day after its introduction, such committee or committees shall be automatically discharged from further consideration of the bill, and it shall be placed on the appropriate calendar.</p>

If such committee or committees have not reported such bill at the close of the 15th day after its receipt by the Senate, such committee or committees shall be automatically discharged from further consideration of such bill and it shall be placed on the calendar. A vote on final passage of such bill shall be taken in the Senate on or before the close of the 15th day after such bill is reported by the committee or committees of the Senate to which it was referred, or after such committee or committees have been discharged from further consideration of such bill.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) A motion in the Senate to further limit debate is not debatable. A motion to recommit an implementing bill is not in order.</p>
