<p class="statutory-body">(b) The term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; means money payments with respect to a dependent child or dependent children, or, at the option of the State, a pregnant woman but only if it has been medically verified that the child is expected to be born in the month such payments are made or within the three-month period following such month of payment, and who, if such child had been born and was liv<!-- PDFPage:1210 -->ing with her in the month of payment, would be eligible for aid to families with dependent children, and includes (1) money payments to meet the needs of the relative with whom any dependent child is living (and the spouse of such relative if living with him and if such relative is the child's parent and the child is a dependent child by reason of the physical or mental incapacity of a parent or is a dependent child under section 607 of this title), and (2) payments with respect to any dependent child (including payments to meet the needs of the relative, and the relative's spouse, with whom such child is living, and the needs of any other individual living in the same home if such needs are taken into account in making the determination under section 602(a)(7) of this title) which do not meet the preceding requirements of this subsection, but which would meet such requirements except that such payments are made to another individual who (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such child or relative, or are made on behalf of such child or relative directly to a person furnishing food, living accommodations, or other goods, services, or items to or for such child, relative, or other individual, but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 602 of this title includes provision for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determination by the State agency that the relative of the child with respect to whom such payments are made has such inability to manage funds that making payments to him would be contrary to the welfare of the child and, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid with respect to such child and relative through payments described in this clause (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) undertaking and continuing special efforts to develop greater ability on the part of the relative to manage funds in such manner as to protect the welfare of the family;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) periodic review by such State agency of the determination under clause (A) to ascertain whether conditions justifying such determination still exist, with provision for termination of such payments if they do not and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative, as described in section 1311 of this title, if and when it appears that the need for such payments is continuing, or is likely to continue, beyond a period specified by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on the determination referred to in clause (A) for any individual with respect to whom it is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments with respect to a dependent child which are intended to enable the recipient to pay for specific goods, services, or items recognized by the State agency as a part of the child's need under the State plan may (in the discretion of the State or local agency administering the plan in the political subdivision) be made, pursuant to a determination referred to in clause (2)(A), in the form of checks drawn jointly to the order of the recipient and the person furnishing such goods, services, or items and negotiable only upon endorsement by both such recipient and such person; and payments so made shall be considered for all of the purposes of this part to be payments described in clause (2). Whenever payments with respect to a dependent child are made in the manner described in clause (2) (including payments described in the preceding sentence), a statement of the specific reasons for making such payments in that manner (on which the determination under clause (2)(A) was based) shall be placed in the file maintained with respect to such child by the State or local agency administering the State plan in the political subdivision. Payments of the type described in clause (2) shall not be subject to the requirements of clauses (A) through (D) of such clause (2), when they are made in the manner described in clause (2) at the request of the family member to whom payment would otherwise be made in an unrestricted manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The term &ldquo;relative with whom any dependent child is living&rdquo; means the individual who is one of the relatives specified in subsection (a) of this section and with whom such child is living (within the meaning of such subsection) in a place of residence maintained by such individual (himself or together with any one or more of the other relatives so specified) as his (or their) own home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Repealed. Pub. L. 93&ndash;647, &sect;3(a)(5), Jan. 4, 1975, 88 Stat. 2348.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The term &ldquo;emergency assistance to needy families with children&rdquo; means any of the following, furnished for a period not in excess of 30 days in any 12-month period, in the case of a needy child under the age of 21 who is (or, within such period as may be specified by the Secretary, has been) living with any of the relatives specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home, but only where such child is without available resources, the payments, care, or services involved are necessary to avoid destitution of such child or to provide living arrangements in a home for such child, and such destitution or need for living arrangements did not arise because such child or relative refused without good cause to accept employment or training for employment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) money payments, payments in kind, or such other payments as the State agency may specify with respect to, or medical care or any other type of remedial care recognized under State law (for which such individual is not entitled to medical assistance under the State plan under subchapter XIX of this chapter) on behalf of, such child or any other member of the household in which he is living, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such services as may be specified by the Secretary;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; does not mean payments with respect to a parent (or other individual whose needs such State determines <!-- PDFPage:1211 -->should be considered in determining the need of the child or relative claiming aid under the plan of such State approved under this part) of a child who fails to cooperate with any agency or official of the State in obtaining such support payments for such child. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to make an otherwise eligible child ineligible for protective payments because of the failure of such parent (or such other individual) to so cooperate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; does not mean any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amount paid to meet the needs of an unborn child; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) amount paid (or by which a payment is increased) to meet the needs of a woman occasioned by or resulting from her pregnancy, unless, as has been medically verified, the woman's child is expected to be born in the month such payments are made (or increased) or within the three-month period following such month of payment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Each dependent child, and each relative with whom such a child is living (including the spouse of such relative as described in subsection (b) of this section), who becomes ineligible for aid to families with dependent children as a result (wholly or partly) of the collection or increased collection of child or spousal support under part D of this subchapter, and who has received such aid in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which such ineligibility begins, shall be deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children for purposes of subchapter XIX of this chapter for an additional four calendar months beginning with the month in which such ineligibility begins.</p>
