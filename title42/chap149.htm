The amount of such payment made to any such owner or operator shall be as determined under subsection (e) of this section. Payments under this section may only be made upon receipt by the Secretary of an incentive payment application which establishes that the applicant is eligible to receive such payment and which satisfies such other requirements as the Secretary deems necessary. Such application shall be in such form, and shall be submitted at such time, as the Secretary shall establish.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definitions</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amount of payment</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payments made by the Secretary under this section to the owner or operator of a qualified hydroelectric facility shall be based on the number of kilowatt hours of hydroelectric energy generated by the facility during the incentive period.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the request of an electric utility located in an insular area that commits to fund at least 10 percent of the cost of the study; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the electric utility is located in the Federated States of Micronesia, the Repub<!-- PDFPage:6987 -->lic of the Marshall Islands, or the Republic of Palau, written support for that request by the President or the Ambassador of the affected freely associated state.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall consult with regional utility organizations in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) conducting feasibility studies under paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) determining the feasibility of potential projects.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Feasibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For the purpose of a feasibility study under paragraph (1), a project shall be determined to be feasible if the project would significantly reduce the dependence of an insular area on imported fossil fuels, or provide needed distributed generation to an insular area, at a reasonable cost.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Implementation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On a determination by the Secretary (in consultation with the Secretary of the Interior) that a project is feasible under subsection (a) and a commitment by an electric utility to operate and maintain the project, the Secretary may provide such technical and financial assistance as the Secretary determines is appropriate for the implementation of the project.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regional utility organizations</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall consult annually with any State from which Federal oil or gas royalty is being taken in-kind to ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that the royalty in-kind program provides revenues to the State greater than or equal to the revenues likely to have been received had royalties been taken in-value.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Small refineries</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Preference</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the property no longer qualifies as a marginal property.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations prescribing different relief</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Discretionary regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may by regulation prescribe different parameters, standards, and require<!-- PDFPage:6990 -->ments for, and a different degree or extent of, royalty relief for marginal properties in lieu of those prescribed in subsections (a) through (d).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it serves the national interest to increase petroleum refining capacity for gasoline, heating oil, diesel fuel, jet fuel, kerosene, and petrochemical feedstocks wherever located within the United States, to bring more supply to the markets for the use of the American people;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) United States demand for refined petroleum products currently exceeds the country's petroleum refining capacity to produce such products;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) this excess demand has been met with increased imports;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) due to lack of capacity, refined petroleum product imports are expected to grow from 7.9 percent to 10.7 percent of total refined product by 2025;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) refiners are still subject to significant environmental and other regulations and face several new requirements under the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.) over the next decade; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) better coordination of Federal and State regulatory reviews may help facilitate siting and construction of new refineries to meet the demand in the United States for refined products.</p>
