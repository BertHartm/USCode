<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Organization as secondary payer</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such determination shall not apply to contracts under this part until the first contract year that begins after the end of such period, and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Medicare+Choice organization shall not discriminate with respect to participation, reimbursement, or indemnification as to any provider who is acting within the scope of the provider's license or certification under applicable State law, solely on the basis of such license or certification.
