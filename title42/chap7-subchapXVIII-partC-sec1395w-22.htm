<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in section 1395w&ndash;28(b)(3) of this title for MSA plans and except as provided in paragraph (6) for MA regional plans, each Medicare+Choice plan shall provide to members enrolled under this part, through providers and other persons that meet the applicable requirements of this subchapter and part A of subchapter XI of this chapter, benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option (and, for plan years before 2006, additional benefits required under section 1395w&ndash;24(f)(1)(A) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option defined</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this part, the term &ldquo;benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option&rdquo; means those items and services (other than hospice care) for which benefits are available under parts A and B to individuals entitled to benefits under part A and enrolled under part B, with cost-sharing for those services as required under parts A and B or, subject to clause (iii), an actuarially equivalent level of cost-sharing as determined in this part.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Special rule for regional plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of an MA regional plan in determining an actuarially equivalent level of cost-sharing with respect to benefits under the original medicare fee-for-service program option, there shall only be taken into account, with respect to the application of section 1395w&ndash;27a(b)(2) of this title, such expenses only with respect to subparagraph (A) of such section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2717 --><h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Limitation on variation of cost sharing for certain benefits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of services described in clause (iv) for which there is no cost-sharing required under parts A and B, cost-sharing may be required for those services in accordance with clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Satisfaction of requirement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A Medicare+Choice plan (other than an MSA plan) offered by a Medicare+Choice organization satisfies paragraph (1)(A), with respect to benefits for items and services furnished other than through a provider or other person that has a contract with the organization offering the plan, if the plan provides payment in an amount so that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sum of such payment amount and any cost sharing provided for under the plan, is equal to at least</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total dollar amount of payment for such items and services as would otherwise be authorized under parts A and B of this subchapter (including any balance billing permitted under such parts).</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Election of uniform coverage determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a Medicare+Choice organization that offers a Medicare+Choice plan in an area in which more than one local coverage determination is applied with respect to different parts of the area, the organization may elect to have the local coverage determination for the part of the area that is most beneficial to Medicare+Choice enrollees (as identified by the Secretary) apply with respect to all Medicare+Choice enrollees enrolled in the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Supplemental benefits</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Benefits included subject to Secretary's approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each Medicare+Choice organization may provide to individuals enrolled under this part, other than under an MSA plan (without affording those individuals an option to decline the coverage), supplemental health care benefits that the Secretary may approve. The Secretary shall approve any such supplemental benefits unless the Secretary determines that including such supplemental benefits would substantially discourage enrollment by Medicare+Choice eligible individuals with the organization.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) At enrollees&rsquo; option</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), a Medicare+Choice organization may provide to individuals enrolled under this part supplemental health care benefits that the individuals may elect, at their option, to have covered.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Special rule for MSA plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A Medicare+Choice organization may not provide, under an MSA plan, supplemental health care benefits that cover the deductible described in section 1395w&ndash;28(b)(2)(B) of this title. In applying the previous sentence, health benefits described in section 1395ss(u)(2)(B) of this title shall not be treated as covering such deductible.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Application to Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as preventing a Medicare+Choice private fee-for-service plan from offering supplemental benefits that include payment for some or all of the balance billing amounts permitted consistent with subsection (k) of this section and coverage of additional services that the plan finds to be medically necessary. Such benefits may include reductions in cost-sharing below the actuarial value specified in section 1395w&ndash;24(e)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Organization as secondary payer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a Medicare+Choice organization may (in the case of the provision of items and services to an individual under a Medicare+Choice plan under circumstances in which payment under this subchapter is made secondary pursuant to section 1395y(b)(2) of this title) charge or authorize the provider of such services to charge, in accordance with the charges allowed under a law, plan, or policy described in such section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the insurance carrier, employer, or other entity which under such law, plan, or policy is to pay for the provision of such services, or</p>

<!-- PDFPage:2718 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) National coverage determinations and legislative changes in benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If there is a national coverage determination or legislative change in benefits required to be provided under this part made in the period beginning on the date of an announcement under section 1395w&ndash;23(b) of this title and ending on the date of the next announcement under such section and the Secretary projects that the determination will result in a significant change in the costs to a Medicare+Choice organization of providing the benefits that are the subject of such national coverage determination and that such change in costs was not incorporated in the determination of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate under section 1395w&ndash;23 of this title included in the announcement made at the beginning of such period, then, unless otherwise required by law&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such determination or legislative change in benefits shall not apply to contracts under this part until the first contract year that begins after the end of such period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if such coverage determination or legislative change provides for coverage of additional benefits or coverage under additional circumstances, section 1395w&ndash;21(i)(1) of this title shall not apply to payment for such additional benefits or benefits provided under such additional circumstances until the first contract year that begins after the end of such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The projection under the previous sentence shall be based on an analysis by the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services of the actuarial costs associated with the coverage determination or legislative change in benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Special benefit rules for regional plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an MA plan that is an MA regional plan, benefits under the plan shall include the benefits described in paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 1395w&ndash;27a(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation on cost-sharing for dual eligibles and qualified medicare beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an individual who is a full-benefit dual eligible individual (as defined in section 1396u&ndash;5(c)(6) of this title) or a qualified medicare beneficiary (as defined in section 1396d(p)(1) of this title) and who is enrolled in a specialized Medicare Advantage plan for special needs individuals described in section 1395w&ndash;28(b)(6)(B)(ii) of this title, the plan may not impose cost-sharing that exceeds the amount of cost-sharing that would be permitted with respect to the individual under subchapter XIX if the individual were not enrolled in such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Antidiscrimination</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Beneficiaries</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
