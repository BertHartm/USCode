<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement of requests and certifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (d) and (g) of this section and in section 1395mm of this title, payment for services furnished an individual may be made only to providers of services which are eligible therefor under section 1395cc of this title and only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) written request, signed by such individual, except in cases in which the Secretary finds it impracticable for the individual to do so, is filed for such payment in such form, in such manner, and by such person or persons as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, no later than the close of the period of 3 calendar years following the year in which such services are furnished (deeming any services furnished in the last 3 calendar months of any calendar year to have been furnished in the succeeding calendar year) except that where the Secretary deems that efficient administration so requires, such period may be reduced to not less than 1 calendar year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a physician, or, in the case of services described in subparagraph (B), a physician, or a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist who does not have a direct or indirect employment relationship with the facility but is working in collaboration with a physician, certifies (and recertifies, where such services are furnished over a period of time, in such cases, with such frequency, and accompanied by such supporting material, appropriate to the case involved, as may be provided by regulations, except that the first of such recertifications shall be required in each case of inpatient hospital services not later than the 20th day of such period) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of inpatient psychiatric hospital services, such services are or were required to be given on an inpatient basis, by or under the supervision of a physician, for the psychiatric treatment of an individual; and (i) such treatment can or could reasonably be expected to improve the condition for which such treatment is or was necessary or (ii) inpatient diagnostic study is or was medically required and such services are or were necessary for such purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of post-hospital extended care services, such services are or were required to be given because the individual needs or needed on a daily basis skilled nursing care (provided directly by or requiring the supervision of skilled nursing personnel) or other skilled rehabilitation services, which as a practical matter can only be provided in a skilled nursing facility on an inpatient basis, for any of the conditions with respect to which he was receiving inpatient hospital services (or services which would constitute inpatient hospital services if the institution met the requirements of paragraphs (6) and (9) of section 1395x(e) of this title) prior to transfer to the skilled nursing facility or for a condition requiring such extended care services which arose after such transfer and while he was still in the facility for treatment of the condition or conditions for which he was receiving such inpatient hospital services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in the case of home health services, such services are or were required because the individual is or was confined to his home (except when receiving items and services referred to in section 1395x(m)(7) of this title) and needs or needed skilled nursing care (other than solely venipuncture for the purpose of obtaining a blood sample) on an intermittent basis or physical or speech therapy or, in the case of an individual who has been furnished home health services based on such a need and who no longer has such a need for such care or therapy, continues or continued to need occupational therapy; a plan for furnishing such services to such individual has been established and is periodically reviewed by a physician; and such services are or were furnished while the individual was under the care of a physician; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of inpatient hospital services in connection with the care, treatment, filling, removal, or replacement of teeth or structures directly supporting teeth, the individual, because of his underlying medical condition and clinical status or because of the severity of the dental procedure, requires hospitalization in connection with the provision of such services;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) with respect to inpatient hospital services (other than inpatient psychiatric hospital services) which are furnished over a period of time, a physician certifies that such services are required to be given on an inpatient basis for such individual's medical treatment, or that inpatient diagnostic study is medically required and such services are necessary for such purpose, except that (A) such certification shall be furnished only in such cases, with such frequency, and accompanied by such supporting material, appropriate to the cases involved, as may be provided by regulations, and (B) the first such certification required in accordance with clause (A) shall be furnished no later than the 20th day of such period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of inpatient psychiatric hospital services, the services are those which the records of the hospital indicate were furnished to the individual during periods when he was receiving (A) intensive treatment services, (B) admission and related services necessary for a diagnostic study, or (C) equivalent services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) with respect to inpatient hospital services furnished such individual after the 20th day of a continuous period of such services, there was not in effect, at the time of admission of such individual to the hospital, a decision under section 1395cc(d) of this title (based on a finding that utilization review of long-stay cases is not being made in such hospital);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) with respect to inpatient hospital services or post-hospital extended care services furnished such individual during a continuous period, a finding has not been made (by the physician members of the committee or group, as described in section 1395x(k)(4) of this title, including any finding made in the course of a sample or other review of admissions to the institution) pursuant to the system of utiliza<!-- PDFPage:1734 -->tion review that further inpatient hospital services or further post-hospital extended care services, as the case may be, are not medically necessary; except that, if such a finding has been made, payment may be made for such services furnished before the 4th day after the day on which the hospital or skilled nursing facility, as the case may be, received notice of such finding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) in the case of hospice care provided an individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) in the first 90-day period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the individual's attending physician (as defined in section 1395x(dd)(3)(B) of this title), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the medical director (or physician member of the interdisciplinary group described in section 1395x(dd)(2)(B) of this title) of the hospice program providing (or arranging for) the care,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">each certify in writing at the beginning of the period, that the individual is terminally ill (as defined in section 1395x(dd)(3)(A) of this title), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in a subsequent 90- or 60-day period, the medical director or physician described in clause (i)(II) recertifies at the beginning of the period that the individual is terminally ill.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a written plan for providing hospice care with respect to such individual has been established (before such care is provided by, or under arrangements made by, that hospice program) and is periodically reviewed by the individual's attending physician and by the medical director (and the interdisciplinary group described in section 1395x(dd)(2)(B) of this title) of the hospice program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) such care is being or was provided pursuant to such plan of care; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in the case of inpatient critical access hospital services, a physician certifies that the individual may reasonably be expected to be discharged or transferred to a hospital within 96 hours after admission to the critical access hospital.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent provided by regulations, the certification and recertification requirements of paragraph (2) shall be deemed satisfied where, at a later date, a physician, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse specialist (as the case may be) makes certification of the kind provided in subparagraph (A), (B), (C), or (D) of paragraph (2) (whichever would have applied), but only where such certification is accompanied by such medical and other evidence as may be required by such regulations. With respect to the physician certification required by paragraph (2) for home health services furnished to any individual by a home health agency (other than an agency which is a governmental entity) and with respect to the establishment and review of a plan for such services, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which shall become effective no later than July 1, 1981, and which prohibit a physician who has a significant ownership interest in, or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, such home health agency from performing such certification and from establishing or reviewing such plan, except that such prohibition shall not apply with respect to a home health agency which is a sole community home health agency (as determined by the Secretary). For purposes of the preceding sentence, service by a physician as an uncompensated officer or director of a home health agency shall not constitute having a significant ownership interest in, or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, such agency. For purposes of paragraph (2)(C), an individual shall be considered to be &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo; if the individual has a condition, due to an illness or injury, that restricts the ability of the individual to leave his or her home except with the assistance of another individual or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker), or if the individual has a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated. While an individual does not have to be bedridden to be considered &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo;, the condition of the individual should be such that there exists a normal inability to leave home, that leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort by the individual, and that absences of the individual from home are infrequent or of relatively short duration, or are attributable to the need to receive medical treatment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount paid to provider of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount paid to any provider of services (other than a hospice program providing hospice care, other than a critical access hospital providing inpatient critical access hospital services, and other than a home health agency with respect to durable medical equipment) with respect to services for which payment may be made under this part shall, subject to the provisions of sections 1395e&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395f_1_target" name="1395f_1">1</a></sup> 1395ww, and 1395fff of this title, be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) except as provided in paragraph (3), the lesser of (A) the reasonable cost of such services, as determined under section 1395x(v) of this title and as further limited by section 1395rr(b)(2)(B) of this title, or (B) the customary charges with respect to such services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such services are furnished by a public provider of services, or by another provider which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that a significant portion of its patients are low-income (and requests that payment be made under this paragraph), free of charge or at nominal charges to the public, the amount determined on the basis of those items (specified in regulations prescribed by the Secretary) included in the determination of such reasonable cost which the Secretary finds will provide fair compensation to such provider for such services; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if some or all of the hospitals in a State have been reimbursed for services (for which payment may be made under this part) pursuant to a reimbursement system approved as a demonstration project under section 402 of the Social Security Amendments of 1967 or section 222 of the Social Security Amendments of 1972, if the rate of increase in such hospitals in their costs per hospital inpatient admission of <!-- PDFPage:1735 -->individuals entitled to benefits under this part over the duration of such project was equal to or less than such rate of increase for admissions of such individuals with respect to all hospitals in the United States during such period, and if either the State has legislative authority to operate such system and the State elects to have reimbursement to such hospitals made in accordance with this paragraph or the system is operated through a voluntary agreement of hospitals and such hospitals elect to have reimbursement to those hospitals made in accordance with this paragraph, then the Secretary may provide for continuation of reimbursement to such hospitals under such system until the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a third-party payor reimburses such a hospital on a basis other than under such system, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the aggregate rate of increase from January 1, 1981, to the most recent date for which annual data are available in such hospitals in costs per hospital inpatient admission of individuals entitled to benefits under this part is greater than such rate of increase for admissions of such individuals with respect to all hospitals in the United States for such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of any State which has had such a demonstration project reimbursement system in continuous operation since July 1, 1977, the Secretary shall provide under paragraph (3) for continuation of reimbursement to hospitals in the State under such system until the first day of the 37th month beginning after the date the Secretary determines and notifies the Governor of the State that either of the conditions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of such paragraph has occurred. If, by the end of such 36-month period, the Secretary determines, based on evidence submitted by the Governor of the State, that neither of the conditions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (3) continues to apply, the Secretary shall continue without interruption payment to hospitals in the State under the State's system. If, by the end of such 36-month period, the Secretary determines, based on such evidence, that either of the conditions described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of such paragraph continues to apply, the Secretary shall (i) collect any net excess reimbursement to hospitals in the State during such 36-month period (basing such net excess reimbursement on the net difference, if any, in the rate of increase in costs per hospital inpatient admission under the State system compared to the rate of increase in such costs with respect to all hospitals in the United States over the 36-month period, as measured by including the cumulative savings under the State system based on the difference in the rate of increase in costs per hospital inpatient admission under the State system as compared to the rate of increase in such costs with respect to all hospitals in the United States between January 1, 1981, and the date of the Secretary's initial notice), and (ii) provide a reasonable period, not to exceed 2 years, for transition from the State system to the national payment system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) No payments to Federal providers of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 1395qq of this title, no payment may be made under this part (except under subsection (d) or subsection (h) of this section) to any Federal provider of services, except a provider of services which the Secretary determines is providing services to the public generally as a community institution or agency; and no such payment may be made to any provider of services for any item or service which such provider is obligated by a law of, or a contract with, the United States to render at public expense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments for emergency hospital services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payments shall also be made to any hospital for inpatient hospital services furnished in a calendar year, by the hospital or under arrangements (as defined in section 1395x(w) of this title) with it, to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title even though such hospital does not have an agreement in effect under this subchapter if (A) such services were emergency services, (B) the Secretary would be required to make such payment if the hospital had such an agreement in effect and otherwise met the conditions of payment hereunder, and (C) such hospital has elected to claim payments for all such inpatient emergency services and for the emergency outpatient services referred to in section 1395n(b) of this title furnished during such year. Such payments shall be made only in the amounts provided under subsection (b) of this section and then only if such hospital agrees to comply, with respect to the emergency services provided, with the provisions of section 1395cc(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payment may be made on the basis of an itemized bill to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title for services described in paragraph (1) which are emergency services if (A) payment cannot be made under paragraph (1) solely because the hospital does not elect to claim such payment, and (B) such individual files application (submitted within such time and in such form and manner and by such person, and containing and supported by such information as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) for reimbursement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amounts payable under the preceding paragraph with respect to services described therein shall, subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, be equal to 60 percent of the hospital's reasonable charges for routine services furnished in the accommodations occupied by the individual or in semiprivate accommodations (as defined in section 1395x(v)(4) of this title), whichever is less, plus 80 percent of the hospital's reasonable charges for ancillary services. If separate charges for routine and ancillary services are not made by the hospital, reimbursement may be based on two-thirds of the hospital's reasonable charges for the services received but not to exceed the charges which would have been made if the patient had occupied semiprivate accommodations. For purposes of the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;routine services&rdquo; shall mean the regular room, dietary, and nursing services, minor medical and surgical supplies and the use of <!-- PDFPage:1736 -->equipment and facilities for which a separate charge is not customarily made; the term &ldquo;ancillary services&rdquo; shall mean those special services for which charges are customarily made in addition to routine services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment for inpatient hospital services prior to notification of noneligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding that an individual is not entitled to have payment made under this part for inpatient hospital services furnished by any hospital, payment shall be made to such hospital (unless it elects not to receive such payment or, if payment has already been made by or on behalf of such individual, fails to refund such payment within the time specified by the Secretary) for such services which are furnished to the individual prior to notification to such hospital from the Secretary of his lack of entitlement, if such payments are precluded only by reason of section 1395d of this title and if such hospital complies with the requirements of and regulations under this subchapter with respect to such payments, has acted in good faith and without knowledge of such lack of entitlement, and has acted reasonably in assuming entitlement existed. Payment under the preceding sentence may not be made for services furnished an individual pursuant to any admission after the 6th elapsed day (not including as an elapsed day Saturday, Sunday, or a legal holiday) after the day on which such admission occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment for certain inpatient hospital services furnished outside United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payment shall be made for inpatient hospital services furnished to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title by a hospital located outside the United States, or under arrangements (as defined in section 1395x(w) of this title) with it, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such individual is a resident of the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such hospital was closer to, or substantially more accessible from, the residence of such individual than the nearest hospital within the United States which was adequately equipped to deal with, and was available for the treatment of, such individual's illness or injury.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payment may also be made for emergency inpatient hospital services furnished to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title by a hospital located outside the United States if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such individual was physically present&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in a place within the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at a place within Canada while traveling without unreasonable delay by the most direct route (as determined by the Secretary) between Alaska and another State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">at the time the emergency which necessitated such inpatient hospital services occurred, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such hospital was closer to, or substantially more accessible from, such place than the nearest hospital within the United States which was adequately equipped to deal with, and was available for the treatment of, such individual's illness or injury.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Payment shall be made in the amount provided under subsection (b) of this section to any hospital for the inpatient hospital services described in paragraph (1) or (2) furnished to an individual by the hospital or under arrangements (as defined in section 1395x(w) of this title) with it if (A) the Secretary would be required to make such payment if the hospital had an agreement in effect under this subchapter and otherwise met the conditions of payment hereunder, (B) such hospital elects to claim such payment, and (C) such hospital agrees to comply, with respect to such services, with the provisions of section 1395cc(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Payment for the inpatient hospital services described in paragraph (1) or (2) furnished to an individual entitled to hospital insurance benefits under section 426 of this title may be made on the basis of an itemized bill to such individual if (A) payment for such services cannot be made under paragraph (3) solely because the hospital does not elect to claim such payment, and (B) such individual files application (submitted within such time and in such form and manner and by such person, and continuing and supported by such information as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) for reimbursement. The amount payable with respect to such services shall, subject to the provisions of section 1395e of this title, be equal to the amount which would be payable under subsection (d)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payments to physicians for services rendered in teaching hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of services for which the reasonable cost thereof is determined under section 1395x(v)(1)(D) of this title (or would be if section 1395ww of this title did not apply), payment under this part shall be made to such fund as may be designated by the organized medical staff of the hospital in which such services were furnished or, if such services were furnished in such hospital by the faculty of a medical school, to such fund as may be designated by such faculty, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such hospital has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1395cc of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Secretary has received written assurances that (A) such payment will be used by such fund solely for the improvement of care of hospital patients or for educational or charitable purposes and (B) the individuals who were furnished such services or any other persons will not be charged for such services (or if charged, provision will be made for return of any moneys incorrectly collected).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Payment for specified hospital services provided in Department of Veterans Affairs hospitals; amount of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payments shall also be made to any hospital operated by the Department of Veterans Affairs for inpatient hospital services furnished in a calendar year by the hospital, or under arrangements (as defined in section 1395x(w) of this title) with it, to an individual entitled to hospital benefits under section 426 of this title even though the hospital is a Federal provider of services if (A) the individual was not entitled to have the services furnished to him free of charge by the hospital, (B) the individual was admitted to the hospital in the reasonable belief on the <!-- PDFPage:1737 -->part of the admitting authorities that the individual was a person who was entitled to have the services furnished to him free of charge, (C) the authorities of the hospital, in admitting the individual, and the individual, acted in good faith, and (D) the services were furnished during a period ending with the close of the day on which the authorities operating the hospital first became aware of the fact that the individual was not entitled to have the services furnished to him by the hospital free of charge, or (if later) ending with the first day on which it was medically feasible to remove the individual from the hospital by discharging him therefrom or transferring him to a hospital which has in effect an agreement under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payment for services described in paragraph (1) shall be in an amount equal to the charge imposed by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs for such services, or (if less) the amount that would be payable for such services under subsection (b) of this section and section 1395ww of this title (as estimated by the Secretary). Any such payment shall be made to the entity to which payment for the services involved would have been payable, if payment for such services had been made by the individual receiving the services involved (or by another private person acting on behalf of such individual).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Payment for hospice care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Subject to the limitation under paragraph (2) and the provisions of section 1395e(a)(4) of this title and except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the amount paid to a hospice program with respect to hospice care for which payment may be made under this part shall be an amount equal to the costs which are reasonable and related to the cost of providing hospice care or which are based on such other tests of reasonableness as the Secretary may prescribe in regulations (including those authorized under section 1395x(v)(1)(A) of this title), except that no payment may be made for bereavement counseling and no reimbursement may be made for other counseling services (including nutritional and dietary counseling) as separate services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for hospice care furnished on or after April 1, 1986, the daily rate of payment per day for routine home care shall be $63.17 and the daily rate of payment for other services included in hospice care shall be the daily rate of payment recognized under subparagraph (A) as of July 1, 1985, increased by $10.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) With respect to routine home care and other services included in hospice care furnished on or after January 1, 1990, and on or before September 30, 1990, the payment rates for such care and services shall be 120 percent of such rates in effect as of September 30, 1989.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) With respect to routine home care and other services included in hospice care furnished during a subsequent fiscal year, the payment rates for such care and services shall be the payment rates in effect under this subparagraph during the previous fiscal year increased by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) for a fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1993, the market basket percentage increase (as defined in section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title) for the fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) for fiscal year 1994, the market basket percentage increase for the fiscal year minus 2.0 percentage points;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) for fiscal year 1995, the market basket percentage increase for the fiscal year minus 1.5 percentage points;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) for fiscal year 1996, the market basket percentage increase for the fiscal year minus 1.5 percentage points;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) for fiscal year 1997, the market basket percentage increase for the fiscal year minus 0.5 percentage point;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VI) for each of fiscal years 1998 through 2002, the market basket percentage increase for the fiscal year involved minus 1.0 percentage points; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VII) for a subsequent fiscal year, the market basket percentage increase for the fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The amount of payment made under this part for hospice care provided by (or under arrangements made by) a hospice program for an accounting year may not exceed the &ldquo;cap amount&rdquo; for the year (computed under subparagraph (B)) multiplied by the number of medicare beneficiaries in the hospice program in that year (determined under subparagraph (C)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the &ldquo;cap amount&rdquo; for a year is $6,500, increased or decreased, for accounting years that end after October 1, 1984, by the same percentage as the percentage increase or decrease, respectively, in the medical care expenditure category of the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (United States city average), published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, from March 1984 to the fifth month of the accounting year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the &ldquo;number of medicare beneficiaries&rdquo; in a hospice program in an accounting year is equal to the number of individuals who have made an election under subsection (d) of this section with respect to the hospice program and have been provided hospice care by (or under arrangements made by) the hospice program under this part in the accounting year, such number reduced to reflect the proportion of hospice care that each such individual was provided in a previous or subsequent accounting year or under a plan of care established by another hospice program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A hospice program shall submit claims for payment for hospice care furnished in an individual's home under this subchapter only on the basis of the geographic location at which the service is furnished, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
