<!-- field-end:miscellaneous-note -->
<!-- field-end:notes -->
<!-- field-start:analysis -->
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">I</h4>
<p class="note-body">Today we face new challenges and unparalleled opportunities in the field of health. Building on the progress of the past several years, we have truly begun to match the achievements of our medicine to the needs of our people.</p>
<p class="note-body">The task ahead is immense. As a nation, we will unceasingly pursue our research and learning, our training and building, our testing and treatment. But now our concern must also turn to the organization of our Federal health programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">As citizens we are entitled to the very best health services our resources can provide.</p>
<p class="note-body">As taxpayers, we demand the most efficient and economic health organizations that can be devised.</p>
<p class="note-body">I ask the Congress to approve a reorganization plan to bring new strength to the administration of Federal health programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">I propose a series of changes in the organization of the Public Health Service that will bring to all Americans a structure modern in design, more efficient in operation and better prepared to meet the great and growing needs of the future. Through such improvements we can achieve the full promise of the landmark health legislation enacted by the 89th Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">I do not propose these changes lightly. They follow a period of careful deliberation. For many months the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, and the Surgeon General have consulted leading experts in the Nation&mdash;physicians, administrators, scientists, and public health specialists. They have confirmed my belief that modernization and reorganization of the Public Health Service are urgently required and long overdue.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">II</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Public Health Service is an operating agency of the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. It is the principal arm of the Federal Government in the field of health. Its programs are among those most vital to our well-being.</p>
<p class="note-body">Since 1953 more than 50 new programs have been placed in the Public Health Service. Its budget over the past 12 years has increased tenfold&mdash;from $250 million to $2.4 billion.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today the organization of the Public Health Service is clearly obsolete. The requirement that new and expanding programs be administered through an organizational structure established by law more than two decades ago stands as a major obstacle to the fulfillment of our Nation's health goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">As presently constituted, the Public Health Service is composed of four major components:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Bureau of State Services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Bureau of Medical Services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Office of the Surgeon General.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Under present law, Public Health Service functions must be assigned only to these four components.</p>
<p class="note-body">This structure was designed to provide separate administrative arrangements for health research, programs of State and local aid, health services, and executive staff resources. At a time when these functions could be neatly compartmentalized, the structure was adequate. But today the situation is different.</p>
<p class="note-body">Under recent legislation many new programs provide for an integrated attack on specific disease problems or health hazards in the environment by combining health services, State and local aid, and research. Each new program of this type necessarily is assigned to one of the three operating components of the Public Health Service. Yet none of these components is intended to administer programs involving such a variety of approaches.</p>
<p class="note-body">Our health problems are difficult enough without having them complicated by outmoded organizational arrangements.</p>
<p class="note-body">But if we merely take the step of integrating the four agencies within the Public Health Service we will not go far enough. More is required.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">III</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Department of Health, Education, and Welfare performs major health or health-related functions which are not carried out through the Public Health Service, although they are closely related to its functions. Among these are:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Health insurance for the aged, administered through the Social Security Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Medical assistance for the needy, administered through the Welfare Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Regulation of the manufacture, labeling, and distribution of drugs, carried out through the Food and Drug Administration; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Grants-in-aid to States for vocational rehabilitation of the handicapped, administered by the Vocational Rehabilitation Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Expenditures for health and health-related programs of the Department administered outside the Public Health Service have increased from $44 million in 1953 to an estimated $5.4 billion in 1967.</p>
<p class="note-body">As the head of the Department, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare is responsible for the Administration and coordination of all the Department's health functions. He has clear authority over the programs I have just mentioned.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:72 --><p class="note-body">But today he lacks this essential authority over the Public Health Service. The functions of that agency are vested in the Surgeon General and not in the Secretary.</p>
<p class="note-body">This diffusion of responsibility is unsound and unwise.</p>
<p class="note-body">To secure the highest possible level of health services for the American people the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare must be given the authority to establish&mdash;and modify as necessary&mdash;the organizational structure for Public Health Service programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">He must also have the authority to coordinate health functions throughout the Department. The reorganization plan I propose will accomplish these purposes. It will provide the Secretary with the flexibility to create new and responsive organizational arrangements to keep pace with the changing and dynamic nature of our health programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">My views in this respect follow a basic principle of good government set by the Hoover Commission in 1949 when it recommended that &ldquo;the Department head should be given authority to determine the organization within his Department.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">IV</h4>
<p class="note-body">In summary, the reorganization plan would:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Transfer to the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare the functions now vested in the Surgeon General of the Public Health Service and in its various subordinate units (this transfer will not affect certain statutory advisory bodies such as the National Advisory Cancer and Heart Councils);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Abolish the four principal statutory components of the Public Health Service, including the offices held by their heads (the Bureau of Medical Services, the Bureau of State Services, the National Institutes of Health exclusive of its several research institutes such as the National Cancer and Heart Institutes, and the Office of the Surgeon General); and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Authorize the Secretary to assign the functions transferred to him by the plan to officials and entities of the Public Health Service and to other agencies of the Department as he deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Thus, the Secretary would be&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Enabled to assure that all health functions of the Department are carried out as effectively and economically as possible;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Given authority commensurate with his responsibility; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">Made responsible in fact for matters for which he is now, in any case, held accountable by the President, the Congress, and the people.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">V</h4>
<p class="note-body">I have found, after investigation, that each reorganization included in the accompanying reorganization plan is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949, as amended.</p>
<p class="note-body">Should the reorganizations in the accompanying reorganization plan take effect, they will make possible more effective and efficient administration of the affected health programs. It is, however, not practicable at this time to itemize the reductions in expenditures which may result.</p>
<p class="note-body">I strongly recommend that the Congress allow the reorganization plan to become effective.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;210b. Professional categories</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Division of corps; basis of categories</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of establishing eligibility of officers of the Regular Corps for promotions, the Surgeon General shall by regulation divide the corps into professional categories. Each category shall, as far as practicable, be based upon one of the subjects of examination set forth in section 209(a)(1) of this title or upon a subdivision of such subject, and the categories shall be designed to group officers by fields of training in such manner that officers in any one grade in any one category will be available for similar duty in the discharge of the several functions of the Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assignment of officers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each officer of the Regular Corps on active duty shall, on the basis of his training and experience, be assigned by the Surgeon General to one of the categories established by regulations under subsection (a) of this section. Except upon amendment of such regulations, no assignment so made shall be changed unless the Surgeon General finds (1) that the original assignment was erroneous, or (2) that the officer is equally well qualified to serve in another category to which he has requested to be transferred, and that such transfer is in the interests of the Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Maximum number of officers in each category</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within the limits fixed by the Secretary in regulations under section 207(d) of this title for any fiscal year, the Surgeon General shall determine for each category in the Regular Corps the maximum number of officers authorized to be in each of the grades from the warrant officer (W&ndash;1) grade to the director grade, inclusive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Vacancies in grade for purposes of promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The excess of the number so fixed for any grade in any category over the number of officers of the Regular Corps on active duty in such grade in such category (including in the case of the director grade, officers holding such grade in accordance with section 207(c) of this title) shall for the purpose of promotions constitute vacancies in such grade in such category. For purposes of this subsection, an officer who has been temporarily promoted or who is temporarily holding the grade of director in accordance with section 207(c) of this title shall be deemed to hold the grade to which so promoted or which he is temporarily holding; but while he holds such promotion or grade, and while any officer is temporarily assigned to a position pursuant to section 206(c) of this title, the number fixed under subsection (c) of this section for the grade of his permanent rank shall be reduced by one.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Absence of vacancy in grade as affecting promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The absence of a vacancy in a grade in a category shall not prevent an appointment to such grade pursuant to section 209 of this title, a permanent length of service promotion, or the recall of a retired officer to active duty; but the making of such an appointment, promotion, or recall shall be deemed to fill a vacancy if one exists.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Vacancy in grade as affecting maximum number for each category</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a vacancy exists in any grade in a category the Surgeon General may increase by one the number fixed by him under subsection (c) of this section for the next lower grade in the same category, without regard to the numbers fixed in regulations under section 207(d) of this title; and in that event the vacancy in the higher grade shall not be filled except by a permanent promotion, and upon the making of such promotion the number for the next lower grade shall be reduced by one.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;211. Promotion of commissioned officers</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Permanent or temporary promotions; examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Promotions of officers of the Regular Corps to any grade up to and including the director grade <!-- PDFPage:85 -->shall be either permanent promotions based on length of service, other permanent promotions to fill vacancies, or temporary promotions. Permanent promotions shall be made by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, and temporary promotions shall be made by the President. Each permanent promotion shall be to the next higher grade, and shall be made only after examination given in accordance with regulations of the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Promotion to certain grades only to fill vacancies; regulations; &ldquo;restricted grade&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may by regulation provide that in a specified professional category permanent promotions to the senior grade, or to both the full grade and the senior grade, shall be made only if there are vacancies in such grade. A grade in any category with respect to which such regulations have been issued is referred to in this section as a &ldquo;restricted grade&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Examinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Examinations to determine qualification for permanent promotions may be either noncompetitive or competitive, as the Surgeon General shall in each case determine; except that examinations for promotions to the assistant or senior assistant grade shall in all cases be noncompetitive. The officers to be examined shall be selected by the Surgeon General from the professional category, and in the order of seniority in the grade, from which promotion is to be recommended. In the case of a competitive examination the Surgeon General shall determine in advance of the examination the number (which may be one or more) of officers who, after passing the examination, will be recommended to the President for promotion; but if the examination is one for promotions based on length of service, or is one for promotions to fill vacancies other than vacancies in the director grade or in a restricted grade, such number shall not be less than 80 per centum of the number of officers to be examined.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Permanent promotions to qualified officers on length of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Officers of the Regular Corps, found pursuant to subsection (c) of this section to be qualified, shall be given permanent promotions based on length of service, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Officers in the warrant officer (W&ndash;1) grade, chief warrant officer (W&ndash;2) grade, chief warrant officer (W&ndash;3) grade, chief warrant officer (W&ndash;4) grade, and junior assistant grade shall be promoted at such times as may be prescribed in regulations of the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Officers with permanent rank in the assistant grade, the senior assistant grade, and the full grade shall (except as provided in regulations under subsection (b) of this section) be promoted after completion of three, ten, and seventeen years, respectively, of service in grades above the junior assistant grade; and such promotions, when made, shall be effective, for purposes of pay and seniority in grade, as of the day following the completion of such years of service. An officer with permanent rank in the assistant, senior assistant, or full grade who has not completed such years of service shall be promoted at the same time, and his promotion shall be effective as of the same day, as any officer junior to him in the same grade in the same professional category who is promoted under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Promotion of professional category officers to fill certain vacancies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Officers in a professional category of the Regular Corps, found pursuant to subsection (c) of this section to be qualified, may be given permanent promotions to fill any or all vacancies in such category in the senior assistant grade, the full grade, the senior grade, or the director grade; but no officer who has not had one year of service with permanent or temporary rank in the next lower grade shall be promoted to any restricted grade or to the director grade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reexamination upon failure of promotion; effective date of promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an officer who has completed the years of service required for promotion to a grade under paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of this section fails to receive such promotion, he shall (unless he has already been twice examined for promotion to such grade) be once reexamined for promotion to such grade. If he is thereupon promoted (otherwise than under subsection (e) of this section), the effective date of such promotion shall be one year later than it would have been but for such failure. Upon the effective date of any permanent promotion of such officer to such grade, he shall be considered as having had only the length of service required for such promotion which he previously failed to receive.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Separation from service upon failure of promotion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If, for reasons other than physical disability, an officer of the Regular Corps in the warrant officer (W&ndash;1) grade or junior assistant grade is found pursuant to subsection (c) of this section not to be qualified for promotion he shall be separated from the Service. If, for reasons other than physical disability, an officer of the Regular Corps in the chief warrant officer (W&ndash;2), chief warrant officer (W&ndash;3), assistant, senior assistant, or full grade, after having been twice examined for promotion (other than promotion to a restricted grade), fails to be promoted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if in the chief warrant officer (W&ndash;2) or assistant grade he shall be separated from the Service and paid six months&rsquo; basic pay and allowances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if in the chief warrant officer (W&ndash;3) or senior assistant grade he shall be separated from the Service and paid one year's basic pay and allowances;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if in the full grade he shall be considered as not in line for promotion and shall, at such time thereafter as the Surgeon General may determine, be retired from the Service with retired pay (unless he is entitled to a greater amount by reason of another provision of law)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of an officer who first became a member of a uniformed service before September 8, 1980, at the rate of 21/2 percent of the retired pay base determined under section 1406(h) of title 10 for each year, <!-- PDFPage:86 -->not in excess of 30, of his active commissioned service in the Service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an officer who first became a member of a uniformed service on or after September 8, 1980, at the rate determined by multiplying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the retired pay base determined under section 1407 of title 10; by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the retired pay multiplier determined under section 1409 of such title for the number of years of his active commissioned service in the Service.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Separation from service upon refusal to stand examination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an officer of the Regular Corps, eligible to take an examination for promotion, refuses to take such examination, he may be separated from the Service in accordance with regulations of the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Review of record; separation from service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of his first three years of service, the record of each officer of the Regular Corps originally appointed to the senior assistant grade or above, shall be reviewed in accordance with regulations of the President and, if found not qualified for further service, he shall be separated from the Service and paid six months&rsquo; pay and allowances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Determination of order of seniority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The order of seniority of officers in a grade in the Regular Corps shall be determined, subject to the provisions of paragraph (2) of this subsection, by the relative length of time spent in active service after the effective date of each such officer's original appointment or permanent promotion to that grade. When permanent promotions of two or more officers to the same grade are effective on the same day, their relative seniority shall be the same as it was in the grade from which promoted. In all other cases of original appointments or permanent promotions (or both) to the same grade effective on the same day, relative seniority shall be determined in accordance with regulations of the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of an officer originally appointed in the Regular Corps to the grade of assistant or above, his seniority in the grade to which appointed shall be determined after inclusion, as service in such grade, of any active service in such grade or in any higher grade in the Reserve Corps, but (if the appointment is to the grade of senior assistant or above) only to the extent of whichever of the following is greater: (A) His active service in such grade or any higher grade in the Reserve Corps after the first day on which, under regulations in effect on the date of his appointment to the Regular Corps, he had the training and experience necessary for such appointment, or (B) the excess of his total active service in the Reserve Corps (above the grade of junior assistant) over three years if his appointment in the Regular Corps is to the senior assistant grade, over ten years if the appointment is to the full grade, or over seventeen years if the appointment is to the senior grade.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Temporary promotions; fill vacancy in higher grade; war or national emergency; selection of officers; termination of appointment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any commissioned officer of the Regular Corps in any grade in any professional category may be recommended to the President for temporary promotion to fill a vacancy in any higher grade in such category, up to and including the director grade. In time of war, or of national emergency proclaimed by the President, any commissioned officer of the Regular Corps in any grade in any professional category may be recommended to the President for promotion to any higher grade in such category, up to and including the director grade, whether or not a vacancy exists in such grade. The selection of officers to be recommended for temporary promotions shall be made in accordance with regulations of the President. Promotion of an officer recommended pursuant to this subsection may be made without regard to length of service, without examination, and without vacating his permanent appointment, and shall carry with it the pay and allowances of the grade to which promoted. Such promotions may be terminated at any time, as may be directed by the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Determination of requirements of Service by Secretary; assignment of Reserve Officers to professional categories; temporary promotions; termination of temporary promotions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the number of officers of the Regular Corps on active duty, plus the number of officers of the Reserve Corps who have been on active duty for thirty days or more, exceeds the authorized strength of the Regular Corps, the Secretary shall determine the requirements of the Service in each grade in each category, based upon the total number of officers so serving on active duty and the tasks being performed by the Service; and the Surgeon General shall thereupon assign each officer of the Reserve Corps on active duty to a professional category. If the Secretary finds that the number of officers fixed under section 210b(c) of this title for any grade and category (or the number of officers, including officers of the Reserve Corps, on active duty in such grade in such category, if such number is greater than the number fixed under section 210b(c) of this title) is insufficient to meet such requirements of the Service, officers of either the Regular Corps or the Reserve Corps may be recommended for temporary promotion to such grade in such category. Any such promotion may be terminated at any time, as may be directed by the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Acceptance of promotion; oath and affidavit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any officer of the Regular Corps, or any officer of the Reserve Corps on active duty, who is promoted to a higher grade shall, unless he expressly declines such promotion, be deemed for all purposes to have accepted such promotion; and shall not be required to renew his oath of office, or to execute a new affidavit as required by section 3332 of title 5.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Except as provided in paragraph (6), a commissioned officer retired pursuant to paragraph (1), (2), or (3) who was (in the case of an officer in the Reserve Corps) on active duty with the Service on the day preceding such retirement shall be entitled to receive retired pay at the rate of 21/2 per centum of the basic pay of the highest grade held by him as such officer and in which, in the case of a temporary promotion to such grade, he has performed active duty for not less than six months, (A) for each year of active service, or (B) if it results in higher retired pay, for each of the following years:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) his years of active service (determined without regard to subsection (d) of this section) as a member of a uniformed service; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a medical or dental officer, four years and, in the case of a medical officer, who has completed one year of medical internship or the equivalent thereof, one additional year, the four years and the one year to be reduced by the period of active service performed during such officer's attendance at medical school or dental school or during his medical internship; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the number of years of service with which he was entitled to be credited for purposes of basic pay on May 31, 1958, or (if higher) on any date prior thereto, reduced by any such year included under clause (i) and further reduced by any such year with which he was entitled to be credited under paragraphs (7) and (8) of section 205(a) of title 37 on any date before June 1, 1958;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Recall to active duty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A commissioned officer, retired for reasons other than for failure of promotion to the senior grade, may (1) if an officer of the Regular Corps or an officer of the Reserve Corps entitled to retired pay under subsection (a) of this section, be involuntarily recalled to active duty during such times as the Commissioned Corps constitutes a branch of the land or naval forces of the United States, and (2) if an officer of either the Regular or Reserve Corps, be recalled to active duty at any time with his consent.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Retirement or separation for physical disability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of retirement or separation for physical disability under chapter 61 of title 10, a commissioned officer of the Service shall be credited, in addition to the service described in section 1208(a)(2) of that title, with active service with the Public Health Service, other than as a commissioned officer, which the Surgeon General determines is comparable to service performed by commissioned officers of the Service, except that, if there are more than five years of such service, only the last five years thereof may be so credited.
