<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 0.25 percent to each State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) of the total amount of funds remaining after allocation under paragraph (1), an amount that is equal to the ratio that the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such State to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 1993 bears to the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by all States to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 1993.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Local distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General shall allocate among the units of general local government in a State the amount allocated to the State under paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Attorney General shall allocate to each unit of general local government an amount which bears the ratio that the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such unit to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 1993 bears to the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by all units in the State in which the unit is located to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 1993 multiplied by the ratio of the population living in all units in the State in which the unit is located that reported part 1 <!-- PDFPage:5874 -->violent crimes to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for 1993 bears to the population of the State; or if such data are not available for a unit, the ratio that the population of such unit bears to the population of all units in the State in which the unit is located for which data are not available multiplied by the ratio of the population living in units in the State in which the unit is located for which data are not available bears to the population of the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If under paragraph (2) a unit is allotted less than $5,000 for the payment period, the amount allotted shall be transferred to the Governor of the State who shall equitably distribute the allocation to all such units or consortia thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If there is in a State a unit of general local government that has been incorporated since the date of the collection of the data used by the Attorney General in making allocations pursuant to this section, the Attorney General shall allocate to this newly incorporated local government, out of the amount allocated to the State under this section, an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount allocated to the State as the population of the newly incorporated local government bears to the population of the State. If there is in the State a unit of general local government that has been annexed since the date of the collection of the data used by the Attorney General in making allocations pursuant to this section, the Attorney General shall pay the amount that would have been allocated to this local government to the unit of general local government that annexed it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unavailability of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, if data regarding part 1 violent crimes in any State for 1993 is unavailable or substantially inaccurate, the Attorney General shall utilize the best available comparable data regarding the number of violent crimes for 1993 for such State for the purposes of allocation of any funds under this part.</p>
