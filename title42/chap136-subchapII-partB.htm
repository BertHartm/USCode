<h4 class="note-head">National Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;367, Oct. 27, 2000, 114 Stat. 1412, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;National Police Athletic League Youth Enrichment Act of 2000&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The goals of the Police Athletic League are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) increase the academic success of youth participants in PAL programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) promote a safe, healthy environment for youth under the supervision of law enforcement personnel where mutual trust and respect can be built;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) increase school attendance by providing alternatives to suspensions and expulsions;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) reduce the juvenile crime rate in participating designated communities and the number of police calls involving juveniles during nonschool hours;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) provide youths with alternatives to drugs, alcohol, tobacco, and gang activity;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) create positive communications and interaction between youth and law enforcement personnel; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) prepare youth for the workplace.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Police Athletic League, during its 55-year history as a national organization, has proven to be a positive force in the communities it serves.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Police Athletic League is a network of 1,700 facilities serving over 3,000 communities. There are 320 PAL chapters throughout the United States, the Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, serving 1,500,000 youths, ages 5 to 18, nationwide.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Based on PAL chapter demographics, approximately 82 percent of the youths who benefit from PAL programs live in inner cities and urban areas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) PAL chapters are locally operated, volunteer-driven organizations. Although most PAL chapters are sponsored by a law enforcement agency, PAL chapters receive no direct funding from law enforcement agencies and are dependent in large part on support from the private sector, such as individuals, business leaders, corporations, and foundations. PAL chapters have been exceptionally successful in balancing public funds with private sector donations and maximizing community involvement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Today's youth face far greater risks than did their parents and grandparents. Law enforcement statistics demonstrate that youth between the ages of 12 and 17 are at risk of committing violent acts and being victims of violent acts between the hours of 3 p.m. and 8 p.m.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Greater numbers of students are dropping out of school and failing in school, even though the consequences of academic failure are more dire in 1999 than ever before.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Many distressed areas in the United States are still underserved by PAL chapters.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purpose of this Act is to provide adequate resources in the form of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) assistance for the 320 established PAL chapters to increase of services to the communities they are serving; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) seed money for the establishment of 250 (50 per year over a 5-year period) additional local PAL chapters in public housing projects and other distressed areas, including distressed areas with a majority population of Native Americans, by not later than fiscal year 2006.</p>
