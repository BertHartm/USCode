<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National Assessment and report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) shall conduct a National Assessment of Demand Response. The Commission shall, within 18 months of December 19, 2007, submit a report to Congress that includes each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Estimation of nationwide demand response potential in 5 and 10 year horizons, including data on a State-by-State basis, and a methodology for updates of such estimates on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Estimation of how much of this potential can be achieved within 5 and 10 years after December 19, 2007, accompanied by specific policy recommendations that if implemented can achieve the estimated potential. Such recommendations shall include options for funding and/or incentives for the development of demand response resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Commission shall further note any barriers to demand response programs offering flexible, non-discriminatory, and fairly compensatory terms for the services and benefits made available, and shall provide recommendations for overcoming such barriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Commission shall seek to take advantage of preexisting research and ongoing work, and shall insure that there is no duplication of effort.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) National Action Plan on Demand Response</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall further develop a National Action Plan on Demand Response, soliciting and accepting input and participation from a broad range of industry stakeholders, State regulatory utility commissioners, and non-governmental groups. The Commission shall seek consensus where possible, and decide on optimum solutions to issues that defy consensus. Such Plan shall be completed within 1 year after the completion of the National Assessment of Demand Response, and shall meet each of the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Identification of requirements for technical assistance to States to allow them to maximize the amount of demand response resources that can be developed and deployed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Design and identification of requirements for implementation of a national communications program that includes broad-based customer education and support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Development or identification of analytical tools, information, model regulatory provisions, model contracts, and other support materials for use by customers, States, utilities and demand response providers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation of Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon completion, the National Action Plan on Demand Response shall be published, together with any favorable and dissenting comments submitted by participants in its preparation. Six months after publication, the Commission, together with the Secretary of Energy, shall submit to Congress a proposal to implement the Action Plan, including specific proposed assignments of responsibility, proposed budget amounts, and any agreements secured for participation from State and other participants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to the Commission to carry out this section not more than $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010.</p>
