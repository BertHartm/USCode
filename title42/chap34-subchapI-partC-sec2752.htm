<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In order to receive an allocation pursuant to subparagraph (A) an institution shall be an eligible institution from which 50 percent or more of the Pell Grant recipients attending such eligible institution graduate or transfer to a 4-year institution of higher education.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) From the remainder of the amount appropriated pursuant to section 2751(b) of this title after making the allocations required by subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall allocate to each eligible institution which has an excess eligible amount an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as such excess eligible amount bears to the sum of the excess eligible amounts of all such eligible institutions (having such excess eligible amounts).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For any eligible institution, the excess eligible amount is the amount, if any, by which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the amount of that institution's need (as determined under subsection (c) of this section), divided by (ii) the sum of the need of all institutions (as so determined), multiplied by (iii) the amount appropriated pursuant to section 2751(b) of this title for the fiscal year; exceeds</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount required to be allocated to that institution under subsection (a) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) compute 25 percent of the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the average cost of attendance for all undergraduate students minus the expected family contribution determined under subparagraph (B) for that income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction shall not be less than zero;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) add the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) for each income category of dependent students; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) To determine the self-help need of an institution's eligible graduate and professional students, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish various income categories of graduate and professional students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish an expected family contribution for each income category of graduate and professional students, determined on the basis of the average expected family contribution (computed in accordance with part F of this title [20 U.S.C. 1087kk et seq.]) of a representative sample within each income category for the second preceding fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) determine the average cost of attendance for all graduate and professional students;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) subtract from the average cost of attendance for all graduate and professional students (determined under subparagraph (C)), the expected family contribution (determined under subparagraph (B)) for each income category, except that the amount computed by such subtraction for any income category shall not be less than zero;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) multiply the amounts determined under subparagraph (D) by the number of eligible students in each category; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) For purposes of paragraphs (2) and (3), the term &ldquo;average cost of attendance&rdquo; means the average of the attendance costs for undergraduate students and for graduate and professional students, which shall include (i) tuition and fees determined in accordance with subparagraph (B), (ii) standard living expenses determined in accordance with subparagraph (C), and (iii) books and supplies determined in accordance with subparagraph (D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The average undergraduate and graduate and professional tuition and fees described in subparagraph (A)(i) shall be computed on the basis of information reported by the institution to the Secretary, which shall include (i) total revenue received by the institution from undergraduate and graduate tuition and fees for the <!-- PDFPage:4094 -->second year preceding the year for which it is applying for an allocation, and (ii) the institution's enrollment for such second preceding year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The standard living expense described in subparagraph (A)(ii) is equal to 150 percent of the difference between the income protection allowance for a family of five with one in college and the income protection allowance for a family of six with one in college for a single independent student.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The allowance for books and supplies described in subparagraph (A)(iii) is equal to $450.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reallocation of excess allocations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If institutions return to the Secretary any portion of the sums allocated to such institutions under this section for any fiscal year, the Secretary shall reallot such excess to eligible institutions which used at least 5 percent of the total amount of funds granted to such institution under this section to compensate students employed in tutoring in reading and family literacy activities in the preceding fiscal year. Such excess funds shall be reallotted to institutions which qualify under this subsection on the same basis as excess eligible amounts are allocated to institutions pursuant to subsection (b) of this section. Funds received by institutions pursuant to this subsection shall be used to compensate students employed in community service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, under paragraph (1) of this subsection, an institution returns more than 10 percent of its allocation, the institution's allocation for the next fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount returned. The Secretary may waive this paragraph for a specific institution if the Secretary finds that enforcing this paragraph would be contrary to the interest of the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Filing deadlines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, from time to time, set dates before which institutions must file applications for allocations under this part.</p>
