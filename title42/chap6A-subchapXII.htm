<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) safe drinking water is essential to the protection of public health;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) because the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300f et seq.) now exceed the financial and technical capacity of some public water systems, especially many small public water systems, the Federal Government needs to provide assistance to communities to help the communities meet Federal drinking water requirements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Federal Government commits to maintaining and improving its partnership with the States in the administration and implementation of the Safe Drinking Water Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) States play a central role in the implementation of safe drinking water programs, and States need increased financial resources and appropriate flexibility to ensure the prompt and effective development and implementation of drinking water programs;</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) prevention of drinking water contamination through well-trained system operators, water systems with adequate managerial, technical, and financial capacity, and enhanced protection of source waters of public water systems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) compliance with the requirements of the Safe Drinking Water Act continues to be a concern at public water systems experiencing technical and financial limitations, and Federal, State, and local governments need more resources and more effective authority to attain the objectives of the Safe Drinking Water Act; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National primary drinking water regulations; maximum contaminant level goals; simultaneous publication of regulations and goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Effective on June 19, 1986, each national interim or revised primary drinking water regulation promulgated under this section before June 19, 1986, shall be deemed to be a national primary drinking water regulation under subsection (b) of this section. No such regulation shall be required to comply with the standards set forth in subsection (b)(4) of this section unless such regulation is amended to establish a different maximum contaminant level after June 19, 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After June 19, 1986, each recommended maximum contaminant level published before <!-- PDFPage:869 -->June 19, 1986, shall be treated as a maximum contaminant level goal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a national primary drinking water regulation is proposed under subsection (b) of this section for any contaminant, the maximum contaminant level goal for such contaminant shall be proposed simultaneously. Whenever a national primary drinking water regulation is promulgated under subsection (b) of this section for any contaminant, the maximum contaminant level goal for such contaminant shall be published simultaneously.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (3) shall not apply to any recommended maximum contaminant level published before June 19, 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) <cap-smallcap>Identification of contaminants for listing.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>General authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall, in accordance with the procedures established by this subsection, publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant (other than a contaminant referred to in paragraph (2) for which a national primary drinking water regulation has been promulgated as of August 6, 1996) if the Administrator determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the contaminant may have an adverse effect on the health of persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the contaminant is known to occur or there is a substantial likelihood that the contaminant will occur in public water systems with a frequency and at levels of public health concern; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) in the sole judgment of the Administrator, regulation of such contaminant presents a meaningful opportunity for health risk reduction for persons served by public water systems.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Regulation of unregulated contaminants.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Listing of contaminants for consideration</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(I) Not later than 18 months after August 6, 1996, and every 5 years thereafter, the Administrator, after consultation with the scientific community, including the Science Advisory Board, after notice and opportunity for public comment, and after considering the occurrence data base established under section 300j&ndash;4(g) of this title, shall publish a list of contaminants which, at the time of publication, are not subject to any proposed or promulgated national primary drinking water regulation, which are known or anticipated to occur in public water systems, and which may require regulation under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) The unregulated contaminants considered under subclause (I) shall include, but not be limited to, substances referred to in section 9601(14) of this title, and substances registered as pesticides under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act [7 U.S.C. 136 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) The Administrator's decision whether or not to select an unregulated contaminant for a list under this clause shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Determination to regulate</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(I) Not later than 5 years after August 6, 1996, and every 5 years thereafter, the Administrator shall, after notice of the preliminary determination and opportunity for public comment, for not fewer than 5 contaminants included on the list published under clause (i), make determinations of whether or not to regulate such contaminants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) A determination to regulate a contaminant shall be based on findings that the criteria of clauses (i), (ii), and (iii) of subparagraph (A) are satisfied. Such findings shall be based on the best available public health information, including the occurrence data base established under section 300j&ndash;4(g) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) The Administrator may make a determination to regulate a contaminant that does not appear on a list under clause (i) if the determination to regulate is made pursuant to subclause (II).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) A determination under this clause not to regulate a contaminant shall be considered final agency action and subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each document setting forth the determination for a contaminant under clause (ii) shall be available for public comment at such time as the determination is published.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Priorities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In selecting unregulated contaminants for consideration under subparagraph (B), the Administrator shall select contaminants that present the greatest public health concern. The Administrator, in making such selection, shall take into consideration, among other factors of public health concern, the effect of such contaminants upon subgroups that comprise a meaningful portion of the general population (such as infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, or other subpopulations) that are identifiable as being at greater risk of adverse health effects due to exposure to contaminants in drinking water than the general population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Urgent threats to public health</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may promulgate an interim national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant without making a determination for the contaminant under paragraph (4)(C), or completing the analysis under paragraph (3)(C), to address an urgent threat to public health as determined by the Administrator after consultation with and written response to any comments provided by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, acting through the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the director of the National Institutes of Health. A determination for any contaminant in accordance with paragraph (4)(C) subject to an interim regulation under this subparagraph shall be issued, and a completed analysis meeting the requirements of paragraph (3)(C) shall be published, not later than 3 years after the date on which the regulation is promulgated and the regulation shall be repromulgated, or revised if appropriate, not later than 5 years after that date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Regulation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For each contaminant that the Administrator determines to regulate under subparagraph (B), the Administrator <!-- PDFPage:870 -->shall publish maximum contaminant level goals and promulgate, by rule, national primary drinking water regulations under this subsection. The Administrator shall propose the maximum contaminant level goal and national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant not later than 24 months after the determination to regulate under subparagraph (B), and may publish such proposed regulation concurrent with the determination to regulate. The Administrator shall publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation within 18 months after the proposal thereof. The Administrator, by notice in the Federal Register, may extend the deadline for such promulgation for up to 9 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) <cap-smallcap>Health advisories and other actions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may publish health advisories (which are not regulations) or take other appropriate actions for contaminants not subject to any national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) <cap-smallcap>Schedules and deadlines.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case of the contaminants listed in the Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking published in volume 47, Federal Register, page 9352, and in volume 48, Federal Register, page 45502, the Administrator shall publish maximum contaminant level goals and promulgate national primary drinking water regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) not later than 1 year after June 19, 1986, for not fewer than 9 of the listed contaminants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) not later than 2 years after June 19, 1986, for not fewer than 40 of the listed contaminants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) not later than 3 years after June 19, 1986, for the remainder of the listed contaminants.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Substitution of contaminants</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator identifies a drinking water contaminant the regulation of which, in the judgment of the Administrator, is more likely to be protective of public health (taking into account the schedule for regulation under subparagraph (A)) than a contaminant referred to in subparagraph (A), the Administrator may publish a maximum contaminant level goal and promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation for the identified contaminant in lieu of regulating the contaminant referred to in subparagraph (A). Substitutions may be made for not more than 7 contaminants referred to in subparagraph (A). Regulation of a contaminant identified under this subparagraph shall be in accordance with the schedule applicable to the contaminant for which the substitution is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Disinfectants and disinfection byproducts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall promulgate an Interim Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, a Final Enhanced Surface Water Treatment Rule, a Stage I Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule, and a Stage II Disinfectants and Disinfection Byproducts Rule in accordance with the schedule published in volume 59, Federal Register, page 6361 (February 10, 1994), in table III.13 of the proposed Information Collection Rule. If a delay occurs with respect to the promulgation of any rule in the schedule referred to in this subparagraph, all subsequent rules shall be completed as expeditiously as practicable but no later than a revised date that reflects the interval or intervals for the rules in the schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Risk assessment, management, and communication.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Use of science in decisionmaking</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, and, to the degree that an Agency action is based on science, the Administrator shall use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the best available, peer-reviewed science and supporting studies conducted in accordance with sound and objective scientific practices; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) data collected by accepted methods or best available methods (if the reliability of the method and the nature of the decision justifies use of the data).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Public information</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In carrying out this section, the Administrator shall ensure that the presentation of information on public health effects is comprehensive, informative, and understandable. The Administrator shall, in a document made available to the public in support of a regulation promulgated under this section, specify, to the extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) each population addressed by any estimate of public health effects;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the expected risk or central estimate of risk for the specific populations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) each appropriate upper-bound or lower-bound estimate of risk;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) each significant uncertainty identified in the process of the assessment of public health effects and studies that would assist in resolving the uncertainty; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) peer-reviewed studies known to the Administrator that support, are directly relevant to, or fail to support any estimate of public health effects and the methodology used to reconcile inconsistencies in the scientific data.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Health risk reduction and cost analysis.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>Maximum contaminant levels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When proposing any national primary drinking water regulation that includes a maximum contaminant level, the Administrator shall, with respect to a maximum contaminant level that is being considered in accordance with paragraph (4) and each alternative maximum contaminant level that is being considered pursuant to paragraph (5) or (6)(A), publish, seek public comment on, and use for the purposes of paragraphs (4), (5), and (6) an analysis of each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) Quantifiable and nonquantifiable health risk reduction benefits for which there is a factual basis in the rulemaking record to conclude that such benefits are likely to occur as the result of treatment to comply with each level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) Quantifiable and nonquantifiable health risk reduction benefits for which there is a factual basis in the rulemaking record to conclude that such benefits are <!-- PDFPage:871 -->likely to occur from reductions in co-occurring contaminants that may be attributed solely to compliance with the maximum contaminant level, excluding benefits resulting from compliance with other proposed or promulgated regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) Quantifiable and nonquantifiable costs for which there is a factual basis in the rulemaking record to conclude that such costs are likely to occur solely as a result of compliance with the maximum contaminant level, including monitoring, treatment, and other costs and excluding costs resulting from compliance with other proposed or promulgated regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(IV) The incremental costs and benefits associated with each alternative maximum contaminant level considered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(V) The effects of the contaminant on the general population and on groups within the general population such as infants, children, pregnant women, the elderly, individuals with a history of serious illness, or other subpopulations that are identified as likely to be at greater risk of adverse health effects due to exposure to contaminants in drinking water than the general population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(VI) Any increased health risk that may occur as the result of compliance, including risks associated with co-occurring contaminants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(VII) Other relevant factors, including the quality and extent of the information, the uncertainties in the analysis supporting subclauses (I) through (VI), and factors with respect to the degree and nature of the risk.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Treatment techniques</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;When proposing a national primary drinking water regulation that includes a treatment technique in accordance with paragraph (7)(A), the Administrator shall publish and seek public comment on an analysis of the health risk reduction benefits and costs likely to be experienced as the result of compliance with the treatment technique and alternative treatment techniques that are being considered, taking into account, as appropriate, the factors described in clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Approaches to measure and value benefits</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may identify valid approaches for the measurement and valuation of benefits under this subparagraph, including approaches to identify consumer willingness to pay for reductions in health risks from drinking water contaminants.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Authorization</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There are authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator, acting through the Office of Ground Water and Drinking Water, to conduct studies, assessments, and analyses in support of regulations or the development of methods, $35,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1996 through 2003.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Goals and standards.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Maximum contaminant level goals</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each maximum contaminant level goal established under this subsection shall be set at the level at which no known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons occur and which allows an adequate margin of safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Maximum contaminant levels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in paragraphs (5) and (6), each national primary drinking water regulation for a contaminant for which a maximum contaminant level goal is established under this subsection shall specify a maximum contaminant level for such contaminant which is as close to the maximum contaminant level goal as is feasible.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Determination</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;At the time the Administrator proposes a national primary drinking water regulation under this paragraph, the Administrator shall publish a determination as to whether the benefits of the maximum contaminant level justify, or do not justify, the costs based on the analysis conducted under paragraph (3)(C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Definition of feasible</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For the purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;feasible&rdquo; means feasible with the use of the best technology, treatment techniques and other means which the Administrator finds, after examination for efficacy under field conditions and not solely under laboratory conditions, are available (taking cost into consideration). For the purpose of this paragraph, granular activated carbon is feasible for the control of synthetic organic chemicals, and any technology, treatment technique, or other means found to be the best available for the control of synthetic organic chemicals must be at least as effective in controlling synthetic organic chemicals as granular activated carbon.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) <cap-smallcap>Feasible technologies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Each national primary drinking water regulation which establishes a maximum contaminant level shall list the technology, treatment techniques, and other means which the Administrator finds to be feasible for purposes of meeting such maximum contaminant level, but a regulation under this subsection shall not require that any specified technology, treatment technique, or other means be used for purposes of meeting such maximum contaminant level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>List of technologies for small systems</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall include in the list any technology, treatment technique, or other means that is affordable, as determined by the Administrator in consultation with the States, for small public water systems serving&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) a population of 10,000 or fewer but more than 3,300;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) a population of 3,300 or fewer but more than 500; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) a population of 500 or fewer but more than 25;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">and that achieves compliance with the maximum contaminant level or treatment technique, including packaged or modular systems and point-of-entry or point-of-use treatment units. Point-of-entry and point-of-use treatment units shall be owned, controlled and maintained by the public water system or by a person under contract with <!-- PDFPage:872 -->the public water system to ensure proper operation and maintenance and compliance with the maximum contaminant level or treatment technique and equipped with mechanical warnings to ensure that customers are automatically notified of operational problems. The Administrator shall not include in the list any point-of-use treatment technology, treatment technique, or other means to achieve compliance with a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique requirement for a microbial contaminant (or an indicator of a microbial contaminant). If the American National Standards Institute has issued product standards applicable to a specific type of point-of-entry or point-of-use treatment unit, individual units of that type shall not be accepted for compliance with a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique requirement unless they are independently certified in accordance with such standards. In listing any technology, treatment technique, or other means pursuant to this clause, the Administrator shall consider the quality of the source water to be treated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>List of technologies that achieve compliance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Except as provided in clause (v), not later than 2 years after August 6, 1996, and after consultation with the States, the Administrator shall issue a list of technologies that achieve compliance with the maximum contaminant level or treatment technique for each category of public water systems described in subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (ii) for each national primary drinking water regulation promulgated prior to June 19, 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) <cap-smallcap>Additional technologies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may, at any time after a national primary drinking water regulation has been promulgated, supplement the list of technologies describing additional or new or innovative treatment technologies that meet the requirements of this paragraph for categories of small public water systems described in subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (ii) that are subject to the regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(v) <cap-smallcap>Technologies that meet surface water treatment rule</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Within one year after August 6, 1996, the Administrator shall list technologies that meet the Surface Water Treatment Rule for each category of public water systems described in subclauses (I), (II), and (III) of clause (ii).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) <cap-smallcap>Additional health risk considerations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (4), the Administrator may establish a maximum contaminant level for a contaminant at a level other than the feasible level, if the technology, treatment techniques, and other means used to determine the feasible level would result in an increase in the health risk from drinking water by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) increasing the concentration of other contaminants in drinking water; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) interfering with the efficacy of drinking water treatment techniques or processes that are used to comply with other national primary drinking water regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Establishment of level</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator establishes a maximum contaminant level or levels or requires the use of treatment techniques for any contaminant or contaminants pursuant to the authority of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the level or levels or treatment techniques shall minimize the overall risk of adverse health effects by balancing the risk from the contaminant and the risk from other contaminants the concentrations of which may be affected by the use of a treatment technique or process that would be employed to attain the maximum contaminant level or levels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the combination of technology, treatment techniques, or other means required to meet the level or levels shall not be more stringent than is feasible (as defined in paragraph (4)(D)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) <cap-smallcap>Additional health risk reduction and cost considerations.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Notwithstanding paragraph (4), if the Administrator determines based on an analysis conducted under paragraph (3)(C) that the benefits of a maximum contaminant level promulgated in accordance with paragraph (4) would not justify the costs of complying with the level, the Administrator may, after notice and opportunity for public comment, promulgate a maximum contaminant level for the contaminant that maximizes health risk reduction benefits at a cost that is justified by the benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Exception</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator shall not use the authority of this paragraph to promulgate a maximum contaminant level for a contaminant, if the benefits of compliance with a national primary drinking water regulation for the contaminant that would be promulgated in accordance with paragraph (4) experienced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) persons served by large public water systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) persons served by such other systems as are unlikely, based on information provided by the States, to receive a variance under section 300g&ndash;4(e) of this title (relating to small system variances);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">would justify the costs to the systems of complying with the regulation. This subparagraph shall not apply if the contaminant is found almost exclusively in small systems eligible under section 300g&ndash;4(e) of this title for a small system variance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Disinfectants and disinfection byproducts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Administrator may not use the authority of this paragraph to establish a maximum contaminant level in a Stage I or Stage II national primary drinking water regulation (as described in paragraph (2)(C)) for contaminants that are disinfectants or disinfection byproducts, or to establish a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique requirement for the control of cryptosporidium. The authority of this paragraph may be used to establish regulations for the use of disinfection by systems relying on ground water sources as required by paragraph (8).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Judicial review</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A determination by the Administrator that the benefits of a maxi<!-- PDFPage:873 -->mum contaminant level or treatment requirement justify or do not justify the costs of complying with the level shall be reviewed by the court pursuant to section 300j&ndash;7 of this title only as part of a review of a final national primary drinking water regulation that has been promulgated based on the determination and shall not be set aside by the court under that section unless the court finds that the determination is arbitrary and capricious.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) The Administrator is authorized to promulgate a national primary drinking water regulation that requires the use of a treatment technique in lieu of establishing a maximum contaminant level, if the Administrator makes a finding that it is not economically or technologically feasible to ascertain the level of the contaminant. In such case, the Administrator shall identify those treatment techniques which, in the Administrator's judgment, would prevent known or anticipated adverse effects on the health of persons to the extent feasible. Such regulations shall specify each treatment technique known to the Administrator which meets the requirements of this paragraph, but the Administrator may grant a variance from any specified treatment technique in accordance with section 300g&ndash;4(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any schedule referred to in this subsection for the promulgation of a national primary drinking water regulation for any contaminant shall apply in the same manner if the regulation requires a treatment technique in lieu of establishing a maximum contaminant level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Not later than 18 months after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall propose and promulgate national primary drinking water regulations specifying criteria under which filtration (including coagulation and sedimentation, as appropriate) is required as a treatment technique for public water systems supplied by surface water sources. In promulgating such rules, the Administrator shall consider the quality of source waters, protection afforded by watershed management, treatment practices (such as disinfection and length of water storage) and other factors relevant to protection of health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In lieu of the provisions of section 300g&ndash;4 of this title the Administrator shall specify procedures by which the State determines which public water systems within its jurisdiction shall adopt filtration under the criteria of clause (i). The State may require the public water system to provide studies or other information to assist in this determination. The procedures shall provide notice and opportunity for public hearing on this determination. If the State determines that filtration is required, the State shall prescribe a schedule for compliance by the public water system with the filtration requirement. A schedule shall require compliance within 18 months of a determination made under clause (iii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Within 18 months from the time that the Administrator establishes the criteria and procedures under this subparagraph, a State with primary enforcement responsibility shall adopt any necessary regulations to implement this subparagraph. Within 12 months of adoption of such regulations the State shall make determinations regarding filtration for all the public water systems within its jurisdiction supplied by surface waters.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) If a State does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems, the Administrator shall have the same authority to make the determination in clause (ii) in such State as the State would have under that clause. Any filtration requirement or schedule under this subparagraph shall be treated as if it were a requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) As an additional alternative to the regulations promulgated pursuant to clauses (i) and (iii), including the criteria for avoiding filtration contained in 40 CFR 141.71, a State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems may, on a case-by-case basis, and after notice and opportunity for public comment, establish treatment requirements as an alternative to filtration in the case of systems having uninhabited, undeveloped watersheds in consolidated ownership, and having control over access to, and activities in, those watersheds, if the State determines (and the Administrator concurs) that the quality of the source water and the alternative treatment requirements established by the State ensure greater removal or inactivation efficiencies of pathogenic organisms for which national primary drinking water regulations have been promulgated or that are of public health concern than would be achieved by the combination of filtration and chlorine disinfection (in compliance with this section).</p>

The Administrator shall provide any assumptions used in determining affordability, taking into consideration the number of persons served by such systems. The Administrator shall provide as much reliable information as practicable on performance, effectiveness, limitations, costs, and other relevant factors including the applicability of variance technology to waters from surface and underground sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Regulations and guidance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 2 years after August 6, 1996, and after consultation with the States, the Administrator shall issue guidance or regulations under subparagraph (A) for each national primary drinking water regulation promulgated prior to August 6, 1996, for which a variance may be granted under section 300g&ndash;4(e) of this title. The Administrator may, at any time after a national primary drinking water regulation has been promulgated, issue guidance or regulations describing additional variance technologies. The Administrator shall, not less often than every 7 years, or upon receipt of a petition supported by substantial information, review variance technologies identified under this paragraph. The Administrator shall issue revised guidance or regulations if new or innovative variance technologies become available that meet the requirements of this paragraph and achieve an equal or greater reduction or inactivation efficiency than the variance technologies previously identified under this subparagraph. No public water system shall be required to replace a variance technology during the useful life of the technology for the sole reason that a more efficient variance technology has been listed under this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Secondary regulations; publication of proposed regulations; promulgation; amendments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall publish proposed national secondary drinking water regulations within 270 days after December 16, 1974.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State exercising primary enforcement responsibility may establish, by rule, after notice and public comment, alternative requirements with respect to the form and content of consumer confidence reports under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice of noncompliance with secondary drinking water regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, on the basis of information available to him, the Administrator finds that within a reasonable time after national secondary drinking water regulations have been promulgated, one or more public water systems in a State do not comply with such secondary regulations, and that such noncompliance appears to result from a failure of such State to take reasonable action to assure that public water systems throughout such State meet such secondary regulations, he shall so notify the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State authority to adopt or enforce laws or regulations respecting drinking water regulations or public water systems unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall diminish any authority of a State or political subdivision to adopt or enforce any law or regulation respecting drinking water regulations or public water systems, but no such law or regulation shall relieve any person of any requirement otherwise applicable under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notice and public hearing; availability of recommendations transmitted to State and public water system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator makes a finding of noncompliance (described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section) with respect to a public water system in a State which has primary enforcement responsibility, the Administrator may, for the purpose of assisting that State in carrying out such responsibility and upon the petition of such State or public water system or persons served by such system, hold, after appropriate notice, public hearings for the purpose of gathering information from technical or other experts, Federal, State, or other public officials, representatives of such public water system, persons served by such system, and other interested persons on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ways in which such system can within the earliest feasible time be brought into compliance with the regulation or requirement with respect to which such finding was made, and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:883 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the means for the maximum feasible protection of the public health during any period in which such system is not in compliance with a national primary drinking water regulation or requirement applicable to a variance or exemption.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">On the basis of such hearings the Administrator shall issue recommendations which shall be sent to such State and public water system and shall be made available to the public and communications media.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Administrative order requiring compliance; notice and hearing; civil penalty; civil actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which the Administrator is authorized to bring a civil action under this section or under section 300j&ndash;4 of this title with respect to any applicable requirement, the Administrator also may issue an order to require compliance with such applicable requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order issued under this subsection shall not take effect, in the case of a State having primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in that State, until after the Administrator has provided the State with an opportunity to confer with the Administrator regarding the order. A copy of any order issued under this subsection shall be sent to the appropriate State agency of the State involved if the State has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in that State. Any order issued under this subsection shall state with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation. In any case in which an order under this subsection is issued to a corporation, a copy of such order shall be issued to appropriate corporate officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any person who violates, or fails or refuses to comply with, an order under this subsection shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In a case in which a civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this paragraph does not exceed $5,000, the penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator after notice and opportunity for a public hearing (unless the person against whom the penalty is assessed requests a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5). In a case in which a civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this paragraph exceeds $5,000, but does not exceed $25,000, the penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Whenever any civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this subsection for a violation of an applicable requirement exceeds $25,000, the penalty shall be assessed by a civil action brought by the Administrator in the appropriate United States district court (as determined under the provisions of title 28).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court of appeals has entered final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Attorney General shall recover the amount for which such person is liable in any appropriate district court of the United States. In any such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Consolidation incentive</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An owner or operator of a public water system may submit to the State in which the system is located (if the State has primary enforcement responsibility under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title) or to the Administrator (if the State does not have primary enforcement responsibility) a plan (including specific measures and schedules) for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the physical consolidation of the system with 1 or more other systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the consolidation of significant management and administrative functions of the system with 1 or more other systems; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the transfer of ownership of the system that may reasonably be expected to improve drinking water quality.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consequences of approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the State or the Administrator approves a plan pursuant to paragraph (1), no enforcement action shall be taken pursuant to this part with respect to a specific violation identified in the approved plan prior to the date that is the earlier of the date on which consolidation is completed according to the plan or the date that is 2 years after the plan is approved.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Characteristics of raw water sources; specific treatment technique; notice to Administrator, reasons for variance; compliance, enforcement; approval or revision of schedules and revocation of variances; review of variances and schedules; publication in Federal Register, notice and results of review; notice to State; considerations respecting abuse of discretion in granting variances or failing to prescribe schedules; State corrective action; authority of Administrator in a State without primary enforcement responsibility; alternative treatment techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, variances from national primary drinking water regulations may be granted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) A State which has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems may grant one or more variances from an applicable national primary drinking water regulation to one or more public water systems within its jurisdiction which, because of characteristics of the raw water sources which are reasonably available to the systems, cannot meet the requirements respecting the maximum contaminant levels of such drinking water regulation. A variance may be issued to a system on condition that the system install the best technology, treatment techniques, or other means, which the Administrator finds are available (taking costs into consideration), and based upon an evaluation satisfactory to the State that indicates that alternative sources of water are not reasonably available to the system. The Administrator shall propose and promulgate his finding of the best available technology, treatment techniques or other means available for each contaminant for purposes of this subsection at the time he proposes and promulgates a maximum contaminant level for each such contaminant. The Administrator's finding of best available technology, treatment techniques or other means for purposes of this subsection may vary depending on the number of persons served by the system or for other physical conditions related to engineering feasibility and costs of compliance with maximum contaminant levels as considered appropriate by the <!-- PDFPage:885 -->Administrator. Before a State may grant a variance under this subparagraph, the State must find that the variance will not result in an unreasonable risk to health. If a State grants a public water system a variance under this subparagraph, the State shall prescribe at the the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300g-4_1_target" name="300g-4_1">1</a></sup> time the variance is granted, a schedule for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) compliance (including increments of progress) by the public water system with each containment level requirement with respect to which the variance was granted, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) implementation by the public water system of such additional control measures as the State may require for each contaminant, subject to such contaminant level requirement, during the period ending on the date compliance with such requirement is required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Before a schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to this subparagraph may take effect, the State shall provide notice and opportunity for a public hearing on the schedule. A notice given pursuant to the preceding sentence may cover the prescribing of more than one such schedule and a hearing held pursuant to such notice shall include each of the schedules covered by the notice. A schedule prescribed pursuant to this subparagraph for a public water system granted a variance shall require compliance by the system with each contaminant level requirement with respect to which the variance was granted as expeditiously as practicable (as the State may reasonably determine).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) A State which has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems may grant to one or more public water systems within its jurisdiction one or more variances from any provision of the national primary drinking water regulation which requires the use of a specified treatment technique with respect to a contaminant if the public water system applying for the variance demonstrates to the satisfaction of the State that such treatment technique is not necessary to protect the health of persons because of the nature of the raw water source of such system. A variance granted under this subparagraph shall be conditioned on such monitoring and other requirements as the Administrator may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Before a variance proposed to be granted by a State under subparagraph (A) or (B) may take effect, such State shall provide notice and opportunity for public hearing on the proposed variance. A notice given pursuant to the preceding sentence may cover the granting of more than one variance and a hearing held pursuant to such notice shall include each of the variances covered by the notice. The State shall promptly notify the Administrator of all variances granted by it. Such notification shall contain the reason for the variance (and in the case of a variance under subparagraph (A), the basis for the finding required by that subparagraph before the granting of the variance) and documentation of the need for the variance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Each public water system's variance granted by a State under subparagraph (A) shall be conditioned by the State upon compliance by the public water system with the schedule prescribed by the State pursuant to that subparagraph. The requirements of each schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to that subparagraph shall be enforceable by the State under its laws. Any requirement of a schedule on which a variance granted under that subparagraph is conditioned may be enforced under section 300g&ndash;3 of this title as if such requirement was part of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Each schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be deemed approved by the Administrator unless the variance for which it was prescribed is revoked by the Administrator under subparagraph (G) or the schedule is revised by the Administrator under such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Not later than 18 months after the effective date of the interim national primary drinking water regulations the Administrator shall complete a comprehensive review of the variances granted under subparagraph (A) (and schedules prescribed pursuant thereto) and under subparagraph (B) by the States during the one-year period beginning on such effective date. The Administrator shall conduct such subsequent reviews of variances and schedules as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, but each subsequent review shall be completed within each 3-year period following the completion of the first review under this subparagraph. Before conducting any review under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall publish notice of the proposed review in the Federal Register. Such notice shall (i) provide information respecting the location of data and other information respecting the variances to be reviewed (including data and other information concerning new scientific matters bearing on such variances), and (ii) advise of the opportunity to submit comments on the variances reviewed and on the need for continuing them. Upon completion of any such review, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the results of his review together with findings responsive to comments submitted in connection with such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G)(i) If the Administrator finds that a State has, in a substantial number of instances, abused its discretion in granting variances under subparagraph (A) or (B) or that in a substantial number of cases the State has failed to prescribe schedules in accordance with subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall notify the State of his findings. In determining if a State has abused its discretion in granting variances in a substantial number of instances, the Administrator shall consider the number of persons who are affected by the variances and if the requirements applicable to the granting of the variances were complied with. A notice under this clause shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) identify each public water system with respect to which the finding was made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) specify the reasons for the finding, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) as appropriate, propose revocations of specific variances or propose revised sched<!-- PDFPage:886 -->ules or other requirements for specific public water systems granted variances, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The Administrator shall provide reasonable notice and public hearing on the provisions of each notice given pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph. After a hearing on a notice pursuant to such clause, the Administrator shall (I) rescind the finding for which the notice was given and promptly notify the State of such rescission, or (II) promulgate (with such modifications as he deems appropriate) such variance revocations and revised schedules or other requirements proposed in such notice as he deems appropriate. Not later than 180 days after the date a notice is given pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph, the Administrator shall complete the hearing on the notice and take the action required by the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) If a State is notified under clause (i) of this subparagraph of a finding of the Administrator made with respect to a variance granted a public water system within that State or to a schedule or other requirement for a variance and if, before a revocation of such variance or a revision of such schedule or other requirement promulgated by the Administrator takes effect, the State takes corrective action with respect to such variance or schedule or other requirement which the Administrator determines makes his finding inapplicable to such variance or schedule or other requirement, the Administrator shall rescind the application of his finding to that variance on schedule or other requirement. No variance revocation or revised schedule or other requirement may take effect before the expiration of 90 days following the date of the notice in which the revocation or revised schedule or other requirement was proposed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If a State does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems, the Administrator shall have the same authority to grant variances in such State as the State would have under paragraph (1) if it had primary enforcement responsibility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Administrator may grant a variance from any treatment technique requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation upon a showing by any person that an alternative treatment technique not included in such requirement is at least as efficient in lowering the level of the contaminant with respect to which such requirement was prescribed. A variance under this paragraph shall be conditioned on the use of the alternative treatment technique which is the basis of the variance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enforcement of schedule or other requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any schedule or other requirement on which a variance granted under paragraph (1)(B) or (2) of subsection (a) of this section is conditioned may be enforced under section 300g&ndash;3 of this title as if such schedule or other requirement was part of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applications for variances; regulations: reasonable time for acting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an application for a variance under subsection (a) of this section is made, the State receiving the application or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall act upon such application within a reasonable period (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Administrator) after the date of its submission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Treatment technique requirement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;treatment technique requirement&rdquo; means a requirement in a national primary drinking water regulation which specifies for a contaminant (in accordance with section 300f(1)(C)(ii) of this title) each treatment technique known to the Administrator which leads to a reduction in the level of such contaminant sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 300g&ndash;1(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Small system variances</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title (or the Administrator in nonprimacy States) may grant a variance under this subsection for compliance with a requirement specifying a maximum contaminant level or treatment technique contained in a national primary drinking water regulation to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) public water systems serving 3,300 or fewer persons; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with the approval of the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (9), public water systems serving more than 3,300 persons but fewer than 10,000 persons,</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Availability of variances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A public water system may receive a variance pursuant to paragraph (1), if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Administrator has identified a variance technology under section 300g&ndash;1(b)(15) of this title that is applicable to the size and source water quality conditions of the public water system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the public water system installs, operates, and maintains, in accordance with guidance or regulations issued by the Administrator, such treatment technology, treatment technique, or other means; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the State in which the system is located determines that the conditions of paragraph (3) are met.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Conditions for granting variances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A variance under this subsection shall be available only to a system&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that cannot afford to comply, in accordance with affordability criteria established by the Administrator (or the State in the case of a State that has primary enforcement responsibility under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title), with a national primary drinking water regulation, including compliance through&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for which the Administrator (or the State in the case of a State that has primary enforcement responsibility under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title) determines that the terms of the variance ensure adequate protection of human health, considering the quality of the source water for the system and the removal efficiencies and expected useful life of the treatment technology required by the variance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Compliance schedules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A variance granted under this subsection shall require compliance with the conditions of the variance not later than 3 years after the date on which the variance is granted, except that the Administrator (or the State in the case of a State that has primary enforcement responsibility under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title) may allow up to 2 additional years to comply with a variance technology, secure an alternative source of water, restructure or consolidate if the Administrator (or the State) determines that additional time is necessary for capital improvements, or to allow for financial assistance provided pursuant to section 300j&ndash;12 of this title or any other Federal or State program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Duration of variances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator (or the State in the case of a State that has primary enforcement responsibility under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title) shall review each variance granted under this subsection not less often than every 5 years after the compliance date established in the variance to determine whether the system remains eligible for the variance and is conforming to each condition of the variance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Ineligibility for variances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A variance shall not be available under this subsection for&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 2 years after August 6, 1996, and in consultation with the States, the Administrator shall promulgate regulations for variances to be granted under this subsection. The regulations shall, at a minimum, specify&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) procedures to be used by the Administrator or a State to grant or deny variances, including requirements for notifying the Administrator and consumers of the public water system that a variance is proposed to be granted (including information regarding the contaminant and variance) and requirements for a public hearing on the variance before the variance is granted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) requirements for the installation and proper operation of variance technology that is identified (pursuant to section 300g&ndash;1(b)(15) of this title) for small systems and the financial and technical capability to operate the treatment system, including operator training and certification;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Review by the Administrator</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall periodically review the program of each State that has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title with respect to variances to determine whether the variances granted by the State comply with the requirements of this subsection. With respect to affordability, the determination of the Administrator shall be limited to whether the variances granted by the State comply with the affordability criteria developed by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Notice and publication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Administrator determines that variances granted by a State are not in compliance with affordability criteria developed by the State and the requirements of this subsection, the Administrator shall notify the State in writing of the deficiencies and make public the determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Approval of variances</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State proposing to grant a variance under this subsection to a public water system serving more than 3,300 and fewer than 10,000 persons shall submit the variance to the Administrator for review and approval prior to the issuance of the variance.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(10) Objections to variances</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) By the Administrator</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator may review and object to any variance proposed to be granted by a <!-- PDFPage:888 -->State, if the objection is communicated to the State not later than 90 days after the State proposes to grant the variance. If the Administrator objects to the granting of a variance, the Administrator shall notify the State in writing of each basis for the objection and propose a modification to the variance to resolve the concerns of the Administrator. The State shall make the recommended modification or respond in writing to each objection. If the State issues the variance without resolving the concerns of the Administrator, the Administrator may overturn the State decision to grant the variance if the Administrator determines that the State decision does not comply with this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Petition by consumers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Not later than 30 days after a State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title proposes to grant a variance for a public water system, any person served by the system may petition the Administrator to object to the granting of a variance. The Administrator shall respond to the petition and determine whether to object to the variance under subparagraph (A) not later than 60 days after the receipt of the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No variance shall be granted by a State until the later of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) 90 days after the State proposes to grant a variance.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;300g&ndash;5. Exemptions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requisite findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State which has primary enforcement responsibility may exempt any public water system within the State's jurisdiction from any requirement respecting a maximum contaminant level or any treatment technique requirement, or from both, of an applicable national primary drinking water regulation upon a finding that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) due to compelling factors (which may include economic factors, including qualification of the public water system as a system serving a disadvantaged community pursuant to section 300j&ndash;12(d) of this title), the public water system is unable to comply with such contaminant level or treatment technique requirement, or to implement measures to develop an alternative source of water supply,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the public water system was in operation on the effective date of such contaminant level or treatment technique requirement, or, for a system that was not in operation by that date, only if no reasonable alternative source of drinking water is available to such new system,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the granting of the exemption will not result in an unreasonable risk to health;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300g-5_1_target" name="300g-5_1">1</a></sup> and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) management or restructuring changes (or both) cannot reasonably be made that will result in compliance with this subchapter or, if compliance cannot be achieved, improve the quality of the drinking water.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance schedule and implementation of control measures; notice and hearing; dates for compliance with schedule; compliance, enforcement; approval or revision of schedules and revocation of exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a State grants a public water system an exemption under subsection (a) of this section, the State shall prescribe, at the time the exemption is granted, a schedule for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) compliance (including increments of progress or measures to develop an alternative source of water supply) by the public water system with each contaminant level requirement or treatment technique requirement with respect to which the exemption was granted, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) implementation by the public water system of such control measures as the State may require for each contaminant, subject to such contaminant level requirement or treatment technique requirement, during the period ending on the date compliance with such requirement is required.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Before a schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to this subsection may take effect, the State shall provide notice and opportunity for a public hearing on the schedule. A notice given pursuant to the preceding sentence may cover the prescribing of more than one such schedule and a hearing held pursuant to such notice shall include each of the schedules covered by the notice.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:889 --><p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A schedule prescribed pursuant to this subsection for a public water system granted an exemption under subsection (a) of this section shall require compliance by the system with each contaminant level and treatment technique requirement with respect to which the exemption was granted as expeditiously as practicable (as the State may reasonably determine) but not later than 3 years after the otherwise applicable compliance date established in section 300g&ndash;1(b)(10) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No exemption shall be granted unless the public water system establishes that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the system cannot meet the standard without capital improvements which cannot be completed prior to the date established pursuant to section 300g&ndash;1(b)(10) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in the case of a system which needs financial assistance for the necessary improvements, the system has entered into an agreement to obtain such financial assistance or assistance pursuant to section 300j&ndash;12 of this title, or any other Federal or State program is reasonably likely to be available within the period of the exemption; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the system has entered into an enforceable agreement to become a part of a regional public water system; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the system is taking all practicable steps to meet the standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of a system which does not serve more than a population of 3,300 and which needs financial assistance for the necessary improvements, an exemption granted under clause (i) or (ii) of subparagraph (B) may be renewed for one or more additional 2-year periods, but not to exceed a total of 6 years, if the system establishes that it is taking all practicable steps to meet the requirements of subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) <cap-smallcap>Limitation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A public water system may not receive an exemption under this section if the system was granted a variance under section 300g&ndash;4(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each public water system's exemption granted by a State under subsection (a) of this section shall be conditioned by the State upon compliance by the public water system with the schedule prescribed by the State pursuant to this subsection. The requirements of each schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to this subsection shall be enforceable by the State under its laws. Any requirement of a schedule on which an exemption granted under this section is conditioned may be enforced under section 300g&ndash;3 of this title as if such requirement was part of a national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each schedule prescribed by a State pursuant to this subsection shall be deemed approved by the Administrator unless the exemption for which it was prescribed is revoked by the Administrator under subsection (d)(2) of this section or the schedule is revised by the Administrator under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice to Administrator; reasons for exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State which grants an exemption under subsection (a) of this section shall promptly notify the Administrator of the granting of such exemption. Such notification shall contain the reasons for the exemption (including the basis for the finding required by subsection (a)(3) of this section before the exemption may be granted) and document the need for the exemption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of exemptions and schedules; publication in Federal Register, notice and results of review; notice to State; considerations respecting abuse of discretion in granting exemptions or failing to prescribe schedules; State corrective action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 18 months after the effective date of the interim national primary drinking water regulations the Administrator shall complete a comprehensive review of the exemptions granted (and schedules prescribed pursuant thereto) by the States during the one-year period beginning on such effective date. The Administrator shall conduct such subsequent reviews of exemptions and schedules as he deems necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, but each subsequent review shall be completed within each 3-year period following the completion of the first review under this subparagraph. Before conducting any review under this subparagraph, the Administrator shall publish notice of the proposed review in the Federal Register. Such notice shall (A) provide information respecting the location of data and other information respecting the exemptions to be reviewed (including data and other information concerning new scientific matters bearing on such exemptions), and (B) advise of the opportunity to submit comments on the exemptions reviewed and on the need for continuing them. Upon completion of any such review, the Administrator shall publish in the Federal Register the results of his review, together with findings responsive to comments submitted in connection with such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the Administrator finds that a State has, in a substantial number of instances, abused its discretion in granting exemptions under subsection (a) of this section or failed to prescribe schedules in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the Administrator shall notify the State of his findings. In determining if a State has abused its discretion in granting exemptions in a substantial number of instances, the Administrator shall consider the number of persons who are affected by the exemptions and if the requirements applicable to the granting of the exemptions were complied with. A notice under this subparagraph shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) identify each exempt public water system with respect to which the finding was made,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) specify the reasons for the finding, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) as appropriate, propose revocations of specific exemptions or propose revised schedules for specific exempt public water systems, or both.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Administrator shall provide reasonable notice and public hearing on the provisions of each notice given pursuant to subparagraph (A). After a hearing on notice pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall (i) rescind the finding for which the notice was given and promptly notify the State of such rescission, or (ii) promulgate (with such modifications as he deems appropriate) such exemption revocations and revised schedules proposed in such <!-- PDFPage:890 -->notice as he deems appropriate. Not later than 180 days after the date a notice is given pursuant to subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall complete the hearing on the notice and take the action required by the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a State is notified under subparagraph (A) of a finding of the Administrator made with respect to an exemption granted a public water system within that State or to a schedule prescribed pursuant to such an exemption and if before a revocation of such exemption or a revision of such schedule promulgated by the Administrator takes effect the State takes corrective action with respect to such exemption or schedule which the Administrator determines makes his finding inapplicable to such exemption or schedule, the Administrator shall rescind the application of his finding to that exemption or schedule. No exemption revocation or revised schedule may take effect before the expiration of 90 days following the date of the notice in which the revocation or revised schedule was proposed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Treatment technique requirement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;treatment technique requirement&rdquo; means a requirement in a national primary drinking water regulation which specifies for a contaminant (in accordance with section 300f(1)(C)(ii) of this title) each treatment technique known to the Administrator which leads to a reduction in the level of such contaminant sufficient to satisfy the requirements of section 300g&ndash;1(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authority of Administrator in a State without primary enforcement responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State does not have primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems, the Administrator shall have the same authority to exempt public water systems in such State from maximum contaminant level requirements and treatment technique requirements under the same conditions and in the same manner as the State would be authorized to grant exemptions under this section if it had primary enforcement responsibility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Applications for exemptions; regulations; reasonable time for acting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an application for an exemption under this section is made, the State receiving the application or the Administrator, as the case may be, shall act upon such application within a reasonable period (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Administrator) after the date of its submission.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;300g&ndash;7. Monitoring of contaminants</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Interim monitoring relief authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems may modify the monitoring requirements for any regulated or unregulated contaminants for which monitoring is required other than microbial contaminants (or indicators thereof), disinfectants and disinfection byproducts or corrosion byproducts for an interim period to provide that any public water system serving 10,000 persons or fewer shall not be required to conduct additional quarterly monitoring during an interim relief period for such contaminants if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) monitoring, conducted at the beginning of the period for the contaminant concerned and certified to the State by the public water system, fails to detect the presence of the contaminant in the ground or surface water supplying the public water system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the State, considering the hydrogeology of the area and other relevant factors, determines in writing that the contaminant is unlikely to be detected by further monitoring during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination; timing of monitoring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The interim relief period referred to in paragraph (1) shall terminate when permanent monitoring relief is adopted and approved for such State, or at the end of 36 months after August 6, 1996, whichever comes first. In order to serve as a basis for interim relief, the monitoring conducted at the beginning of the period must occur at the time determined by the State to be the time of the public water system's greatest vulnerability to the contaminant concerned in the relevant ground or surface water, taking into account in the case of pesticides the time of application of the pesticide for the source water area and the travel time for the pesticide to reach such waters and taking into account, in the case of other contaminants, seasonality of precipitation and contaminant travel time.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Permanent monitoring relief authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems under this subchapter and having an approved source water assessment program may adopt, in accordance with guidance published by the Ad<!-- PDFPage:893 -->ministrator, tailored alternative monitoring requirements for public water systems in such State (as an alternative to the monitoring requirements for chemical contaminants set forth in the applicable national primary drinking water regulations) where the State concludes that (based on data available at the time of adoption concerning susceptibility, use, occurrence, or wellhead protection, or from the State's drinking water source water assessment program) such alternative monitoring would provide assurance that it complies with the Administrator's guidelines. The State program must be adequate to assure compliance with, and enforcement of, applicable national primary drinking water regulations. Alternative monitoring shall not apply to regulated microbiological contaminants (or indicators thereof), disinfectants and disinfection byproducts, or corrosion byproducts. The preceding sentence is not intended to limit other authority of the Administrator under other provisions of this subchapter to grant monitoring flexibility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Guidelines</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall issue, after notice and comment and at the same time as guidelines are issued for source water assessment under section 300j&ndash;13 of this title, guidelines for States to follow in proposing alternative monitoring requirements under paragraph (1) for chemical contaminants. The Administrator shall publish such guidelines in the Federal Register. The guidelines shall assure that the public health will be protected from drinking water contamination. The guidelines shall require that a State alternative monitoring program apply on a contaminant-by-contaminant basis and that, to be eligible for such alternative monitoring program, a public water system must show the State that the contaminant is not present in the drinking water supply or, if present, it is reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant level.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), the phrase &ldquo;reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant level&rdquo; means that, although contaminants have been detected in a water supply, the State has sufficient knowledge of the contamination source and extent of contamination to predict that the maximum contaminant level will not be exceeded. In determining that a contaminant is reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant level, States shall consider the quality and completeness of data, the length of time covered and the volatility or stability of monitoring results during that time, and the proximity of such results to the maximum contaminant level. Wide variations in the analytical results, or analytical results close to the maximum contaminant level, shall not be considered to be reliably and consistently below the maximum contaminant level.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effect of detection of contaminants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The guidelines issued by the Administrator under paragraph (2) shall require that if, after the monitoring program is in effect and operating, a contaminant covered by the alternative monitoring program is detected at levels at or above the maximum contaminant level or is no longer reliably or consistently below the maximum contaminant level, the public water system must either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) demonstrate that the contamination source has been removed or that other action has been taken to eliminate the contamination problem; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) test for the detected contaminant pursuant to the applicable national primary drinking water regulation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) States not exercising primary enforcement responsibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Governor of any State not exercising primary enforcement responsibility under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title on August 6, 1996, may submit to the Administrator a request that the Administrator modify the monitoring requirements established by the Administrator and applicable to public water systems in that State. After consultation with the Governor, the Administrator shall modify the requirements for public water systems in that State if the request of the Governor is in accordance with each of the requirements of this subsection that apply to alternative monitoring requirements established by States that have primary enforcement responsibility. A decision by the Administrator to approve a request under this clause shall be for a period of 3 years and may subsequently be extended for periods of 5 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Treatment as NPDWR</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All monitoring relief granted by a State to a public water system for a regulated contaminant under subsection (a) or (b) of this section shall be treated as part of the national primary drinking water regulation for that contaminant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Other monitoring relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the authority of the States under applicable national primary drinking water regulations to alter monitoring requirements through waivers or other existing authorities. The Administrator shall periodically review and, as appropriate, revise such authorities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 30 months after August 6, 1996, and in cooperation with the States, the Administrator shall publish guidelines in the Federal Register, after notice and opportunity for comment from interested persons, including States and public water systems, specifying minimum standards for certification (and recertification) of the operators of community and nontransient noncommunity public water systems. Such guidelines shall take into account existing State <!-- PDFPage:894 -->programs, the complexity of the system, and other factors aimed at providing an effective program at reasonable cost to States and public water systems, taking into account the size of the system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning 2 years after the date on which the Administrator publishes guidelines under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall withhold 20 percent of the funds a State is otherwise entitled to receive under section 300j&ndash;12 of this title unless the State has adopted and is implementing a program for the certification of operators of community and nontransient noncommunity public water systems that meets the requirements of the guidelines published pursuant to subsection (a) of this section or that has been submitted in compliance with subsection (c) of this section and that has not been disapproved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Existing programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any State exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems or any other State which has an operator certification program, the guidelines under subsection (a) of this section shall allow the State to enforce such program in lieu of the guidelines under subsection (a) of this section if the State submits the program to the Administrator within 18 months after the publication of the guidelines unless the Administrator determines (within 9 months after the State submits the program to the Administrator) that such program is not substantially equivalent to such guidelines. In making this determination, an existing State program shall be presumed to be substantially equivalent to the guidelines, notwithstanding program differences, based on the size of systems or the quality of source water, providing the State program meets the overall public health objectives of the guidelines. If disapproved, the program may be resubmitted within 6 months after receipt of notice of disapproval.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Expense reimbursement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall provide reimbursement for the costs of training, including an appropriate per diem for unsalaried operators, and certification for persons operating systems serving 3,300 persons or fewer that are required to undergo training pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The reimbursement shall be provided through grants to States with each State receiving an amount sufficient to cover the reasonable costs for training all such operators in the State, as determined by the Administrator, to the extent required by this section. Grants received by a State pursuant to this paragraph shall first be used to provide reimbursement for training and certification costs of persons operating systems serving 3,300 persons or fewer. If a State has reimbursed all such costs, the State may, after notice to the Administrator, use any remaining funds from the grant for any of the other purposes authorized for grants under section 300j&ndash;12 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There are authorized to be appropriated to the Administrator to provide grants for reimbursement under this section $30,000,000 for each of fiscal years 1997 through 2003.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reservation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the appropriation made pursuant to paragraph (3) for any fiscal year is not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (1), the Administrator shall, prior to any other allocation or reservation, reserve such sums as necessary from the funds appropriated pursuant to section 300j&ndash;12(m) of this title to provide reimbursement for the training and certification costs mandated by this subsection.</p>

Within 180 days after publication of such proposed regulations, he shall promulgate such regulations with such modifications as he deems appropriate. Any regulation under this subsection may be amended from time to time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any regulation under this section shall be proposed and promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title 5 (relating to rulemaking), except that the Administrator shall provide opportunity for public hearing prior to promulgation of such regulations. In proposing and promulgating regulations under this section the Administrator shall consult with the Secretary, the National Drinking Water Advisory Council, and other appropriate Federal entities and with interested State entities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Minimum requirements; restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Regulations under subsection (a) of this section for State underground injection programs shall contain minimum requirements for effective programs to prevent underground injection which endangers drinking water sources within the meaning of subsection (d)(2) of this section. Such regulations shall require that a State program, in order to be approved under section 300h&ndash;1 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall prohibit, effective on the date on which the applicable underground injection control program takes effect, any underground injection in such State which is not authorized <!-- PDFPage:897 -->by a permit issued by the State (except that the regulations may permit a State to authorize underground injection by rule);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall require (i) in the case of a program which provides for authorization of underground injection by permit, that the applicant for the permit to inject must satisfy the State that the underground injection will not endanger drinking water sources, and (ii) in the case of a program which provides for such an authorization by rule, that no rule may be promulgated which authorizes any underground injection which endangers drinking water sources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall include inspection, monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) shall apply (i) as prescribed by section 300j&ndash;6(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300h_1_target" name="300h_1">1</a></sup> of this title, to underground injections by Federal agencies, and (ii) to underground injections by any other person whether or not occurring on property owned or leased by the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Regulations of the Administrator under this section for State underground injection control programs may not prescribe requirements which interfere with or impede&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the underground injection of brine or other fluids which are brought to the surface in connection with oil or natural gas production or natural gas storage operations, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless such requirements are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by such injection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The regulations of the Administrator under this section shall permit or provide for consideration of varying geologic, hydrological, or historical conditions in different States and in different areas within a State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In prescribing regulations under this section the Administrator shall, to the extent feasible, avoid promulgation of requirements which would unnecessarily disrupt State underground injection control programs which are in effect and being enforced in a substantial number of States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For the purpose of this subparagraph, a regulation prescribed by the Administrator under this section shall be deemed to disrupt a State underground injection control program only if it would be infeasible to comply with both such regulation and the State underground injection control program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For the purpose of this subparagraph, a regulation prescribed by the Administrator under this section shall be deemed unnecessary only if, without such regulation, underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by an underground injection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing in this section shall be construed to alter or affect the duty to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by any underground injection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Temporary permits; notice and hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator may, upon application of the Governor of a State which authorizes underground injection by means of permits, authorize such State to issue (without regard to subsection (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section) temporary permits for underground injection which may be effective until the, expiration of four years after December 16, 1974, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Administrator finds that the State has demonstrated that it is unable and could not reasonably have been able to process all permit applications within the time available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Administrator determines the adverse effect on the environment of such temporary permits is not unwarranted;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such temporary permits will be issued only with respect to injection wells in operation on the date on which such State's permit program approved under this part first takes effect and for which there was inadequate time to process its permit application; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the Administrator determines the temporary permits require the use of adequate safeguards established by rules adopted by him.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator may, upon application of the Governor of a State which authorizes underground injection by means of permits, authorize such State to issue (without regard to subsection (b)(1)(B)(i) of this section), but after reasonable notice and hearing, one or more temporary permits each of which is applicable to a particular injection well and to the underground injection of a particular fluid and which may be effective until the expiration of four years after December 16, 1974, if the State finds, on the record of such hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that technology (or other means) to permit safe injection of the fluid in accordance with the applicable underground injection control program is not generally available (taking costs into consideration);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that injection of the fluid would be less harmful to health than the use of other available means of disposing of waste or producing the desired product; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that available technology or other means have been employed (and will be employed) to reduce the volume and toxicity of the fluid and to minimize the potentially adverse effect of the injection on the public health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Underground injection&rdquo; defined; underground injection endangerment of drinking water sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) has adopted after reasonable notice and public hearings, and will implement, an underground injection control program which meets the requirements of regulations in effect under section 300h of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) will keep such records and make such reports with respect to its activities under its underground injection control program as the Administrator may require by regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Administrator may, for good cause, extend the date for submission of an application by any State under this subparagraph for a period not to exceed an additional 270 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Within 270 days of any amendment of a regulation under section 300h of this title revising or adding any requirement respecting State underground injection control programs, each State listed under subsection (a) of this section shall submit (in such form and manner as the Administrator may require) a notice to the Administrator containing a showing satisfactory to him that the State underground injection control program meets the revised or added requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Within ninety days after the State's application under paragraph (1)(A) or notice under paragraph (1)(B) and after reasonable opportunity for presentation of views, the Administrator shall by rule either approve, disapprove, or approve in part and disapprove in part, the State's underground injection control program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Administrator approves the State's program under paragraph (2), the State shall have primary enforcement responsibility for underground water sources until such time as the Administrator determines, by rule, that such State no longer meets the requirements of clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (1)(A) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Before promulgating any rule under paragraph (2) or (3) of this subsection, the Administrator shall provide opportunity for public hearing respecting such rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Program by Administrator for State without primary enforcement responsibility; restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator disapproves a State's program (or part thereof) under subsection (b)(2) of this section, if the Administrator determines under subsection (b)(3) of this section that a State no longer meets the requirements of clause (i) or (ii) of subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section, or if a State fails to submit an application or notice before the date of expiration of the period specified in subsection (b)(1) of this section, the Administrator shall by regulation within 90 days after the date of such disapproval, determination, or expiration (as the case may be) prescribe (and may from time to time by regulation revise) a program applicable to such State meeting the requirements of section 300h(b) of this title. Such program may not include requirements which interfere with or impede&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the underground injection of brine or other fluids which are brought to the surface in connection with oil or natural gas production or natural gas storage operations, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any underground injection for the secondary or tertiary recovery of oil or natural gas,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless such requirements are essential to assure that underground sources of drinking water will not be endangered by such injection. Such program shall apply in such State to the extent <!-- PDFPage:899 -->that a program adopted by such State which the Administrator determines meets such requirements is not in effect. Before promulgating any regulation under this section, the Administrator shall provide opportunity for public hearing respecting such regulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Applicable underground injection control program&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;applicable underground injection control program&rdquo; with respect to a State means the program (or most recent amendment thereof) (1) which has been adopted by the State and which has been approved under subsection (b) of this section, or (2) which has been prescribed by the Administrator under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Primary enforcement responsibility by Indian Tribe</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An Indian Tribe may assume primary enforcement responsibility for underground injection control under this section consistent with such regulations as the Administrator has prescribed pursuant to this part and section 300j&ndash;11 of this title. The area over which such Indian Tribe exercises governmental jurisdiction need not have been listed under subsection (a) of this section, and such Tribe need not submit an application to assume primary enforcement responsibility within the 270-day deadline noted in subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section. Until an Indian Tribe assumes primary enforcement responsibility, the currently applicable underground injection control program shall continue to apply. If an applicable underground injection control program does not exist for an Indian Tribe, the Administrator shall prescribe such a program pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, and consistent with section 300h(b) of this title, within 270 days after June 19, 1986, unless an Indian Tribe first obtains approval to assume primary enforcement responsibility for underground injection control.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In assessing any civil penalty under this subsection, the Administrator shall take into account appropriate factors, including (i) the seriousness of the violation; (ii) the economic benefit (if any) resulting from the violation; (iii) any history of such violations; (iv) any good-faith efforts to comply with the applicable requirements; (v) the economic impact of the penalty on the violator; and (vi) such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Any violation with respect to which the Administrator has commenced and is diligently prosecuting an action, or has issued an order under this subsection assessing a penalty, shall not be subject to an action under subsection (b) of this section or section 300h&ndash;3(c) or 300j&ndash;8 of this title, except that the foregoing limitation on civil actions under section 300j&ndash;8 of this title shall not apply with respect to any violation for which&mdash;</p>

Appellant shall simultaneously send a copy of the appeal by certified mail to the Administrator and to the Attorney General. The Administrator shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the record on which such order was imposed. The district court shall not set aside or remand such order unless there is not substantial evidence on the record, taken as a whole, to support the finding of a violation or, unless the Administrator's assessment of penalty or requirement for compliance constitutes an abuse of discretion. The district court shall not impose additional civil penalties for the same violation unless the Administrator's assessment of a penalty constitutes an abuse of discretion. Notwithstanding section 300j&ndash;7(a)(2) of this title, any order issued under paragraph (3) shall be subject to judicial review exclusively under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) after the order becomes effective under paragraph (3), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) after a court, in an action brought under paragraph (6), has entered a final judgment in favor of the Administrator,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Necessity for well operation permit; designation of one aquifer areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any person may petition the Administrator to have an area of a State (or States) designated as an area in which no new underground injection well may be operated during the period beginning on the date of the designation and ending on the date on which the applicable underground injection control program covering such area takes effect unless a permit for the operation of such well has been issued by the Administrator under subsection (b) of this section. The Administrator may so designate an area within a State if he finds that the area has one aquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon receipt of a petition under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Administrator shall publish it in the Federal Register and shall provide an opportunity to interested persons to submit written data, views, or arguments thereon. Not later than the 30th day following the date of the publication of a petition under this paragraph in the Federal Register, the Administrator shall either make the designation for which the petition is submitted or deny the petition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Well operation permits; publication in Federal Register; notice and hearing; issuance or denial; conditions for issuance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the period beginning on the date an area is designated under subsection (a) of this section and ending on the date the applicable underground injection control program covering such area takes effect, no new underground injection well may be operated in such area unless the Administrator has issued a permit for such operation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person may petition the Administrator for the issuance of a permit for the operation of such a well in such an area. A petition submitted under this paragraph shall be submitted in such manner and contain such information as the Administrator may require by regulation. Upon receipt of such a petition, the Administrator shall publish it in the Federal Register. The Administrator shall give notice of any proceeding on a petition and shall provide opportunity for agency hearing. The Administrator shall act upon such petition on the record of any hearing held pursuant to the preceding sentence respecting such petition. Within 120 days of the publication in the Federal Register of a petition submitted under this paragraph, the Administrator shall either issue the permit for which the petition was submitted or shall deny its issuance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator may issue a permit for the operation of a new underground injection well in an area designated under subsection (a) of this section only, if he finds that the operation of such well will not cause contamination of the aquifer of such area so as to create a significant hazard to public health. The Administrator may condition the issuance of such a permit upon the use of such control measures in connection with the operation of such well, for which the permit is to be issued, as he deems necessary to assure that the operation of the well will not contaminate the aquifer of the designated area in which the well is located so as to create a significant hazard to public health.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Civil penalties; separate violations; penalties for willful violations; temporary restraining order or injunction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person who operates a new underground injection well in violation of subsection (b) of this section, (1) shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $5,000 for each day in which such violation occurs, or (2) if such violation is willful, such person may, in lieu of the civil penalty authorized by clause (1), be fined not more than $10,000 for each day in which such violation occurs. If the Administrator has reason to believe that any person is violating or will violate subsection (b) of this section, he may petition the United States district court to issue a temporary restraining order or injunction (including a mandatory injunction) to enforce such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;New underground injection well&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;new underground injection well&rdquo; means an underground injection well whose operation was not approved by appropriate State and Federal agencies before December 16, 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Areas with one aquifer; publication in Federal Register; commitments for Federal financial assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator determines, on his own initiative or upon petition, that an area has an aquifer which is the sole or principal drinking water source for the area and which, if contaminated, would create a significant hazard to public health, he shall publish notice of that deter<!-- PDFPage:902 -->mination in the Federal Register. After the publication of any such notice, no commitment for Federal financial assistance (through a grant, contract, loan guarantee, or otherwise) may be entered into for any project which the Administrator determines may contaminate such aquifer through a recharge zone so as to create a significant hazard to public health, but a commitment for Federal financial assistance may, if authorized under another provision of law, be entered into to plan or design the project to assure that it will not so contaminate the aquifer.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;300h&ndash;7. State programs to establish wellhead protection areas</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Governor or Governor's designee of each State shall, within 3 years of June 19, 1986, adopt and submit to the Administrator a State program to protect wellhead areas within their jurisdiction from contaminants which may have any adverse effect on the health of persons. Each State program under this section shall, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) specify the duties of State agencies, local governmental entities, and public water supply systems with respect to the development and implementation of programs required by this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for each wellhead, determine the wellhead protection area as defined in subsection (e) of this section based on all reasonably available hydrogeologic information on ground water flow, recharge and discharge and other information the State deems necessary to adequately determine the wellhead protection area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) identify within each wellhead protection area all potential anthropogenic sources of contaminants which may have any adverse effect on the health of persons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) describe a program that contains, as appropriate, technical assistance, financial assistance, implementation of control measures, education, training, and demonstration projects to protect the water supply within wellhead protection areas from such contaminants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) include contingency plans for the location and provision of alternate drinking water supplies for each public water system in the event of well or wellfield contamination by such contaminants; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) include a requirement that consideration be given to all potential sources of such contaminants within the expected wellhead area of a new water well which serves a public water supply system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Public participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the maximum extent possible, each State shall establish procedures, including but not limited to the establishment of technical and citizens&rsquo; advisory committees, to encourage the public to participate in developing the protection program for wellhead areas and source water assessment programs under section 300j&ndash;13 of this title. Such procedures shall include notice and opportunity for public hearing on the State program before it is submitted to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disapproval</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If, in the judgment of the Administrator, a State program or portion thereof under subsection (a) of this section is not adequate to protect public water systems as required by subsection (a) of this section or a State program under section 300j&ndash;13 of this title or section 300g&ndash;7(b) of this title does not meet the applicable requirements of section 300j&ndash;13 of this title or section 300g&ndash;7(b) of this title, the Administrator shall disapprove such program or portion thereof. A State program developed pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be deemed to be adequate unless the Administrator determines, within 9 months of the receipt of a State program, that such program (or portion thereof) is inadequate for the purpose of protecting public water systems as required by this section from contaminants that may have any adverse effect on the health of persons. A State program developed pursuant to section 300j&ndash;13 of this title or section 300g&ndash;7(b) of this title shall be deemed to meet the applicable requirements of section 300j&ndash;13 of this title or section 300g&ndash;7(b) of this title unless the Administrator determines within 9 months of the receipt of the program that such program (or portion thereof) does not meet such requirements. If the Administrator determines that a proposed State program (or any portion thereof) is disapproved, the Administrator shall submit a written statement of the reasons for such determination to the Governor of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Modification and resubmission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after receipt of the Administrator's written notice under paragraph (1) <!-- PDFPage:906 -->that any proposed State program (or portion thereof) is disapproved, the Governor or Governor's designee, shall modify the program based upon the recommendations of the Administrator and resubmit the modified program to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Federal assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the date 3 years after June 19, 1986, no State shall receive funds authorized to be appropriated under this section except for the purpose of implementing the program and requirements of paragraphs (4) and (6) of subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Wellhead protection area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;wellhead protection area&rdquo; means the surface and subsurface area surrounding a water well or wellfield, supplying a public water system, through which contaminants are reasonably likely to move toward and reach such water well or wellfield. The extent of a wellhead protection area, within a State, necessary to provide protection from contaminants which may have any adverse effect on the health of persons is to be determined by the State in the program submitted under subsection (a) of this section. Not later than one year after June 19, 1986, the Administrator shall issue technical guidance which States may use in making such determinations. Such guidance may reflect such factors as the radius of influence around a well or wellfield, the depth of drawdown of the water table by such well or wellfield at any given point, the time or rate of travel of various contaminants in various hydrologic conditions, distance from the well or wellfield, or other factors affecting the likelihood of contaminants reaching the well or wellfield, taking into account available engineering pump tests or comparable data, field reconnaissance, topographic information, and the geology of the formation in which the well or wellfield is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibitions</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Activities under other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No funds authorized to be appropriated under this section may be used to support activities authorized by the Federal Water Pollution Control Act [33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.], the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.], the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 [42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.], or other sections of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Individual sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No funds authorized to be appropriated under this section may be used to bring individual sources of contamination into compliance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State shall make every reasonable effort to implement the State wellhead area protection program under this section within 2 years of submitting the program to the Administrator. Each State shall submit to the Administrator a biennial status report describing the State's progress in implementing the program. Such report shall include amendments to the State program for water wells sited during the biennial period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government having jurisdiction over any potential source of contaminants identified by a State program pursuant to the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section shall be subject to and comply with all requirements of the State program developed according to subsection (a)(4) of this section applicable to such potential source of contaminants, both substantive and procedural, in the same manner, and to the same extent, as any other person is subject to such requirements, including payment of reasonable charges and fees. The President may exempt any potential source under the jurisdiction of any department, agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch if the President determines it to be in the paramount interest of the United States to do so. No such exemption shall be granted due to the lack of an appropriation unless the President shall have specifically requested such appropriation as part of the budgetary process and the Congress shall have failed to make available such requested appropriations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Additional requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, States in which there are more than 2,500 active wells at which annular injection is used as of January 1, 1986, shall include in their State program a certification that a State program exists and is being adequately enforced that provides protection from contaminants which may have any adverse effect on the health of persons and which are associated with the annular injection or surface disposal of brines associated with oil and gas production.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) &ldquo;Annular injection&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;annular injection&rdquo; means the reinjection of brines associated with the production of oil or gas between the production and surface casings of a conventional oil or gas producing well.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall conduct a review of each program certified under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State fails to include the certification required by this subsection or if in the judgment of the Administrator the State program certified under this subsection is not being adequately enforced, the Administrator shall disapprove the State program submitted under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Coordination with other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall authorize or require any department, agency, or other instrumentality of the Federal Government or State or local government to apportion, allocate or otherwise regulate the withdrawal or beneficial use of ground or surface waters, so as to abro<!-- PDFPage:907 -->gate or modify any existing rights to water established pursuant to State or Federal law, including interstate compacts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the State program is disapproved under this section, the Administrator shall make grants to the State for not less than 50 or more than 90 percent of the costs incurred by a State (as determined by the Administrator) in developing and implementing each State program under this section. For purposes of making such grants there is authorized to be appropriated not more than the following amounts:</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Public water systems supervision programs; applications for grants; allotment of sums; waiver of grant restrictions; notice of approval or disapproval of application; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From allotments made pursuant to paragraph (4), the Administrator may make grants to States to carry out public water system supervision programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No grant may be made under paragraph (1) unless an application therefor has been submitted to the Administrator in such form and manner as he may require. The Administrator may not approve an application of a State for its first grant under paragraph (1) unless he determines that the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) has established or will establish within one year from the date of such grant a public water system supervision program, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will, within that one year, assume primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">No grant may be made to a State under paragraph (1) for any period beginning more than one year after the date of the State's first grant unless the State has assumed and maintains primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State. The prohibitions contained in the preceding two sentences shall not apply to such grants when made to Indian Tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A grant under paragraph (1) shall be made to cover not more than 75 per centum of the grant recipient's costs (as determined under regulations of the Administrator) in carrying out, during the one-year period beginning on the date the grant is made, a public water system supervision program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In each fiscal year the Administrator shall, in accordance, with regulations, allot the sums appropriated for such year under paragraph (5) among the States on the basis of population, geographical area, number of public water systems, and other relevant factors. No State shall receive less than 1 per centum of the annual appropriation for grants under paragraph (1): <em>Provided</em>, That the Administrator may, by regulation, reduce such percentage in accordance with the criteria specified in this paragraph: <em>And provided further</em>, That such percentage shall not apply to grants allotted to Guam, American Samoa, or the Virgin Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The prohibition contained in the last sentence of paragraph (2) may be waived by the Administrator with respect to a grant to a State through fiscal year 1979 but such prohibition may only be waived if, in the judgment of the Administrator&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State is making a diligent effort to assume and maintain primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems within the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State has made significant progress toward assuming and maintaining such primary enforcement responsibility; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there is reason to believe the State will assume such primary enforcement responsibility by October 1, 1979.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount of any grant awarded for the fiscal years 1978 and 1979 pursuant to a waiver under this paragraph may not exceed 75 per centum of the allotment which the State would have received for such fiscal year if it had assumed and maintained such primary enforcement responsibility. The remaining 25 per centum of the amount allotted to such State for such fiscal year shall be retained by the Administrator, and the Administrator may award such amount to such State at such time as the State assumes such responsibility before the beginning of fiscal year 1980. At the beginning of each fiscal years 1979 and 1980 the amounts retained by the Administrator for any preceding fiscal year and not awarded by the beginning of fiscal year 1979 or 1980 to the States to which such amounts were originally allotted may be removed from the original allotment and reallotted for fiscal year 1979 or 1980 (as the case may be) to States which have assumed primary enforcement responsibility by the beginning of such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Administrator shall notify the State of the approval or disapproval of any application for a grant under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within ninety days after receipt of such application, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not later than the first day of the fiscal year for which the grant application is made,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) <cap-smallcap>Reservation of funds by the administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator assumes the primary enforcement responsibility of a State public water system supervision program, the Administrator may reserve from funds made available pursuant to this subsection an amount equal to the amount that would otherwise have been provided to the State pursuant to this subsection. The Administrator shall use the funds reserved pursuant to this paragraph to ensure the full and effective administration of a public water system supervision program in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9) <cap-smallcap>State loan funds.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>Reservation of funds</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For any fiscal year for which the amount made available to the Administrator by appropriations to carry out this subsection is less than the amount <!-- PDFPage:917 -->that the Administrator determines is necessary to supplement funds made available pursuant to paragraph (8) to ensure the full and effective administration of a public water system supervision program in a State, the Administrator may reserve from the funds made available to the State under section 300j&ndash;12 of this title (relating to State loan funds) an amount that is equal to the amount of the shortfall. This paragraph shall not apply to any State not exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems as of August 6, 1996.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Duty of administrator</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;If the Administrator reserves funds from the allocation of a State under subparagraph (A), the Administrator shall carry out in the State each of the activities that would be required of the State if the State had primary enforcement authority under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) From allotments made pursuant to paragraph (4), the Administrator may make grants to States to carry out underground water source protection programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No grant may be made under paragraph (1) unless an application therefor has been submitted to the Administrator in such form and manner as he may require. No grant may be made to any State under paragraph (1) unless the State has assumed primary enforcement responsibility within two years after the date the Administrator promulgates regulations for State underground injection control programs under section 300h of this title. The prohibition contained in the preceding sentence shall not apply to such grants when made to Indian Tribes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A grant under paragraph (1) shall be made to cover not more than 75 per centum of the grant recipient's cost (as determined under regulations of the Administrator) in carrying out, during the one-year period beginning on the date the grant is made, and underground water source protection program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In each fiscal year the Administrator shall, in accordance with regulations, allot the sums appropriated for such year under paragraph (5) among the States on the basis of population, geographical area, and other relevant factors.</p>

Action of the Administrator with respect to which review could have been obtained under this subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement or in any civil action to enjoin enforcement. In any petition concerning the assessment of a civil penalty pursuant to section 300g&ndash;3(g)(3)(B) of this title, the petitioner shall simultaneously send a copy of the complaint by certified mail to the Administrator and the Attorney General.

Such an action may only be brought upon a petition for review filed with the court within the 45-day period beginning on the date the action sought to be reviewed is taken or, in the case of a petition to review the refusal to grant a variance or exemption or the failure to prescribe a schedule, within the 45-day period beginning on the date action is required to be taken on the variance, exemption, or schedule, as the case may be. A petition for such review may be filed after the expiration of such period if the petition is based solely on grounds arising after the expiration of such period. Action with respect to which review could have been obtained under this subsection shall not be subject to judicial review in any civil or criminal proceeding for enforcement or in any civil action to enjoin enforcement.</p>

The Administrator may modify his findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he shall file such modified or new findings, and his recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of his original determination, with the return of such additional evidence.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Grants to States to establish State loan funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall offer to enter into agreements with eligible States to make capitalization grants, including letters of credit, to the States under this subsection to further the health protection objectives of this subchapter, promote the efficient use of fund resources, and for other purposes as are specified in this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Establishment of fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To be eligible to receive a capitalization grant under this section, a State shall establish a drinking water treatment revolving loan fund (referred to in this section as a &ldquo;State loan fund&rdquo;) and comply with the other requirements of this section. Each grant to a State under this section shall be deposited in the State loan fund established by the State, except as otherwise provided in this section and in other provisions of this subchapter. No funds authorized by other provisions of this subchapter to be used for other purposes specified in this subchapter shall be deposited in any State loan fund.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Extended period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The grant to a State shall be available to the State for obligation during the fiscal year for which the funds are authorized and during the following fiscal year, except that grants made available from funds provided prior to fiscal year 1997 shall be available for obligation during each of the fiscal years 1997 and 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Allotment formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as otherwise provided in this section, funds made available to carry out this section shall be allotted to States that have entered into an agreement pursuant to this section (other than the District of Columbia) in accordance with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for each of fiscal years 1995 through 1997, a formula that is the same as the formula used to distribute public water system supervision grant funds under section 300j&ndash;2 of this title in fiscal year 1995, except that the minimum proportionate share established in the formula shall be 1 percent of available funds and the formula shall be adjusted to include a minimum proportionate share for the State of Wyoming and the District of Columbia; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for fiscal year 1998 and each subsequent fiscal year, a formula that allocates to each State the proportional share of the State needs identified in the most recent survey conducted pursuant to subsection (h) of this section, except that the minimum proportionate share provided to each State shall be the same as the minimum proportionate share provided under clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Reallotment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The grants not obligated by the last day of the period for which the grants are available shall be reallotted according to the appropriate criteria set forth in subparagraph (D), except that the Administrator may reserve and allocate 10 percent of the remaining amount for financial assistance to Indian Tribes in addition to the amount allotted under subsection (i) of this section and none of the funds reallotted by the Administrator shall be reallotted to any State that has not obligated all sums allotted to the State pursuant to this section during the period in which the sums were available for obligation.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Nonprimacy States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The State allotment for a State not exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems shall not be deposited in any such fund but shall be allotted by the Administrator under this subparagraph. Pursuant to section 300j&ndash;2(a)(9)(A) of this title such sums allotted under this subparagraph shall be reserved as needed by the Administrator to exercise primary enforcement responsibility under this subchapter in such State and the remainder shall be reallotted to States exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems for deposit in such funds. Whenever the Administrator makes a final determination pursuant to section 300g&ndash;2(b) of this title that the requirements of section 300g&ndash;2(a) of this title are no longer being met by a State, additional grants for such State under this subchapter shall be immediately terminated by the Administrator. This subparagraph shall not apply to any State not exercising primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems as of August 6, 1996.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Other programs</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) New system capacity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Beginning in fiscal year 1999, the Administrator shall withhold 20 percent of each capitalization grant made pursuant to this section to a State unless the State has met the requirements of section 300g&ndash;9(a) of this title (relating to capacity development) and shall withhold 10 percent for fiscal year 2001, 15 percent for fiscal year 2002, and 20 percent for fiscal year 2003 if the State has not complied with the provisions of section 300g&ndash;9(c) of this title (relating to capacity development strategies). Not more than a total of 20 percent of the capitalization grants made to a State in any fiscal year may be withheld under the preceding provisions of this clause. All funds withheld by the Administrator pursuant to this clause shall be reallotted by the Administrator on the basis of the same ratio as is applicable to funds allotted under subparagraph (D). None of the funds reallotted by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph shall be allotted to a State unless the State has met the requirements of section 300g&ndash;9 of this title (relating to capacity development).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Operator certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Administrator shall withhold 20 percent of each capitalization grant made <!-- PDFPage:932 -->pursuant to this section unless the State has met the requirements of 300g&ndash;8&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300j-12_1_target" name="300j-12_1">1</a></sup> of this title (relating to operator certification). All funds withheld by the Administrator pursuant to this clause shall be reallotted by the Administrator on the basis of the same ratio as applicable to funds allotted under subparagraph (D). None of the funds reallotted by the Administrator pursuant to this paragraph shall be allotted to a State unless the State has met the requirements of section 300g&ndash;8 of this title (relating to operator certification).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as otherwise authorized by this subchapter, amounts deposited in a State loan fund, including loan repayments and interest earned on such amounts, shall be used only for providing loans or loan guarantees, or as a source of reserve and security for leveraged loans, the proceeds of which are deposited in a State loan fund established under paragraph (1), or other financial assistance authorized under this section to community water systems and nonprofit noncommunity water systems, other than systems owned by Federal agencies. Financial assistance under this section may be used by a public water system only for expenditures (not including monitoring, operation, and maintenance expenditures) of a type or category which the Administrator has determined, through guidance, will facilitate compliance with national primary drinking water regulations applicable to the system under section 300g&ndash;1 of this title or otherwise significantly further the health protection objectives of this subchapter. The funds may also be used to provide loans to a system referred to in section 300f(4)(B) of this title for the purpose of providing the treatment described in section 300f(4)(B)(i)(III) of this title. The funds shall not be used for the acquisition of real property or interests therein, unless the acquisition is integral to a project authorized by this paragraph and the purchase is from a willing seller. Of the amount credited to any State loan fund established under this section in any fiscal year, 15 percent shall be available solely for providing loan assistance to public water systems which regularly serve fewer than 10,000 persons to the extent such funds can be obligated for eligible projects of public water systems.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), no assistance under this section shall be provided to a public water system that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not have the technical, managerial, and financial capability to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is in significant noncompliance with any requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation or variance.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Restructuring</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A public water system described in subparagraph (A) may receive assistance under this section if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the use of the assistance will ensure compliance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if subparagraph (A)(i) applies to the system, the owner or operator of the system agrees to undertake feasible and appropriate changes in operations (including ownership, management, accounting, rates, maintenance, consolidation, alternative water supply, or other procedures) if the State determines that the measures are necessary to ensure that the system has the technical, managerial, and financial capability to comply with the requirements of this subchapter over the long term.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Prior to providing assistance under this section to a public water system that is in significant noncompliance with any requirement of a national primary drinking water regulation or variance, the State shall conduct a review to determine whether subparagraph (A)(i) applies to the system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Intended use plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After providing for public review and comment, each State that has entered into a capitalization agreement pursuant to this section shall annually prepare a plan that identifies the intended uses of the amounts available to the State loan fund of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An intended use plan shall include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a description of the financial status of the State loan fund and the short-term and long-term goals of the State loan fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Use of funds</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An intended use plan shall provide, to the maximum extent practicable, that priority for the use of funds be given to projects that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) address the most serious risk to human health;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are necessary to ensure compliance with the requirements of this subchapter (including requirements for filtration); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) assist systems most in need on a per household basis according to State affordability criteria.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) List of projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State shall, after notice and opportunity for public comment, publish and periodically update a list of projects in the State that are eligible for assistance under this <!-- PDFPage:933 -->section, including the priority assigned to each project and, to the extent known, the expected funding schedule for each project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Fund management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State loan fund under this section shall be established, maintained, and credited with repayments and interest. The fund corpus shall be available in perpetuity for providing financial assistance under this section. To the extent amounts in the fund are not required for current obligation or expenditure, such amounts shall be invested in interest bearing obligations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assistance for disadvantaged communities</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Loan subsidy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, in any case in which the State makes a loan pursuant to subsection (a)(2) of this section to a disadvantaged community or to a community that the State expects to become a disadvantaged community as the result of a proposed project, the State may provide additional subsidization (including forgiveness of principal).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Total amount of subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each fiscal year, the total amount of loan subsidies made by a State pursuant to paragraph (1) may not exceed 30 percent of the amount of the capitalization grant received by the State for the year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) &ldquo;Disadvantaged community&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the term &ldquo;disadvantaged community&rdquo; means the service area of a public water system that meets affordability criteria established after public review and comment by the State in which the public water system is located. The Administrator may publish information to assist States in establishing affordability criteria.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each agreement under subsection (a) of this section shall require that the State deposit in the State loan fund from State moneys an amount equal to at least 20 percent of the total amount of the grant to be made to the State on or before the date on which the grant payment is made to the State, except that a State shall not be required to deposit such amount into the fund prior to the date on which each grant payment is made for fiscal years 1994, 1995, 1996, and 1997 if the State deposits the State contribution amount into the State loan fund prior to September 30, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Types of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise limited by State law, the amounts deposited into a State loan fund under this section may be used only&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) principal and interest payments on each loan will commence not later than 1 year after completion of the project for which the loan was made, and each loan will be fully amortized not later than 20 years after the completion of the project, except that in the case of a disadvantaged community (as defined in subsection (d)(3) of this section), a State may provide an extended term for a loan, if the extended term&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) terminates not later than the date that is 30 years after the date of project completion; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) does not exceed the expected design life of the project;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the recipient of each loan will establish a dedicated source of revenue (or, in the case of a privately owned system, demonstrate that there is adequate security) for the repayment of the loan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the State loan fund will be credited with all payments of principal and interest on each loan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to buy or refinance the debt obligation of a municipality or an intermunicipal or interstate agency within the State at an interest rate that is less than or equal to the market interest rate in any case in which a debt obligation is incurred after July 1, 1993;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to guarantee, or purchase insurance for, a local obligation (all of the proceeds of which finance a project eligible for assistance under this section) if the guarantee or purchase would improve credit market access or reduce the interest rate applicable to the obligation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) as a source of revenue or security for the payment of principal and interest on revenue or general obligation bonds issued by the State if the proceeds of the sale of the bonds will be deposited into the State loan fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to earn interest on the amounts deposited into the State loan fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Administration of State loan funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Combined financial administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding subsection (c) of this section, a State may (as a convenience and to avoid unnecessary administrative costs) combine, in accordance with State law, the financial administration of a State loan fund established under this section with the financial administration of any other revolving fund established by the State if otherwise not prohibited by the law under which the State loan fund was established and if the Administrator determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the grants under this section, together with loan repayments and interest, will be separately accounted for and used solely for the purposes specified in subsection (a) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the authority to establish assistance priorities and carry out oversight and related activities (other than financial administration) with respect to assistance remains with the State agency having primary responsibility for administration of the State program under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title, after consultation with other appropriate State agencies (as determined by the State): <em>Provided</em>, That in nonprimacy States eligible to receive assistance under this section, the Governor shall determine which State agency will have authority to establish priorities for financial assistance from the State loan fund.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:934 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cost of administering fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State may annually use up to 4 percent of the funds allotted to the State under this section to cover the reasonable costs of administration of the programs under this section, including the recovery of reasonable costs expended to establish a State loan fund which are incurred after August 6, 1996, and to provide technical assistance to public water systems within the State. For fiscal year 1995 and each fiscal year thereafter, each State may use up to an additional 10 percent of the funds allotted to the State under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for public water system supervision programs under section 300j&ndash;2(a) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to administer or provide technical assistance through source water protection programs;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if the State matches the expenditures with at least an equal amount of State funds. At least half of the match must be additional to the amount expended by the State for public water supervision in fiscal year 1993. An additional 2 percent of the funds annually allotted to each State under this section may be used by the State to provide technical assistance to public water systems serving 10,000 or fewer persons in the State.

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) guidance to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) guidance to avoid the use of funds made available under this section to finance the expansion of any public water system in anticipation of future population growth.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The guidance and regulations shall also ensure that the States, and public water systems receiving assistance under this section, use accounting, audit, and fiscal procedures that conform to generally accepted accounting standards.</p>
