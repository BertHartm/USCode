<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to establish such fiscal control and fund accounting procedures as may be necessary to ensure proper disbursement and accounting of Federal funds paid to the applicant under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to report to the Secretary annually on the utilization, cost, and outcome of activities conducted, and services furnished, under this section; and</p>
