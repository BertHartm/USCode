<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i)(I) For each fiscal year in which the sums appropriated under this subchapter exceed the amount appropriated under this subchapter for fiscal year 1978, the Secretary shall reserve not more than 45 percent of such excess, except as provided in subclause (II), to carry out clauses (ii), (iii), and (v).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the amount appropriated under this subchapter for a fiscal year exceeds 102 percent of the amount appropriated under this subchapter for fiscal year 1991, for each fiscal year described in clause (iv), the Secretary shall reserve for recipients of national grants and contracts under this paragraph such portion of the excess amount as the Secretary determines to be appropriate and is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the portion required to increase the amount made available under this paragraph to each of the recipients so that the amount equals 1.3 percent of the amount appropriated under this subchapter for fiscal year 1991.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) From the portion reserved under clause (iii), the Secretary shall increase the amount made available under this paragraph to each of the recipients&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) for each fiscal year before the fiscal year described in subclause (II), so that such amount equals, or more closely approaches, such 1.3 percent; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) From sums appropriated under this subchapter for each fiscal year after September 30, 1978, the Secretary shall reserve an amount which is at least 1 percent and not more than 3 percent of the amount appropriated in excess of the amount appropriated for fiscal year 1978 for the purpose of entering into agreements under section 3056(e) of this title, relating to improved transition to private employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After the Secretary makes the reservations required by paragraph (1)(B) and subparagraph (A), the remainder of such excess shall be allotted to the appropriate public agency of each State pursuant to paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall allot to the State agency on aging of each State the remainder of the sums appropriated for any fiscal year under section 3056f of this title so that each State will receive an amount which bears the same ratio to such remainder as the product of the number of persons aged fifty-five or over in the State and the allotment percentage of such State bears to the sum of the corresponding product for all States, except that (A) no State shall be allotted less than one-half of 1 percent of the remainder of the sums appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, or $100,000, whichever is greater, and (B) Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands shall each be allotted an amount which is not less than one-fourth of 1 percent of the remainder of the sums appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made, or $50,000, whichever is greater.

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purpose of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the allotment percentage of each State shall be 100 percent less that percentage which bears the same ratio to 50 percent as the per capita income of such State bears to the per capita income of the United States, except that (i) the allotment percentage shall in no case be more than 75 percent or less than 331/3 percent, and (ii) the allotment percentage for the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands shall be 75 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the number of persons aged fifty-five or over in any State and in all States, and the per capita income in any State and in all States, shall be determined by the Secretary on the basis of the most satisfactory data available to the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for the purpose of determining the allotment percentage, the term &ldquo;United States&rdquo; means the fifty States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reallotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount allotted for projects within any State under subsection (a) of this section for any fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required for such year shall be reallotted, from time to time and on such dates during such year as the Secretary may fix, to projects within other States in proportion to the original allotments to projects within such States under subsection (a) of this section for such year, but with such proportionate amount for any of such other States being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates that projects within such State need and will be able to use for such year; and the total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount reallotted to a State under this subsection during a year shall be deemed part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Equitable distribution of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount apportioned for projects within each State under subsection (a) of this section shall be apportioned among areas within each such State in an equitable manner, taking into consideration (1) the proportion which eligible individuals in each such area bears to the total number of such individuals, respectively, in that State, (2) the relative distribution of such individuals residing in rural and urban areas within the State, and (3) the relative distribution of (A) such individuals who are individuals with greatest economic need, (B) such individuals who are minority individuals, and (C) such individuals who are individuals with greatest social need.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compliance reports by State agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require the State agency for each State receiving funds under this subchapter to report at the beginning of each fiscal year on such State's compliance with subsection (c) of this section. Such report shall include the names and geographic location of all projects assisted under this subchapter and carried out in the State and the amount allotted to each such project.</p>
