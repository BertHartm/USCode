<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;145, &sect;2, Dec. 2, 2003, 117 Stat. 1879, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In 1997, the Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 [Pub. L. 105&ndash;89; see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1305 of this title] to promote comprehensive child welfare reform to ensure that consideration of children's safety is paramount in child welfare decisions, and to provide a greater sense of urgency to find every child a safe, permanent home.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 also created the Adoption Incentives program, which authorizes incentive payments to States to promote adoptions, with additional incentives provided for the adoption of foster children with special needs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Since 1997, all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have qualified for incentive pay<!-- PDFPage:1634 -->ments for their work in promoting adoption of foster children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Between 1997 and 2002, adoptions increased by 64 percent, and adoptions of children with special needs increased by 63 percent; however, 542,000 children remain in foster care, and 126,000 are eligible for adoption.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Although substantial progress has been made to promote adoptions, attention should be focused on promoting adoption of older children. Recent data suggest that half of the children waiting to be adopted are age 9 or older.&rdquo;</p>
