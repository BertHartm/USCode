<p class="statutory-body">It shall be considered discrimination for purposes of section 12132 of this title and section 794 of title 29 for a public entity which operates a fixed route system (other than a system which provides solely commuter bus service) to fail to provide with respect to the operations of its <!-- PDFPage:7229 -->fixed route system, in accordance with this section, paratransit and other special transportation services to individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs, that are sufficient to provide to such individuals a level of service (1) which is comparable to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system; or (2) in the case of response time, which is comparable, to the extent practicable, to the level of designated public transportation services provided to individuals without disabilities using such system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after July 26, 1990, the Secretary shall issue final regulations to carry out this section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Eligible recipients of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under this section shall require each public entity which operates a fixed route system to provide the paratransit and other special transportation services required under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A)(i) to any individual with a disability who is unable, as a result of a physical or mental impairment (including a vision impairment) and without the assistance of another individual (except an operator of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device), to board, ride, or disembark from any vehicle on the system which is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) to any individual with a disability who needs the assistance of a wheelchair lift or other boarding assistance device (and is able with such assistance) to board, ride, and disembark from any vehicle which is readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities if the individual wants to travel on a route on the system during the hours of operation of the system at a time (or within a reasonable period of such time) when such a vehicle is not being used to provide designated public transportation on the route; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) to any individual with a disability who has a specific impairment-related condition which prevents such individual from traveling to a boarding location or from a disembarking location on such system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to one other individual accompanying the individual with the disability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to other individuals, in addition to the one individual described in subparagraph (B), accompanying the individual with a disability provided that space for these additional individuals is available on the paratransit vehicle carrying the individual with a disability and that the transportation of such additional individuals will not result in a denial of service to individuals with disabilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of clauses (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A), boarding or disembarking from a vehicle does not include travel to the boarding location or from the disembarking location.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Service criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraphs (1) and (2), the regulations issued under this section shall establish minimum service criteria for determining the level of services to be required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Undue financial burden limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under this section shall provide that, if the public entity is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the provision of paratransit and other special transportation services otherwise required under this section would impose an undue financial burden on the public entity, the public entity, notwithstanding any other provision of this section (other than paragraph (5)), shall only be required to provide such services to the extent that providing such services would not impose such a burden.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Additional services</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Public participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under this section shall require that each public entity which operates a fixed route system hold a public hearing, provide an opportunity for public comment, and consult with individuals with disabilities in preparing its plan under paragraph (7).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Provision of services by others</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under this section shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) require that a public entity submitting a plan to the Secretary under this section identify in the plan any person or other public entity which is providing a paratransit or other special transportation service for indi<!-- PDFPage:7230 -->viduals with disabilities in the service area to which the plan applies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide that the public entity submitting the plan does not have to provide under the plan such service for individuals with disabilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Other provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations issued under this section shall include such other provisions and requirements as the Secretary determines are necessary to carry out the objectives of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Review of plan</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall review a plan submitted under this section for the purpose of determining whether or not such plan meets the requirements of this section, including the regulations issued under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a plan reviewed under this subsection fails to meet the requirements of this section, the Secretary shall disapprove the plan and notify the public entity which submitted the plan of such disapproval and the reasons therefor.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Discrimination&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in subsection (a) of this section, the term &ldquo;discrimination&rdquo; includes&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a failure of such entity to submit, or commence implementation of, a modified plan in accordance with subsection (d)(3) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) submission to the Secretary of a modified plan under subsection (d)(3) of this section which does not meet the requirements of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a failure of such entity to provide paratransit or other special transportation services in accordance with the plan or modified plan the public entity submitted to the Secretary under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Statutory construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a public entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) from providing paratransit or other special transportation services at a level which is greater than the level of such services which are required by this section,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) from providing paratransit or other special transportation services in addition to those paratransit and special transportation services required by this section, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) from providing such services to individuals in addition to those individuals to whom such services are required to be provided by this section.</p>
