<p class="statutory-body">In order to maximize the cost-effectiveness of the long-term exploration and utilization activities of the United States, the Administrator shall take all necessary steps, including engaging international partners, to ensure that activities in its lunar exploration program shall be designed and implemented in a manner that gives strong consideration to how those activities might also help meet the requirements of future exploration and utilization activities beyond the Moon. The timetable of the lunar phase of the long-term international exploration initiative shall be determined by the availability of funding. However, once an exploration-related project enters its development phase, the Administrator shall seek, to the maximum extent practicable, to complete that project without undue delays.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As NASA works toward the establishment of a lunar outpost, NASA shall make no plans that would require a lunar outpost to be occupied to maintain its viability. Any such outpost shall be <!-- PDFPage:7533 -->operable as a human-tended facility capable of remote or autonomous operation for extended periods.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States portion of the first human-tended outpost established on the surface of the Moon shall be designated the &ldquo;Neil A. Armstrong Lunar Outpost&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that NASA should make use of commercial services to the maximum extent practicable in support of its lunar outpost activities.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A robust program of long-term exploration-related technology research and development will be essential for the success and sustainability of any enduring initiative of human and robotic exploration of the solar system.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall carry out a program of long-term exploration-related technology research and development, including such things as in-space propulsion, power systems, life support, and advanced avionics, that is not tied to specific flight projects. The program shall have the funding goal of ensuring that the technology research and development can be completed in a timely manner in order to support the safe, successful, and sustainable exploration of the solar system. In addition, in order to ensure that the broadest range of innovative concepts and technologies are captured, the long-term technology program shall have the goal of having a significant portion of its funding available for external grants and contracts with universities, research institutions, and industry.</p>
