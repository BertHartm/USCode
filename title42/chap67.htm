<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the number of children in substitute care has increased by nearly 24 percent since 1994, as our Nation's foster care population included more than 565,000 as of September of 2001;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) children entering foster care have complex problems that require intensive services, with many such children having special needs because they are born to mothers who did not receive prenatal care, are born with life threatening conditions or disabilities, are born addicted to alcohol or other drugs, or have been exposed to infection with the etiologic agent for the human immunodeficiency virus;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) each year, thousands of children are in need of placement in permanent, adoptive homes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) many thousands of children remain in institutions or foster homes solely because of legal and other barriers to their placement in permanent, adoptive homes;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4756 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) currently, there are 131,000 children waiting for adoption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such children are typically school aged, in sibling groups, have experienced neglect or abuse, or have a physical, mental, or emotional disability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) while the children are of all races, children of color and older children (over the age of 10) are over represented in such group;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) adoption may be the best alternative for assuring the healthy development of such children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) there are qualified persons seeking to adopt such children who are unable to do so because of barriers to their placement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) in order both to enhance the stability and love of the child's home environment and to avoid wasteful expenditures of public funds, such children should not have medically indicated treatment withheld from them nor be maintained in foster care or institutions when adoption is appropriate and families can be found for such children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this subchapter to facilitate the elimination of barriers, including geographic barriers, to adoption and to provide permanent and loving home environments for children who would benefit from adoption, particularly children with special needs, including disabled infants with life-threatening conditions, by providing a mechanism to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote quality standards for adoption services, pre-placement, post-placement, and post-legal adoption counseling, and standards to protect the rights of children in need of adoption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) maintain an Internet-based national adoption information exchange system to bring together children who would benefit from adoption and qualified prospective adoptive parents who are seeking such children, and conduct national recruitment efforts in order to reach prospective parents for children awaiting adoption; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) demonstrate expeditious ways to free children for adoption for whom it has been determined that adoption is the appropriate plan.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) studies indicate that a number of factors contribute to the inability of some parents to provide adequate care for their infants and young children and a lack of suitable shelter homes for such infants and young children have led to the abandonment of such infants and young children in hospitals for extended periods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an unacceptable number of these infants and young children will be medically cleared for discharge, yet remain in hospitals as boarder babies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) hospital-based child care for these infants and young children is extremely costly and deprives them of an adequate nurturing environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) appropriate training is needed for personnel working with infants and young children with life-threatening conditions and other special needs, including those who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (commonly known as &ldquo;HIV&rdquo;), those who have acquired immune deficiency syndrome (commonly known as &ldquo;AIDS&rdquo;), and those who have been exposed to dangerous drugs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) infants and young children who are abandoned in hospitals are particularly difficult to place in foster homes, and are being abandoned in hospitals in increasing numbers by mothers dying of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, by parents abusing drugs, or by parents incapable of providing adequate care;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) there is a need for comprehensive support services for such infants and young children and their families and services to prevent the abandonment of such infants and young children, including foster care services, case management services, family support services, respite and crisis intervention services, counseling services, and group residential home services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) there is a need to support the families of such infants and young children through the provision of services that will prevent the abandonment of the infants and children; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) private, Federal, State, and local resources should be coordinated to establish and maintain services described in paragraph (7) and to ensure the optimal use of all such resources.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5119a. Background checks</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A State may have in effect procedures (established by State statute or regulation) that require qualified entities designated by the State to contact an authorized agency of the State to request a nationwide background check for the purpose of determining whether a provider has been convicted of a crime that bears upon the provider's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authorized agency shall access and review State and Federal criminal history records through the national criminal history background check system and shall make reasonable efforts to respond to the inquiry within 15 business days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the absence of State procedures referred to in paragraph (1), a qualified entity designated under paragraph (1) may contact an authorized agency of the State to request national criminal fingerprint background checks. Qualified entities requesting background checks under this paragraph shall comply with the guidelines set forth in subsection (b) of this section and with procedures for requesting national criminal fingerprint background checks, if any, established by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procedures established under subsection (a) of this section shall require&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that no qualified entity may request a background check of a provider under subsection (a) of this section unless the provider first provides a set of fingerprints and completes and signs a statement that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) contains the name, address, and date of birth appearing on a valid identification document (as defined in section 1028 of title 18) of the provider;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the provider has not been convicted of a crime and, if the provider has been convicted of a crime, contains a description of the crime and the particulars of the conviction;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notifies the provider that the entity may request a background check under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) notifies the provider of the provider's rights under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) notifies the provider that prior to the completion of the background check the qualified entity may choose to deny the provider unsupervised access to a person to whom the qualified entity provides care;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that each provider who is the subject of a background check is entitled&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to obtain a copy of any background check report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to challenge the accuracy and completeness of any information contained in any such report and obtain a prompt determination as to the validity of such challenge before a final determination is made by the authorized agency;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that an authorized agency, upon receipt of a background check report lacking disposition data, shall conduct research in whatever State and local recordkeeping systems are available in order to obtain complete data;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that the authorized agency shall make a determination whether the provider has been <!-- PDFPage:4775 -->convicted of, or is under pending indictment for, a crime that bears upon the provider's fitness to have responsibility for the safety and well-being of children, the elderly, or individuals with disabilities and shall convey that determination to the qualified entity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that any background check under subsection (a) of this section and the results thereof shall be handled in accordance with the requirements of Public Law 92&ndash;544, except that this paragraph does not apply to any request by a qualified entity for a national criminal fingerprint background check pursuant to subsection (a)(3) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Attorney General may by regulation prescribe such other measures as may be required to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, including measures relating to the security, confidentiality, accuracy, use, misuse, and dissemination of information, and audits and recordkeeping.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Attorney General shall, to the maximum extent possible, encourage the use of the best technology available in conducting background checks.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A qualified entity shall not be liable in an action for damages solely for failure to conduct a criminal background check on a provider, nor shall a State or political subdivision thereof nor any agency, officer or employee thereof, be liable in an action for damages for the failure of a qualified entity (other than itself) to take action adverse to a provider who was the subject of a background check.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of a background check pursuant to a State requirement adopted after December 20, 1993, conducted with fingerprints on a person who volunteers with a qualified entity, the fees collected by authorized State agencies and the Federal Bureau of Investigation may not exceed eighteen dollars, respectively, or the actual cost, whichever is less, of the background check conducted with fingerprints. The States shall establish fee systems that insure that fees to non-profit entities for background checks do not discourage volunteers from participating in child care programs.</p>
