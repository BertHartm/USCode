<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) consistent with a comprehensive economic development strategy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supplementary grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">On the application of an eligible recipient, the Secretary may make a supplementary grant for a project for which the eligible recipient is eligible but, because of the eligible recipient's economic situation, for which the eligible recipient cannot provide the required non-Federal share.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purposes of grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Supplementary grants under paragraph (1) may be made for purposes that shall include enabling eligible recipients to use&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designated Federal grant programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) direct grants authorized under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements applicable to supplementary grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Amount of supplementary grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (4), the amount of a supplementary grant under this subchapter for a project shall not exceed the applicable percentage of the cost of the project established by regulations promulgated by the Secretary, except that the non-Federal share of the cost of a project (including assumptions of debt) shall not be less than 20 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Form of supplementary grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In accordance with such regulations as the Secretary may promulgate, the Secretary <!-- PDFPage:4117 -->shall make supplementary grants by increasing the amounts of grants authorized under this subchapter or by the payment of funds made available under this chapter to the heads of the Federal agencies responsible for carrying out the applicable Federal programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Federal share limitations specified in other laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any requirement as to the amount or source of non-Federal funds that may be applicable to a Federal program, funds provided under this section may be used to increase the Federal share for specific projects under the program that are carried out in areas described in section 3161(a) of this title above the Federal share of the cost of the project authorized by the law governing the program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Lower non-Federal share</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a grant to an Indian tribe, the Secretary may reduce the non-Federal share below the percentage specified in paragraph (1) or may waive the non-Federal share.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certain States, political subdivisions, and nonprofit organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a grant to a State, or a political subdivision of a State, that the Secretary determines has exhausted its effective taxing and borrowing capacity, or in the case of a grant to a nonprofit organization that the Secretary determines has exhausted its effective borrowing capacity, the Secretary may reduce the non-Federal share below the percentage specified in paragraph (1).</p>
