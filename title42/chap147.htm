<!-- field-start:head -->
<h3 class="section-head">&sect;15601. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 2,100,146 persons were incarcerated in the United States at the end of 2001: 1,324,465 in Federal and State prisons and 631,240 in county and local jails. In 1999, there were more than 10,000,000 separate admissions to and discharges from prisons and jails.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Insufficient research has been conducted and insufficient data reported on the extent of prison rape. However, experts have conservatively estimated that at least 13 percent of the inmates in the United States have been sexually assaulted in prison. Many inmates have suffered repeated assaults. Under this estimate, nearly 200,000 inmates now incarcerated have been or will be the victims of prison rape. The total number of inmates who have been sexually assaulted in the past 20 years likely exceeds 1,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Inmates with mental illness are at increased risk of sexual victimization. America's jails and prisons house more mentally ill individuals than all of the Nation's psychiatric hospitals combined. As many as 16 percent of inmates in State prisons and jails, and 7 percent of Federal inmates, suffer from mental illness.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Young first-time offenders are at increased risk of sexual victimization. Juveniles are 5 times more likely to be sexually assaulted in adult rather than juvenile facilities&mdash;often within the first 48 hours of incarceration.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Most prison staff are not adequately trained or prepared to prevent, report, or treat inmate sexual assaults.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6846 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Prison rape often goes unreported, and inmate victims often receive inadequate treatment for the severe physical and psychological effects of sexual assault&mdash;if they receive treatment at all.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) HIV and AIDS are major public health problems within America's correctional facilities. In 2000, 25,088 inmates in Federal and State prisons were known to be infected with HIV/AIDS. In 2000, HIV/AIDS accounted for more than 6 percent of all deaths in Federal and State prisons. Infection rates for other sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, and hepatitis B and C are also far greater for prisoners than for the American population as a whole. Prison rape undermines the public health by contributing to the spread of these diseases, and often giving a potential death sentence to its victims.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Prison rape endangers the public safety by making brutalized inmates more likely to commit crimes when they are released&mdash;as 600,000 inmates are each year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The frequently interracial character of prison sexual assaults significantly exacerbates interracial tensions, both within prison and, upon release of perpetrators and victims from prison, in the community at large.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Prison rape increases the level of homicides and other violence against inmates and staff, and the risk of insurrections and riots.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Victims of prison rape suffer severe physical and psychological effects that hinder their ability to integrate into the community and maintain stable employment upon their release from prison. They are thus more likely to become homeless and/or require government assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Members of the public and government officials are largely unaware of the epidemic character of prison rape and the day-to-day horror experienced by victimized inmates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) The high incidence of sexual assault within prisons involves actual and potential violations of the United States Constitution. In Farmer v. Brennan, 511 U.S. 825 (1994), the Supreme Court ruled that deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of sexual assault violates prisoners&rsquo; rights under the Cruel and Unusual Punishments Clause of the Eighth Amendment. The Eighth Amendment rights of State and local prisoners are protected through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Pursuant to the power of Congress under Section Five of the Fourteenth Amendment, Congress may take action to enforce those rights in States where officials have demonstrated such indifference. States that do not take basic steps to abate prison rape by adopting standards that do not generate significant additional expenditures demonstrate such indifference. Therefore, such States are not entitled to the same level of Federal benefits as other States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) The high incidence of prison rape undermines the effectiveness and efficiency of United States Government expenditures through grant programs such as those dealing with health care; mental health care; disease prevention; crime prevention, investigation, and prosecution; prison construction, maintenance, and operation; race relations; poverty; unemployment and homelessness. The effectiveness and efficiency of these federally funded grant programs are compromised by the failure of State officials to adopt policies and procedures that reduce the incidence of prison rape in that the high incidence of prison rape&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increases the costs incurred by Federal, State, and local jurisdictions to administer their prison systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) increases the levels of violence, directed at inmates and at staff, within prisons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increases health care expenditures, both inside and outside of prison systems, and reduces the effectiveness of disease prevention programs by substantially increasing the incidence and spread of HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, and other diseases;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) increases mental health care expenditures, both inside and outside of prison systems, by substantially increasing the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and the exacerbation of existing mental illnesses among current and former inmates;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) increases the risks of recidivism, civil strife, and violent crime by individuals who have been brutalized by prison rape; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increases the level of interracial tensions and strife within prisons and, upon release of perpetrators and victims, in the community at large.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) The high incidence of prison rape has a significant effect on interstate commerce because it increases substantially&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the costs incurred by Federal, State, and local jurisdictions to administer their prison systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the incidence and spread of HIV, AIDS, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, and other diseases, contributing to increased health and medical expenditures throughout the Nation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the rate of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, suicide, and the exacerbation of existing mental illnesses among current and former inmates, contributing to increased health and medical expenditures throughout the Nation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the risk of recidivism, civil strife, and violent crime by individuals who have been brutalized by prison rape.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Annual comprehensive statistical review</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau of Justice Statistics of the Department of Justice (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Bureau&rdquo;) shall carry out, for each calendar year, a comprehensive statistical review and analysis of the incidence and effects of prison rape. The statistical review and analysis shall include, but not be limited to the identification of the common characteristics of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) both victims and perpetrators of prison rape; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison rape.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Considerations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out paragraph (1), the Bureau shall consider&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) how rape should be defined for the purposes of the statistical review and analysis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) how the Bureau should collect information about staff-on-inmate sexual assault;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) how the Bureau should collect information beyond inmate self-reports of prison rape;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) how the Bureau should adjust the data in order to account for differences among prisons as required by subsection (c)(3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the categorization of prisons as required by subsection (c)(4); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) whether a preliminary study of prison rape should be conducted to inform the methodology of the comprehensive statistical review.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Solicitation of views</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Bureau of Justice Statistics shall solicit views from representatives of the following: State departments of correction; county and municipal jails; juvenile correctional facilities; former inmates; victim advocates; researchers; and other experts in the area of sexual assault.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Sampling techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The review and analysis under paragraph (1) shall be based on a random sample, or other scientifically appropriate sample, of not less than 10 percent of all Federal, State, and county prisons, and a representative sample of municipal prisons. The selection shall include at least one prison from each State. The selection of facilities for sampling shall be made at the latest practicable date prior to conducting the surveys and shall not be disclosed to any facility or prison system official prior to the time period studied in the survey. Selection of a facility for sampling during any year shall not preclude its selection for sampling in any subsequent year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Surveys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the review and analysis under paragraph (1), the Bureau shall, in addition to such other methods as the Bureau considers appropriate, use surveys and other statistical studies of current and former inmates from a sample of Federal, State, county, and municipal prisons. The Bureau shall ensure the confidentiality of each survey participant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Participation in survey</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Federal, State, or local officials or facility administrators that receive a request from the Bureau under subsection (a)(4) or (5) will be required to participate in the national survey and provide access to any inmates under their legal custody.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Review Panel on Prison Rape</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To assist the Bureau in carrying out the review and analysis under subsection (a), there is established, within the Department of Justice, the Review Panel on Prison Rape (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Panel&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Membership</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Composition</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The duty of the Panel shall be to carry out, for each calendar year, public hearings concerning the operation of the three prisons with the highest incidence of prison rape and the two prisons with the lowest incidence of prison rape in each category of facilities identified under subsection (c)(4). The Panel shall hold a separate hearing regarding the three Federal or State prisons with the highest incidence of prison rape. The purpose of these hearings shall be to collect evidence to aid in the identification of common characteristics of both victims and perpetrators of prison rape, and the identification of common characteristics of prisons and prison systems with a high incidence of prison rape, and the identification <!-- PDFPage:6848 -->of common characteristics of prisons and prison systems that appear to have been successful in deterring prison rape.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Testimony at hearings</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Public officials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In carrying out the hearings required under subparagraph (A), the Panel shall request the public testimony of Federal, State, and local officials (and organizations that represent such officials), including the warden or director of each prison, who bears responsibility for the prevention, detection, and punishment of prison rape at each entity, and the head of the prison system encompassing such prison.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Victims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Panel may request the testimony of prison rape victims, organizations representing such victims, and other appropriate individuals and organizations.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Subpoenas</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Issuance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Panel may issue subpoenas for the attendance of witnesses and the production of written or other matter.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Enforcement</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than June 30 of each year, the Attorney General shall submit a report on the activities of the Bureau and the Review Panel, with respect to prison rape, for the preceding calendar year to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Secretary of Health and Human Services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The report required under paragraph (1) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) with respect to the effects of prison rape, statistical, sociological, and psychological data;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Data adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In preparing the information specified in paragraph (2), the Attorney General shall use established statistical methods to adjust the data as necessary to account for differences among institutions in the representative sample, which are not related to the detection, prevention, reduction and punishment of prison rape, or which are outside the control of the State, prison, or prison system, in order to provide an accurate comparison among prisons. Such differences may include the mission, security level, size, and jurisdiction under which the prison operates. For each such adjustment made, the Attorney General shall identify and explain such adjustment in the report.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Categorization of prisons</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The report shall divide the prisons surveyed into three categories. One category shall be composed of all Federal and State prisons. The other two categories shall be defined by the Attorney General in order to compare similar institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contracts and grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out its duties under this section, the Attorney General may&mdash;</p>
