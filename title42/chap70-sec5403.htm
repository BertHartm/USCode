<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with such State or interstate agencies (including legislative committees) as he deems appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider whether any such proposed standard is reasonable for the particular type of manufactured home or for the geographic region for which it is prescribed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the probable effect of such standard on the cost of the manufactured home to the public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) consider the extent to which any such standard will contribute to carrying out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Coverage; exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exclude from the coverage of this chapter any structure which the manufacturer certifies, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, to be:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not designed to be moved once so erected or installed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) designed and manufactured to comply with a nationally recognized model building code or an equivalent local code, or with a State or local modular building code recognized as generally equivalent to building codes for site-built housing, or with minimum property standards adopted by the Secretary pursuant to title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]; and</p>

<!-- PDFPage:4837 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The energy conservation standards established under this subsection shall take into consideration the design and factory construction techniques of manufactured homes and shall provide for alternative practices that result in net estimated energy consumption equal to or less than the specified standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) New performance standards for hardboard siding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop a new standard for hardboard panel siding on manufactured housing taking into account durability, longevity, consumer's costs for maintenance and any other relevant information pursuant to subsection (e) of this section. The Secretary shall consult with the National Manufactured Home Advisory Council and the National Commission on Manufactured Housing in establishing the new standard. The new performance standard developed shall ensure the durability of hardboard sidings for at least a normal life of a mortgage with minimum maintenance required. Not later than 180 days from October 28, 1992, the Secretary shall update the standards for hardboard siding.</p>
