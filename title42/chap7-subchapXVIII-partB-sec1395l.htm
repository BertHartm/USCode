<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) OPD fee schedule increase factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the &ldquo;OPD fee schedule increase factor&rdquo; for services furnished in a year is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title to hospital discharges occurring during the fiscal year ending in such year, reduced by 1 percentage point for such factor for services furnished in each of 2000 and 2002. In applying the previous sentence for years beginning with 2000, the Secretary may substitute for the market basket percentage increase an annual percentage increase that is computed and applied with respect to covered OPD services furnished in a year in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase is determined and applied to inpatient hospital services for discharges occurring in a fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Apply payment proportion to remainder</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of payment is the amount so determined under subparagraph (B) multiplied by the pre-deductible payment percentage (as determined under paragraph (3)(E)) for the service or group and year involved, plus the amount of any reduction in the copayment amount attributable to paragraph (8)(C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Outlier adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for each covered OPD service (or group of services) for which a hospital's charges, adjusted to cost, exceed&mdash;</p>

If this paragraph is first applied to less than a full year, the previous sentence shall apply only to the portion of such year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicable percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;applicable percentage&rdquo; means a percentage specified by the Secretary up to (but not to exceed)&mdash;</p>
