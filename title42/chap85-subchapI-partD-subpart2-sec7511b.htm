<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Control techniques guidelines for VOC sources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall issue control techniques guide<!-- PDFPage:4757 -->lines, in accordance with section 7408 of this title, for 11 categories of stationary sources of VOC emissions for which such guidelines have not been issued as of November 15, 1990, not including the categories referred to in paragraphs (3) and (4) of subsection (b) of this section. The Administrator may issue such additional control techniques guidelines as the Administrator deems necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Existing and new CTGS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 36 months after November 15, 1990, and periodically thereafter, the Administrator shall review and, if necessary, update control technique guidance issued under section 7408 of this title before November 15, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In issuing the guidelines the Administrator shall give priority to those categories which the Administrator considers to make the most significant contribution to the formation of ozone air pollution in ozone nonattainment areas, including hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities which are permitted under subtitle C of the Solid Waste Disposal Act [42 U.S.C. 6921 et seq.]. Thereafter the Administrator shall periodically review and, if necessary, revise such guidelines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall issue control techniques guidelines in accordance with section 7408 of this title to reduce the aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from aerospace coatings and solvents. Such control techniques guidelines shall, at a minimum, be adequate to reduce aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from the application of such coatings and solvents to such level as the Administrator determines may be achieved through the adoption of best available control measures. Such control technology guidance shall provide for such reductions in such increments and on such schedules as the Administrator determines to be reasonable, but in no event later than 10 years after the final issuance of such control technology guidance. In developing control technology guidance under this subsection, the Administrator shall consult with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, and the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration with regard to the establishment of specifications for such coatings. In evaluating VOC reduction strategies, the guidance shall take into account the applicable requirements of section 7412 of this title and the need to protect stratospheric ozone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall issue control techniques guidelines in accordance with section 7408 of this title to reduce the aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds and PM&ndash;10 into the ambient air from paints, coatings, and solvents used in shipbuilding operations and ship repair. Such control techniques guidelines shall, at a minimum, be adequate to reduce aggregate emissions of volatile organic compounds and PM&ndash;10 into the ambient air from the removal or application of such paints, coatings, and solvents to such level as the Administrator determines may be achieved through the adoption of the best available control measures. Such control techniques guidelines shall provide for such reductions in such increments and on such schedules as the Administrator determines to be reasonable, but in no event later than 10 years after the final issuance of such control technology guidance. In developing control techniques guidelines under this subsection, the Administrator shall consult with the appropriate Federal agencies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Alternative control techniques</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 3 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall issue technical documents which identify alternative controls for all categories of stationary sources of volatile organic compounds and oxides of nitrogen which emit, or have the potential to emit 25 tons per year or more of such air pollutant. The Administrator shall revise and update such documents as the Administrator determines necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guidance for evaluating cost-effectiveness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after November 15, 1990, the Administrator shall provide guidance to the States to be used in evaluating the relative cost-effectiveness of various options for the control of emissions from existing stationary sources of air pollutants which contribute to nonattainment of the national ambient air quality standards for ozone.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Control of emissions from certain sources</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Best available controls</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;best available controls&rdquo; means the degree of emissions reduction that the Administrator determines, on the basis of technological and economic feasibility, health, environmental, and energy impacts, is achievable through the application of the most effective equipment, measures, processes, methods, systems or techniques, including chemical reformulation, product or feedstock substitution, repackaging, and directions for use, consumption, storage, or disposal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consumer or commercial product</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;consumer or commercial product&rdquo; means any substance, product (including paints, coatings, and solvents), or article (including any container or packaging) held by any person, the use, consumption, storage, disposal, destruction, or decomposition of which may result in the release of volatile organic compounds. The term does not include fuels or fuel additives regulated under section 7545 of this title, or motor vehicles, non-road vehicles, and non-road engines as defined under section 7550 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Regulated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;regulated entities&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, or importers of consumer or commercial products for sale or distribution in interstate commerce in the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) manufacturers, processors, wholesale distributors, or importers that supply the entities listed under clause (i) with such <!-- PDFPage:4758 -->products for sale or distribution in interstate commerce in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Study and report</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator shall conduct a study of the emissions of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air from consumer and commercial products (or any combination thereof) in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) determine their potential to contribute to ozone levels which violate the national ambient air quality standard for ozone; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) establish criteria for regulating consumer and commercial products or classes or categories thereof which shall be subject to control under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The study shall be completed and a report submitted to Congress not later than 3 years after November 15, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Consideration of certain factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the criteria under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Administrator shall take into consideration each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The uses, benefits, and commercial demand of consumer and commercial products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The health or safety functions (if any) served by such consumer and commercial products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Those consumer and commercial products which emit highly reactive volatile organic compounds into the ambient air.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Those consumer and commercial products which are subject to the most cost-effective controls.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) The availability of alternatives (if any) to such consumer and commercial products which are of comparable costs, considering health, safety, and environmental impacts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Regulations to require emission reductions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon submission of the final report under paragraph (2), the Administrator shall list those categories of consumer or commercial products that the Administrator determines, based on the study, account for at least 80 percent of the VOC emissions, on a reactivity-adjusted basis, from consumer or commercial products in areas that violate the NAAQS for ozone. Credit toward the 80 percent emissions calculation shall be given for emission reductions from consumer or commercial products made after November 15, 1990. At such time, the Administrator shall divide the list into 4 groups establishing priorities for regulation based on the criteria established in paragraph (2). Every 2 years after promulgating such list, the Administrator shall regulate one group of categories until all 4 groups are regulated. The regulations shall require best available controls as defined in this section. Such regulations may exempt health use products for which the Administrator determines there is no suitable substitute. In order to carry out this section, the Administrator may, by regulation, control or prohibit any activity, including the manufacture or introduction into commerce, offering for sale, or sale of any consumer or commercial product which results in emission of volatile organic compounds into the ambient air.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Regulated entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Regulations under this subsection may be imposed only with respect to regulated entities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Use of CTGS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For any consumer or commercial product the Administrator may issue control techniques guidelines under this chapter in lieu of regulations required under subparagraph (A) if the Administrator determines that such guidance will be substantially as effective as regulations in reducing emissions of volatile organic compounds which contribute to ozone levels in areas which violate the national ambient air quality standard for ozone.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Systems of regulation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The regulations under this subsection may include any system or systems of regulation as the Administrator may deem appropriate, including requirements for registration and labeling, self-monitoring and reporting, prohibitions, limitations, or economic incentives (including marketable permits and auctions of emissions rights) concerning the manufacture, processing, distribution, use, consumption, or disposal of the product.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Special fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any amounts collected by the Administrator under such regulations shall be deposited in a special fund in the United States Treasury for licensing and other services, which thereafter shall be available until expended, subject to annual appropriation Acts, solely to carry out the activities of the Administrator for which such fees, charges, or collections are established or made.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any regulation established under this subsection shall be treated, for purposes of enforcement of this chapter, as a standard under section 7411 of this title and any violation of such regulation shall be treated as a violation of a requirement of section 7411(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) State administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State may develop and submit to the Administrator a procedure under State law for implementing and enforcing regulations promulgated under this subsection. If the Administrator finds the State procedure is adequate, the Administrator shall approve such procedure. Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit the Administrator from enforcing any applicable regulations under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Size, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No regulations regarding the size, shape, or labeling of a product may be promulgated, unless the Administrator determines such regulations to be useful in meeting any national ambient air quality standard.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4759 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) State consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any State which proposes regulations other than those adopted under this subsection shall consult with the Administrator regarding whether any other State or local subdivision has promulgated or is promulgating regulations on any products covered under this part. The Administrator shall establish a clearinghouse of information, studies, and regulations proposed and promulgated regarding products covered under this subsection and disseminate such information collected as requested by State or local subdivisions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Tank vessel standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Schedule for standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Within 2 years after November 15, 1990, the Administrator, in consultation with the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating, shall promulgate standards applicable to the emission of VOCs and any other air pollutant from loading and unloading of tank vessels (as that term is defined in section 2101 of title 46) which the Administrator finds causes, or contributes to, air pollution that may be reasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare. Such standards shall require the application of reasonably available control technology, considering costs, any nonair-quality benefits, environmental impacts, energy requirements and safety factors associated with alternative control techniques. To the extent practicable such standards shall apply to loading and unloading facilities and not to tank vessels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any regulation prescribed under this subsection (and any revision thereof) shall take effect after such period as the Administrator finds (after consultation with the Secretary of the department&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7511b_1_target" name="7511b_1">1</a></sup> in which the Coast Guard is operating) necessary to permit the development and application of the requisite technology, giving appropriate consideration to the cost of compliance within such period, except that the effective date shall not be more than 2 years after promulgation of such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Regulations on equipment safety</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 6 months after November 15, 1990, the Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall issue regulations to ensure the safety of the equipment and operations which are to control emissions from the loading and unloading of tank vessels, under section 3703 of title 46 and section 1225 of title 33. The standards promulgated by the Administrator under paragraph (1) and the regulations issued by a State or political subdivision regarding emissions from the loading and unloading of tank vessels shall be consistent with the regulations regarding safety of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Agency authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Administrator shall ensure compliance with the tank vessel emission standards prescribed under paragraph (1)(A). The Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall also ensure compliance with the tank vessel standards prescribed under paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The Secretary of the Department in which the Coast Guard is operating shall ensure compliance with the regulations issued under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) State or local standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After the Administrator promulgates standards under this section, no State or political subdivision thereof may adopt or attempt to enforce any standard respecting emissions from tank vessels subject to regulation under paragraph (1) unless such standard is no less stringent than the standards promulgated under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any standard established under paragraph (1)(A) shall be treated, for purposes of enforcement of this chapter, as a standard under section 7411 of this title and any violation of such standard shall be treated as a violation of a requirement of section 7411(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Ozone design value study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall conduct a study of whether the methodology in use by the Environmental Protection Agency as of November 15, 1990, for establishing a design value for ozone provides a reasonable indicator of the ozone air quality of ozone nonattainment areas. The Administrator shall obtain input from States, local subdivisions thereof, and others. The study shall be completed and a report submitted to Congress not later than 3 years after November 15, 1990. The results of the study shall be subject to peer and public review before submitting it to Congress.</p>
