<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Health and Human Services (in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall identify current State practices that prohibit payment for health care-acquired conditions and shall incorporate the practices identified, or elements of such practices, which the Secretary determines appropriate for application to the Medicaid program in regulations. Such regulations shall be effective as of July 1, 2011, and shall prohibit payments to States under section 1903 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396b] for any amounts expended for providing medical assistance for health care-acquired conditions specified in the regulations. The regulations shall ensure that the prohibition on payment for health care-acquired conditions shall not result in a loss of access to care or services for Medicaid beneficiaries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Health care-acquired condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section.<sup><a href="#1396b-1_1_target" name="1396b-1_1">1</a></sup> the term &ldquo;health care-acquired condition&rdquo; means a medical condition for which an individual was diagnosed that could be identified by a secondary diagnostic code described in section 1886(d)(4)(D)(iv) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395ww(d)(4)(D)(iv)).</p>

The Secretary may exclude certain conditions identified under title XVIII of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.] for non-payment under title XIX of such Act when the Secretary finds the inclusion of such conditions to be inapplicable to beneficiaries under title XIX.</p>
