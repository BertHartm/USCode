<p class="statutory-body-1em">At the end of the primary term of a lease the Secretary shall renew for an additional 10-year term a lease that does not meet the requirements of paragraph (1) if the lessee submits to the Secretary an application for renewal not later than 60 days before the expiration of the primary lease and the lessee certifies, and the Secretary agrees, that hydrocarbon resources were discovered on one or more wells drilled on the leased land in such quantities that a prudent operator would hold the lease for potential future development.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No lease issued under this section covering lands capable of producing oil or gas in paying quantities shall expire because the lessee fails to produce the same due to circumstances beyond the control of the lessee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Unit agreements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

In determining the public interest, the Secretary should consider, among other things, the extent to which the unit agreement will minimize the impact to surface resources of the leases and will facilitate consolidation of facilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In making a determination under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall consult with and provide opportunities for participation by the State of Alaska or a Regional Corporation (as defined in section 1602 of title 43) with respect to the creation or expansion of units that include acreage in which the State of Alaska or the Regional Corporation has an interest in the mineral estate.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Applicability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph applies to a lease that is in effect on or after August 8, 2005..<sup><a href="#6506a_1_target" name="6506a_1">1</a></sup></p>
