<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to award demonstration grants to States for the development, implementation, and evaluation of alternatives to current tort litigation for resolving disputes over injuries allegedly caused by health care providers or health care organizations. In awarding such grants, the Secretary shall ensure the diversity of the alternatives so funded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Duration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may award grants under subsection (a) for a period not to exceed 5 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Conditions for demonstration grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State desiring a grant under subsection (a) shall develop an alternative to current tort litigation that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) allows for the resolution of disputes over injuries allegedly caused by health care providers or health care organizations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promotes a reduction of health care errors by encouraging the collection and <!-- PDFPage:464 -->analysis of patient safety data related to disputes resolved under subparagraph (A) by organizations that engage in efforts to improve patient safety and the quality of health care.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Alternative to current tort litigation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State desiring a grant under subsection (a) shall demonstrate how the proposed alternative described in paragraph (1)(A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) makes the medical liability system more reliable by increasing the availability of prompt and fair resolution of disputes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) encourages the efficient resolution of disputes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) encourages the disclosure of health care errors;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Sources of compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State desiring a grant under subsection (a) shall identify the sources from and methods by which compensation would be paid for claims resolved under the proposed alternative to current tort litigation, which may include public or private funding sources, or a combination of such sources.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Scope</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that make proposals that are likely to enhance patient safety by detecting, analyzing, and helping to reduce medical errors and adverse events; and</p>
