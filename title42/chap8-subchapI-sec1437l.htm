<p class="statutory-body">(D) The comprehensive plan, any amendments to the comprehensive plan, and the annual statement shall, once approved by the Secretary, be binding upon the Secretary and the public housing agency. The Secretary may order corrective action only if the public housing agency does not comply with subparagraph (A) or (B) or if an audit under subparagraph (C) reveals findings that the Secretary reasonably believes require such corrective action.

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">The Secretary may not establish or amend any criteria regarding the accrual needs of public housing agencies under this subparagraph, except by rule as provided under section 553 of title 5.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) In determining how many units an agency owns or operates and the relative modernization needs of agencies, the Secretary shall, except as otherwise agreed by the Secretary and the agency, count each existing unit under the annual contributions contract, except that an existing unit under the turnkey III and the mutual help programs may be counted as less than one unit, to take into account the responsibility of families for the costs of certain maintenance and repair. For purposes of this section, an agency that qualifies to receive a formula grant under paragraph (4) may elect to continue to qualify to receive a formula grant if it owns or operates at least 200 public housing units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Where an existing unit under a contract is demolished or disposed of, the Secretary shall not adjust the amount the agency receives under the formula unless more than one percent of the units are affected on a cumulative basis. Where more than one percent of the units are demolished or disposed of, the Secretary shall reduce the formula amount for the agency over a 3-year period to reflect removal of the units from the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Secretary shall determine whether the data under subparagraphs (B) and (C) are statistically reliable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount determined under the formula for agencies with fewer than 250 units shall be allocated in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The amount determined under the formula for each agency that owns or operates 250 or more units shall be allocated to each qualifying agency in accordance with subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) With respect to any agency that is designated as a troubled agency with respect to the program under this section upon the designation of such troubled agencies under section 1437d(j)(2)(A)(i) of this title, the Secretary shall limit the total amount of funding under this <!-- PDFPage:2235 -->section for the agency for fiscal year 1992 and any fiscal year thereafter, if the agency remains designated as a troubled agency, to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the average of the amount that the troubled agency received for modernization activities under this section and for major reconstruction of obsolete projects for each of the preceding three fiscal years, which average shall be adjusted to take into account changes in the cost of rehabilitating property; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) 25 percent of the difference between the amount determined under clause (i) and the amount that would be allocated to the agency in such fiscal year if the agency were not designated as a troubled agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) In determining whether an agency is &ldquo;troubled with respect to the modernization program&rdquo;, the Department shall consider only the agency's ability to carry out that program effectively based upon the agency's capacity to accomplish the physical work: (a) with decent quality; (b) in a timely manner; (c) under competent contract administration; and (d) with adequate budget controls. No other criteria shall be applied in the determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any fiscal year the Secretary may, pursuant to the request of a troubled agency, increase the amount allocated to the agency under subparagraph (A) to an amount not exceeding the amount that would be allocated to the agency in such fiscal year if the agency were not a troubled agency. An increase under this subparagraph shall be based on the agency's progress toward meeting the performance indicators under section 1437d(j)(1) of this title. The Secretary shall render a decision in writing on each such request not later than 75 days after receipt of the request and any necessary supporting documentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For any fiscal year, any amounts that would have been allocated to an agency under the formula under paragraph (2) that are not allocated to the agency because the agency receives the amount provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, shall be allocated in such year pursuant to the formula to other agencies with 250 or more units.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) The Secretary shall carry out a credit system under this subparagraph to provide agencies that receive allocations under subparagraph (A) with additional assistance under this section after the agency is determined not to be a troubled agency, to compensate for amounts not received because of the troubled agency designation. The credit system shall be subject to the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) Any agency that receives assistance pursuant to subparagraph (A) for any fiscal year shall receive credits for the difference between the amount that the agency would have been allocated in such year if it were not designated a troubled agency and the amount allocated for the agency for such year under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) An agency may not receive credits under this subparagraph for more than 3 consecutive fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) After a 3-year period during which an agency has accrued credits, the credits accrued by the agency shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) decreased by 10 percent of the total credits accumulated if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the first fiscal year after such 3-year period of accrual of credits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) decreased by an additional 20 percent of the original total accumulated credits if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the second fiscal year after such 3-year accrual period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) decreased by an additional 30 percent of the original total accumulated credits if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the third fiscal year after such 3-year accrual period; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) eliminated if the designation as a troubled agency is not removed before the conclusion of the fourth fiscal year after such 3-year accrual period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) After a determination by the Secretary that an agency is not a troubled agency, the Secretary shall provide the agency with amounts made available under this clause in accordance with the amount of credits accumulated by the agency (subject to the reductions under clause (iii)). Such amounts shall be provided in addition to the amounts allocated to the agency pursuant to the formula under paragraph (2). In each fiscal year, the Secretary shall reserve from amounts available for allocation under paragraph (2)(A) the amount necessary to provide assistance pursuant to such credits, except that the reserved amount may not exceed 5 percent of the total amount available for allocation under such paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) In making payments for accrued credits in accordance with clause (iv), the Secretary may take into account the ability of the agency to expeditiously expend amounts received for credits.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any amounts (A) allocated under paragraph (4) that become available for reallocation because an agency does not qualify to receive all or a part of its formula allocation due to failure to comply with the requirements of this section (other than because of designation as a troubled agency), and (B) recaptured by the Secretary for good cause, shall (subject to approval in appropriations Acts) be reallocated by the Secretary in the next fiscal year to other housing agencies that own or operate 250 or more units, based on their relative needs. The relative needs of agencies shall be measured by the formula established pursuant to paragraph (2)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) A public housing agency may appeal the amount of its allocation determined under the formula on the basis of unique circumstances or on the basis that the objectively measurable data regarding the agency, community, and project characteristics used for determining the formula amount were not correct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Amounts allocated to a public housing agency under paragraph (3) or (4) may be used for any eligible activity in accordance with this section, notwithstanding that the allocation amount is determined by allocating half based on relative backlog needs and half based on relative accrued needs of agencies.</p>
