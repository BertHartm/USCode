<p class="statutory-body">An electric utility is subject to this subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8484_1_target" name="8484_1">1</a></sup> if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the utility owns or operates any existing electric powerplant in which natural gas was used as a primary energy source at any time during the 1-year period ending on August 13, 1981, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the utility plans to use natural gas as a primary energy source in any electric powerplant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Submission and approval of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall require each electric utility subject to this section to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) submit, within 1 year after August 13, 1981, and have approved by the Secretary, a conservation plan which meets the requirements of subsection (c) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) implement such plan during the 5-year period beginning on the date of the initial approval of such plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contents of plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any conservation plan under this section shall set forth means determined by the utility to achieve conservation of electric energy not later than the 5th year after its initial approval at a level, measured on an annual basis, at least equal to 10 percent of the electric energy output of that utility during the most recent 4 calendar quarters ending prior to August 13, 1981, which is attributable to natural gas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The conservation plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all activities required for such utility by part 1 of title II of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 8211 et seq.];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an effective public information program for conservation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such other measures as the utility may consider appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any such plan may set forth a program for the use of renewable energy sources (other than hydroelectric power).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any such plan shall contain procedures to permit the amounts expended by such utility in developing and implementing the plan to be recovered in a manner specified by the appropriate State regulatory authority (or by the utility in the case of a nonregulated utility).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Plan approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, by order, approve or disapprove any conservation plan proposed under this subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8484_1_target" name="8484_1">1</a></sup> by an electric utility within 120 days after its submission. The Secretary shall approve any such proposed plan unless the Secretary finds that such plan does not meet the requirements of subsection (c) of this section and states in writing the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event the Secretary disapproves under paragraph (1) the plan originally submitted, the Secretary shall provide a reasonable period of time for resubmission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An electric utility may amend any approved plan, except that the plan as amended shall be subject to approval in accordance with paragraph (1).</p>
