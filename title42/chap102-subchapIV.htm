<!-- PDFPage:6038 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) obligate a program or facility to provide treatment services to any person who is admitted to such program or facility solely for diagnostic or evaluative purposes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In order to assist a person admitted to a program or facility in the exercise or protection of such person's rights, such person's attorney or legal representatives should have reasonable access to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) such person;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), in the case of a person admitted to a program or facility for the purpose of receiving mental health services, no individual employed by or receiving any remuneration from such program or facility should act as such person's guardian or representative.</p>
