<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the policy of the Federal Government that the responsibilities of the States under section 2021c of this title for the disposal of low-level radioactive waste can be most safely and effectively managed on a regional basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Interstate compacts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To carry out the policy set forth in paragraph (1), the States may enter into such compacts as may be necessary to provide for the establishment and operation of regional disposal facilities for low-level radioactive waste.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Federal low-level radioactive waste disposed of at non-Federal facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Low-level radioactive waste owned or generated by the Federal Government that is disposed of at a regional disposal facility or non-Federal disposal facility within a State that is not a member of a compact shall be subject to the same conditions, regulations, requirements, fees, taxes, and surcharges imposed by the compact commission, and by the State in which such facility is located, in the same manner and to the same extent as any low-level radioactive waste not generated by the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Federal low-level radioactive waste disposal facilities</h4>
