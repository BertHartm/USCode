<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in 1978, an estimated one million one hundred thousand teenagers became pregnant, more than five hundred thousand teenagers carried their babies to term, and over one-half of the babies born to such teenagers were born out of wedlock;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) adolescents aged seventeen and younger accounted for more than one-half of the out of wedlock births to teenagers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in a high proportion of cases, the pregnant adolescent is herself the product of an unmarried parenthood during adolescence and is continuing the pattern in her own lifestyle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it is estimated that approximately 80 per centum of unmarried teenagers who carry their pregnancies to term live with their families before and during their pregnancy and remain with their families after the birth of the child;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) pregnancy and childbirth among unmarried adolescents, particularly young adolescents, often results in severe adverse health, social, and economic consequences including: a higher percentage of pregnancy and childbirth complications; a higher incidence of low birth weight babies; a higher infant mortality and morbidity; a greater likelihood that an adolescent marriage will end in divorce; a decreased likelihood of completing schooling; and higher risks of unemployment and welfare dependency; and therefore, education, training, and job research services are important for adolescent parents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A) adoption is a positive option for unmarried pregnant adolescents who are unwilling or unable to care for their children since adoption is a means of providing permanent families for such children from available approved couples who are unable or have difficulty in conceiving or carrying children of their own to term; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at present, only 4 per centum of unmarried pregnant adolescents who carry their babies to term enter into an adoption plan or arrange for their babies to be cared for by relatives or friends;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) an unmarried adolescent who becomes pregnant once is likely to experience recurrent pregnancies and childbearing, with increased risks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8)(A) the problems of adolescent premarital sexual relations, pregnancy, and parenthood are multiple and complex and are frequently associated with or are a cause of other troublesome situations in the family; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such problems are best approached through a variety of integrated and essential services provided to adolescents and their families by other family members, religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups in the private sector as well as services provided by publicly sponsored initiatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) a wide array of educational, health, and supportive services are not available to adolescents with such problems or to their families, or when available frequently are fragmented and thus are of limited effectiveness in discouraging adolescent premarital sexual relations and the consequences of such relations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10)(A) prevention of adolescent sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy depends primarily upon developing strong family values and close family ties, and since the family is the basic social unit in which the values and attitudes of adolescents concerning sexuality and pregnancy are formed, programs designed to deal with issues of sexuality and pregnancy will be successful to the extent that such programs encourage and sustain the role of the family in dealing with adolescent sexual activity and adolescent pregnancy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Federal policy therefore should encourage the development of appropriate health, educational, and social services where such services are now lacking or inadequate, and the better coordination of existing services where they are available; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) services encouraged by the Federal Government should promote the involvement of parents with their adolescent children, and should emphasize the provision of support by other family members, religious and charitable organizations, voluntary associations, and other groups in the private sector in order to help adolescents and their families deal with complex issues of adolescent premarital sexual relations and the consequences of such relations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11)(A) there has been limited research concerning the societal causes and consequences of adolescent pregnancy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is limited knowledge concerning which means of intervention are effective in mediating or eliminating adolescent premarital sexual relations and adolescent pregnancy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) it is necessary to expand and strengthen such knowledge in order to develop an array of approaches to solving the problems of adolescent premarital sexual relations and adolescent pregnancy in both urban and rural settings.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Therefore, the purposes of this subchapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to find effective means, within the context of the family, of reaching adolescents before they become sexually active in order to maximize the guidance and support available to adolescents from parents and other family members, and to promote self discipline and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital sexual relations, including adolescent pregnancy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to promote adoption as an alternative for adolescent parents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to establish innovative, comprehensive, and integrated approaches to the delivery of care services both for pregnant adolescents, with primary emphasis on unmarried adolescents who are seventeen years of age or under, and for adolescent parents, which shall be based upon an assessment of existing programs and, where appropriate, upon efforts to <!-- PDFPage:946 -->establish better coordination, integration, and linkages among such existing programs in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) enable pregnant adolescents to obtain proper care and assist pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents to become productive independent contributors to family and community life; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) assist families of adolescents to understand and resolve the societal causes which are associated with adolescent pregnancy;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to encourage and support research projects and demonstration projects concerning the societal causes and consequences of adolescent premarital sexual relations, contraceptive use, pregnancy, and child rearing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to support evaluative research to identify effective services which alleviate, eliminate, or resolve any negative consequences of adolescent premarital sexual relations and adolescent childbearing for the parents, the child, and their families; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to encourage and provide for the dissemination of results, findings, and information from programs and research projects relating to adolescent premarital sexual relations, pregnancy, and parenthood.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Covered projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, funds provided for demonstration projects for services under this subchapter may be used by grantees only to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide to eligible persons&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) care services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) prevention services; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) coordinate, integrate, and provide linkages among providers of care, prevention, and other services for eligible persons in furtherance of the purposes of this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide supplemental services where such services are not adequate or not available to eligible persons in the community and which are essential to the care of pregnant adolescents and to the prevention of adolescent premarital sexual relations and adolescent pregnancy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) plan for the administration and coordination of pregnancy prevention services and programs of care for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents which will further the objectives of this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) fulfill assurances required for grant approval by section 300z&ndash;5 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Family planning services; availability in community</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No funds provided for a demonstration project for services under this subchapter may be used for the provision of family planning services (other than counseling and referral services) to adolescents unless appropriate family planning services are not otherwise available in the community.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any grantee who receives funds for a demonstration project for services under this subchapter and who, after determining under paragraph (1) that appropriate family planning services are not otherwise available in the community, provides family planning services (other than counseling and referral services) to adolescents may only use funds provided under this subchapter for such family planning services if all funds received by such grantee from all other sources to support such family planning services are insufficient to support such family planning services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Fees for services: criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Grantees who receive funds for a demonstration project for services under this subchapter shall charge fees for services pursuant to a fee schedule approved by the Secretary as a part of the application described in section 300z&ndash;5 of this title which bases fees charged by the grant<!-- PDFPage:948 -->ee on the income of the eligible person or the parents or legal guardians of the eligible person and takes into account the difficulty adolescents face in obtaining resources to pay for services. A grantee who receives funds for a demonstration project for services under this subchapter may not, in any case, discriminate with regard to the provision of services to any individual because of that individual's inability to provide payment for such services, except that in determining the ability of an unemancipated minor to provide payment for services, the income of the family of an unemancipated minor shall be considered in determining the ability of such minor to make such payments unless the parents or guardians of the unemancipated minor refuse to make such payments.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In approving applications for grants for demonstration projects for services under this subchapter, the Secretary shall give priority to applicants who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) serve an area where there is a high incidence of adolescent pregnancy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) serve an area with a high proportion of low-income families and where the availability of programs of care for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents is low;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) show evidence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of an applicant who will provide care services, of having the ability to bring together a wide range of needed core services and, as appropriate, supplemental services in comprehensive single-site projects, or to establish a well-integrated network of such services (appropriate for the target population and geographic area to be served including the special needs of rural areas) for pregnant adolescents or adolescent parents; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an applicant who will provide prevention services, of having the ability to provide prevention services for adolescents and their families which are appropriate for the target population and the geographic area to be served, including the special needs of rural areas;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will utilize to the maximum extent feasible existing available programs and facilities such as neighborhood and primary health care centers, maternity homes which provide or can be equipped to provide services to pregnant adolescents, agencies serving families, youth, and children with established programs of service to pregnant adolescents and vulnerable families, licensed adoption agencies, children and youth centers, maternal and infant health centers, regional rural health facilities, school and other educational programs, mental health programs, nutrition programs, recreation programs, and other ongoing pregnancy prevention services and programs of care for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) make use, to the maximum extent feasible, of other Federal, State, and local funds, programs, contributions, and other third-party reimbursements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) can demonstrate a community commitment to the program by making available to the demonstration project non-Federal funds, personnel, and facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) have involved the community to be served, including public and private agencies, adolescents, and families, in the planning and implementation of the demonstration project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) will demonstrate innovative and effective approaches in addressing the problems of adolescent premarital sexual relations, pregnancy, or parenthood, including approaches to provide pregnant adolescents with adequate information about adoption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors to be considered in making grants; special needs of rural areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of a grant for a demonstration project for services under this subchapter shall be determined by the Secretary, based on factors such as the incidence of adolescent pregnancy in the geographic area to be served, and the adequacy of pregnancy prevention services and programs of care for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making grants for demonstration projects for services under this subchapter, the Secretary shall consider the special needs of rural areas and, to the maximum extent practicable, shall distribute funds taking into consideration the relative number of adolescents in such areas in need of such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Duration; Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A grantee may not receive funds for a demonstration project for services under this subchapter for a period in excess of 5 years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to paragraph (3), a grant for a demonstration project for services under this subchapter may not exceed&mdash;</p>
