<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Environmental aircraft research and development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may establish an initiative with the objective of developing, and demonstrating in a relevant environment, technologies to enable the following commercial aircraft performance characteristics:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Noise</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Noise levels on takeoff and on airport approach and landing that do not exceed ambient noise levels in the absence of flight operations in the vicinity of airports from which such commercial aircraft would normally operate.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Energy consumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Twenty-five percent reduction in the energy required for medium- to long-range flights, compared to aircraft in commercial service as of December 30, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Emissions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nitrogen oxides on take-off and landing that are significantly reduced, without adversely affecting hydrocarbons and smoke, relative to aircraft in commercial service as of December 30, 2005.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supersonic transport research and development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may establish an initiative with the objective of developing and demonstrating, in a relevant environment, airframe and propulsion technologies to enable efficient, economical overland flight of supersonic civil transport aircraft with no significant impact on the environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Rotorcraft and other runway-independent air vehicles</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may establish a rotorcraft and other runway-independent air vehicles initiative with the objective of developing and demonstrating improved safety, noise, and environmental impact in a relevant environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Hypersonics research</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may establish a hypersonics research program with the objective of exploring the science and technology of hypersonic flight using air-breathing propulsion concepts, through a mix of theoretical work, basic and applied research, and development of flight research demonstration vehicles. The program may also include the transition to the hypersonic range of Mach 3 to Mach 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Revolutionary aeronautical concepts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator may establish a research program which covers a unique range of subsonic, fixed wing vehicles and propulsion concepts. This research is intended to push technology barriers beyond current subsonic technology. Propulsion concepts include advanced materials, morphing engines, hybrid engines, and fuel cells.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Fuel cell-powered aircraft research</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may establish a fuel-cell powered aircraft research program whose objective shall be to develop and test concepts to enable a hydrogen fuel cell-powered aircraft that would have no hydrocarbon or nitrogen oxide emissions into the environment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Approach</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may establish a program of competitively awarded grants available to teams of researchers that may include the participation of individuals from universities, industry, and government for the conduct of this research.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:7119 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Mars aircraft research</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may establish a Mars Aircraft project whose objective shall be to develop and test concepts for an uncrewed aircraft that could operate for sustained periods in the atmosphere of Mars.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Approach</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator may establish a program of competitively awarded grants available to teams of researchers that may include the participation of individuals from universities, industry, and government for the conduct of this research.</p>
