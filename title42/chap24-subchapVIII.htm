<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Annual assistance payments; extensions; determination of amount and recipient</h4>

In determining the amount and recipient of such payments the Administrator shall consider&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) has a special burden due to the requirements under law imposed upon it in assisting in effectuating the purposes of this chapter for which it will not otherwise receive adequate compensation or revenues; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will suffer a tax loss or lapse in place of which it will not receive any other adequate revenues until the new governmental entities contemplated by this subchapter are receiving their normal taxes and performing their normal functions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payments for special burdens</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments made under this section shall be payments made for special burdens imposed on the local governmental entities in accordance with the second sentence of section 2208 of this title.

If the recommendation under the preceding sentence regarding the Los Alamos School Board or the county of Los Alamos, New Mexico, indicates a need for further assistance for the school board or the county, as the case may be, after June 30, 1997, the recommendation shall include a report and plan describing the actions required to eliminate the need for further assistance for the school board or the county, including a proposal for legislative action to carry out the plan.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3225 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reduction or termination of assistance payments; determination by Administrator of financial self-sufficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In exercising the authority of subsection (a) of this section the Administrator shall assure that the governmental or other entities receiving assistance hereunder utilize all reasonable, available means to achieve financial self-sufficiency to the end that assistance payments by the Administrator may be reduced or terminated at the earliest practical time.</p>
