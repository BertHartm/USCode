In determining the amount and recipient of such payments the Administrator shall consider&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will suffer a tax loss or lapse in place of which it will not receive any other adequate revenues until the new governmental entities contemplated by this subchapter are receiving their normal taxes and performing their normal functions.</p>
