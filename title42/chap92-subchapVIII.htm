<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Contents of plan</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The conservation plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) all activities required for such utility by part 1 of title II of the National Energy Conservation Policy Act [42 U.S.C. 8211 et seq.];</p>
