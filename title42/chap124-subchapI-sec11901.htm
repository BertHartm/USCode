<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Federal Government has a duty to provide public and other federally assisted low-income housing that is decent, safe, and free from illegal drugs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) public and other federally assisted low-income housing in many areas suffers from rampant drug-related or violent crime;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) drug dealers are increasingly imposing a reign of terror on public and other federally assisted low-income housing tenants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the increase in drug-related and violent crime not only leads to murders, muggings, and other forms of violence against tenants, but also to a deterioration of the physical environment that requires substantial government expenditures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) local law enforcement authorities often lack the resources to deal with the drug problem in public and other federally assisted low-income housing, particularly in light of the recent reductions in Federal aid to cities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the Federal Government should provide support for effective safety and security measures to combat drug-related and violent crime, primarily in and around public housing projects with severe crime problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) closer cooperation should be encouraged between public and assisted housing managers, local law enforcement agencies, and residents in developing and implementing anti-crime programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) anti-crime strategies should be improved through the expansion of community-oriented policing initiatives.</p>
