<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Permanent exemption due to lack of alternate fuel supply, site limitations, environmental requirements, or adequate capital</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption for a powerplant from the prohibitions of part A, the Secretary shall, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection with respect to <!-- PDFPage:5814 -->natural gas or petroleum, if he finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that despite diligent good faith efforts&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) it is likely that an adequate and reliable supply of coal or other alternate fuel of the quality necessary to conform with design and operational requirements for use as a primary energy source (i) will not be available within the first 10 years of the useful life of the powerplant, or (ii) will not be available at a cost (taking into account associated facilities for the transportation and use of such fuel) which, based upon the best practicable estimates, does not substantially exceed the cost, as determined by rule by the Secretary, of the fuel that would be used as a primary energy source during the useful life of the powerplant involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) one or more site limitations exist which would not permit the location or operation of such powerplant using coal or any other alternate fuel as a primary energy source;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the prohibitions of part A could not be satisfied without violating applicable environmental requirements; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the required use of coal or any other alternate fuel would not allow the petitioner to obtain adequate capital for the financing of such powerplant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The demonstration required to be made by a petitioner under paragraph (1) shall be made with respect to the site of such powerplant and reasonable alternative sites.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Permanent exemption due to certain State or local requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption for a powerplant from the prohibitions of part A, the Secretary may, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection with respect to natural gas or petroleum, if he finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) with respect to the proposed site of the powerplant, the construction or operation of such a facility using coal or any other alternate fuel is infeasible because of a State or local requirement (other than a building code or a nuisance or zoning law);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is no reasonable alternative site for such powerplant which meets the criteria set forth in subsection (a)(1)(A) through (D) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the granting of the exemption would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Permanent exemption for cogeneration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption from one or more of the prohibitions of part A for a cogeneration facility, the Secretary may, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection with respect to natural gas or petroleum, if he&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that economic and other benefits of cogeneration are unobtainable unless petroleum or natural gas, or both, are used in such facility, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) includes in the final order a statement of the basis for such finding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount of the petroleum or natural gas used in such mixture will not exceed the minimum percentage of the total Btu heat input of the primary energy sources of such powerplant needed to maintain reliability of operation of such powerplant consistent with maintaining a reasonable level of fuel efficiency, as determined in accordance with rules prescribed by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Permanent exemption for emergency purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption from one or more of the prohibitions of part A for a powerplant, the Secretary shall, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection with respect to natural gas or petroleum, if he finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that such powerplant will be maintained and operated only for emergency purposes (as defined by rule by the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Permanent exemption for powerplants necessary to maintain reliability of service</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After consideration of a petition (and comments thereon) for an exemption for a powerplant from one or more of the prohibitions of part A, the Secretary may, by order, grant a permanent exemption under this subsection with respect to natural gas or petroleum if he finds that the petitioner has demonstrated that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) such exemption is necessary to prevent impairment of reliability of service, and</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 403(b) of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 3318; Public Law 95&ndash;620) [42 U.S.C. 8373(b)] and Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, in order to encourage additional conservation of petroleum and natural gas by recipients of Federal financial assistance, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;101. Each Federal agency, as that term is defined in Section 103(a)(25) of the Powerplant and Industrial Fuel Use Act of 1978 (92 Stat. 3297) [42 U.S.C. 8302(a)(25)], shall effectuate through its financial assistance programs the purposes of that Act relating to the conservation of petroleum and natural gas.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;102. Each Federal agency which extends financial assistance shall review those programs of financial assistance and identify those which are most likely to offer opportunities for significant conservation of petroleum and natural gas.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;103. Within two months, and annually thereafter, each agency shall publish for comment a list of those programs which it has identified as likely to offer significant opportunity for conservation. The public shall be given 60 days to submit comments, including suggestions for rules which would effectuate the conservation purposes of the Act [see Short Title note set out under 42 U.S.C. 8301].</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;104. After receiving public comment and suggestions, and after consulting with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, each agency shall publish proposed rules designed to achieve conservation of petroleum and natural gas in connection with the receipt of financial assistance.</p>

The conservation rules shall be used to enforce other new ways of achieving the purposes of the Act related to the conservation of petroleum and natural gas.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;110. In order to assess the effectiveness of this program, each agency shall annually prepare a report on its activities in accord with Section 403(b)(1)(B) of the Act [42 U.S.C. 8373(b)]. These reports shall be submitted to the President through the Secretary of Energy.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Right to transfer contractual interests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If any person receives natural gas, the use of which is prohibited by the provisions of subchapter III of this chapter or any rule or order thereunder, and if such natural gas is received pursuant to a contract in effect on April 20, 1977, between such person and any other person, such person receiving such natural gas may transfer all or any portion of such person's contractual interests under such contract and receive consideration from the person to whom such contractual interests are transferred. The consideration authorized by this subsection shall not exceed the maximum consideration established as just compensation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person who would have transported or distributed the natural gas subject to a contract with respect to which contractual interests are transferred pursuant to paragraph (1) shall be entitled to receive just compensation (as determined by the Commission) from the person to whom such contractual interests are transferred.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5833 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commission shall, by rule, establish guidelines for the application on a regional or national basis (as may be appropriate) of the criteria specified in subsection (e)(1) of this section to determine the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The person transferring contractual interests pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section and the person to whom such interests are transferred may agree on the amount of, or method of determining, the consideration to be paid for such transfer and certify such consideration to the Commission. Except as provided in paragraph (4), such agreed-upon consideration shall not exceed the consideration determined by application of the guidelines prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the event the person transferring contractual interests pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section and the person to whom such interests are to be transferred fail to agree, under paragraph (2), on the amount of, or method of determining, the consideration to be paid for such transfer, the Commission may, at the request of both such persons, prescribe the amount of, or method of determining, such consideration. Upon the request of either such person, the Commission shall make such determination on the record, after an opportunity for agency hearing. In any such latter case, the determination of the Commission shall be binding upon the party requesting that such determination be made on the record of the agency hearing. The consideration prescribed by the Commission shall not exceed the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section. In prescribing the amount of, or method of determining, consideration under this paragraph, to the maximum extent practicable, the Commission shall utilize any liquidated damages provision set forth in the applicable contract, but in no event may the Commission prescribe consideration in excess of the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the event that the consideration agreed upon under paragraph (2) exceeds the consideration determined by application of the guidelines prescribed by the Commission under paragraph (1), the Commission may approve such agreed-upon consideration if the Commission determines such agreed-upon consideration does not exceed the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If consideration is agreed upon under paragraph (2) and such consideration exceeds the consideration determined by application of the guidelines prescribed under paragraph (1), but does not exceed the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section, the Commission may not require a refund of any portion of the agreed-upon consideration paid with respect to deliveries of natural gas occurring prior to the Commission's action under paragraph (4) approving or disapproving such consideration unless the Commission determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such agreed-upon consideration was fraudulently established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the processing of the request for approval of such agreed-upon consideration under paragraph (4) was willfully delayed by a party to the transfer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such agreed-upon consideration exceeds the maximum consideration permitted as just compensation under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restrictions on transfers unenforceable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any provision of any contract, which prohibits any transfer authorized by subsection (a)(1) of this section or terminates such contract on the basis of such transfer, shall be unenforceable in any court of the United States and in any court of any State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No State may enforce any prohibition on any transfer authorized by subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Contractual obligations unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The person acquiring contractual interests transferred pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section shall assume the contractual obligations which the person transferring such contractual interests has under such contract. This subsection shall not relieve the person transferring such contractual interests from any contractual obligation of such person under such contract if such obligation is not performed by the person acquiring such contractual interests.</p>
