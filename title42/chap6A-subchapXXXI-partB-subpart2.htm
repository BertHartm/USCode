<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) limit the number of certifications provided under paragraph (2)(B)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) in accordance with such subparagraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) to such number, as determined by the Administrator based on the best available information and subject to amounts made available under section 300mm&ndash;61 of this title, that will ensure sufficient funds will be available to provide treatment and monitoring benefits under this subchapter, with respect to all individuals receiving such certifications through the end of fiscal year 2020; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide priority in such certifications in the order in which individuals apply for a determination under paragraph (2)(B).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a screening-eligible WTC survivor, the WTC Program shall provide for an initial health evaluation to determine if the survivor has a WTC-related health condition and is eligible for followup monitoring and treatment benefits under the WTC Program.
