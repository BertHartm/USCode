<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall establish, by rule or regulation, a detailed system of reasonable and fair priority rights applicable to the sale of Government-owned property to private purchasers at each community. The priorities shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(a) be uniform in each class or subclass of property;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(b) give such preference to occupants and project-connected persons and to incoming employees of the Commission, of a contractor, or of a licensee as the Commission finds necessary or desirable, giving due consideration to the following factors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(1) The retention and recruitment of personnel essential to the atomic energy program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(2) The minimization of dislocations within the community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(3) The expeditious accomplishment of the disposal program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(4) The desirability of encouraging private firms to locate or remain in the community;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(c) give the occupant of a Government-owned single family house, and the senior occupant of a duplex house, at least ninety days in which to exercise the first right of priority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(d) permit persons who have formerly been occupants, project-connected persons, or inhabitants of the community, upon application therefor, to have such priority as the Commission finds to be fair and equitable; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(e) not impair any rights, including purchase rights, conferred by existing leases and covenants.</p>
