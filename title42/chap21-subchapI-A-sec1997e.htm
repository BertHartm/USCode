<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of administrative remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No action shall be brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility until such administrative remedies as are available are exhausted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Failure of State to adopt or adhere to administrative grievance procedure</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The failure of a State to adopt or adhere to an administrative grievance procedure shall not constitute the basis for an action under section 1997a or 1997c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Dismissal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The court shall on its own motion or on the motion of a party dismiss any action brought with respect to prison conditions under section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility if the court is satisfied that the action is frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the event that a claim is, on its face, frivolous, malicious, fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, or seeks monetary relief from a defendant who is immune from such relief, the court may dismiss the underlying claim without first requiring the exhaustion of administrative remedies.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Attorney's fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any action brought by a prisoner who is confined to any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, in which attorney's fees are authorized under section 1988&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1997e_1_target" name="1997e_1">1</a></sup> of this title, such fees shall not be awarded, except to the extent that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in proving an actual violation of the plaintiff's rights protected by a statute pursuant to which a fee may be awarded under section 1988&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1997e_1_target" name="1997e_1">1</a></sup> of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) the amount of the fee is proportionately related to the court ordered relief for the violation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the fee was directly and reasonably incurred in enforcing the relief ordered for the violation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever a monetary judgment is awarded in an action described in paragraph (1), a portion of the judgment (not to exceed 25 percent) shall be applied to satisfy the amount of attorney's fees awarded against the defendant. If the award of attorney's fees is not greater than 150 percent of the judgment, the excess shall be paid by the defendant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No award of attorney's fees in an action described in paragraph (1) shall be based on an hourly rate greater than 150 percent of the hourly rate established under section 3006A of title 18 for payment of court-appointed counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Nothing in this subsection shall prohibit a prisoner from entering into an agreement to pay an attorney's fee in an amount greater than the amount authorized under this subsection, if the fee is paid by the individual rather than by the defendant pursuant to section 1988&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1997e_1_target" name="1997e_1">1</a></sup> of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on recovery</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No Federal civil action may be brought by a prisoner confined in a jail, prison, or other correctional facility, for mental or emotional injury suffered while in custody without a prior showing of physical injury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Hearings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To the extent practicable, in any action brought with respect to prison conditions in Federal court pursuant to section 1983 of this title, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility, pretrial proceedings in which the prisoner's participation is required or permitted shall be conducted by telephone, video conference, or other telecommunications technology without removing the prisoner from the facility in which the prisoner is confined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to the agreement of the official of the Federal, State, or local unit of government with custody over the prisoner, hearings may be conducted at the facility in which the prisoner is confined. To the extent practicable, the court shall allow counsel to participate by telephone, video conference, or other communications technology in any hearing held at the facility.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3121 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Waiver of reply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any defendant may waive the right to reply to any action brought by a prisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correctional facility under section 1983 of this title or any other Federal law. Notwithstanding any other law or rule of procedure, such waiver shall not constitute an admission of the allegations contained in the complaint. No relief shall be granted to the plaintiff unless a reply has been filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The court may require any defendant to reply to a complaint brought under this section if it finds that the plaintiff has a reasonable opportunity to prevail on the merits.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &ldquo;Prisoner&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;prisoner&rdquo; means any person incarcerated or detained in any facility who is accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law or the terms and conditions of parole, probation, pretrial release, or diversionary program.</p>

<p class="note-body">Section 1988 of this title, referred to in subsec. (d)(1), (4), was in the original a reference to section 2 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (42 U.S.C. 1988), and has been translated as reading section 722 of the Revised Statutes of the United States to reflect the probable intent of Congress. Section 2 of the Revised Statutes, which defined the term &ldquo;county&rdquo;, was repealed and reenacted as section 2 of Title 1, General Provisions, by act July 30, 1947, ch. 388, 61 Stat. 633, 640.</p>
