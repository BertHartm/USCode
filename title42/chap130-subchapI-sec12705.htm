<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may provide for the submission of abbreviated housing strategies by jurisdictions that are not otherwise expected to be participating jurisdictions under subchapter II of this chapter. Such an abbreviated housing strategy shall be appropriate to the types and amounts of assistance the jurisdiction is to receive as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Approval</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall review the housing strategy upon receipt. Not later than 60 days after receipt by the Secretary, the housing strategy shall be approved unless the Secretary determines before that date that (A) the housing strategy is inconsistent with the purposes of this Act, or (B) the information described in subsection (b) of this section has not been provided in a substantially complete manner. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, the adoption or continuation of a public policy identified pursuant to subsection (b)(4) of this section shall not be a basis for the Sec<!-- PDFPage:6540 -->retary's disapproval of a housing strategy. During the 18-month period following November 28, 1990, the Secretary may extend the review period to not longer than 90 days.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Actions in case of disapproval</h4>

Not later than 15 days after the Secretary's disapproval, the Secretary shall inform the jurisdiction in writing of (A) the reasons for disapproval, and (B) actions that the jurisdiction could take to meet the criteria for approval. If the Secretary fails to inform the jurisdiction of the reasons for disapproval within such 15-day period, the housing strategy shall be deemed to have been approved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amendments and resubmission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, for a period of not less than 45 days following the date of first disapproval, permit amendments to, or the resubmission of, any housing strategy that is disapproved. The Secretary shall approve or disapprove a housing strategy not less than 30 days after receipt of such amendments or resubmission.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination of State and local housing strategies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may establish such requirements as the Secretary deems appropriate to encourage coordination between and among the housing strategies of a State and any participating jurisdictions within the State, except that a unit of general local government shall not be required to have elements of its housing strategy approved by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Consultation with social service agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When preparing a housing strategy for submission under this section, a jurisdiction shall make reasonable efforts to confer with appropriate social service agencies regarding the housing needs of children, elderly persons, persons with disabilities, homeless persons, and other persons served by such agencies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Lead-based paint hazards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">When preparing that portion of a housing strategy required by subsection (b)(16) of this section, a jurisdiction shall consult with State or local health and child welfare agencies and examine existing data related to lead-based paint hazards and poisonings, including health department data on the addresses of housing units in which children have been identified as lead poisoned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Barrier removal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 4 months after completion of the final report of the Secretary's Advisory Commission on Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing, the Secretary shall submit to the Congress a written report outlining the Secretary's recommendations for legislative and administrative actions to facilitate the removal or modification of excessive, duplicative, or unnecessary regulations or other requirements of Federal, State, or local governments that (1) inflate the costs of or otherwise inhibit the construction, rehabilitation, or management of housing, particularly housing that otherwise could be affordable to low-income and moderate-income families, or (2) contribute to economic or racial discrimination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Treatment of troubled public housing agencies</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Effect of troubled status on CHAS</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The comprehensive housing affordability strategy (or any consolidated plan incorporating such strategy) for the State or unit of general local government in which any troubled public housing agency is located shall not be considered to comply with the requirements under this section unless such plan includes a description of the manner in which the State or unit will provide financial or other assistance to such troubled agency in improving its operations to remove such designation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;troubled public housing agency&rdquo; means a public housing agency that, upon the effective date of the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998, is designated under section 6(j)(2) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 [42 U.S.C. 1437d(j)(2)] as a troubled public housing agency.</p>
