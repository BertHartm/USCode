<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of States whose laws or regulations are in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary, subject to subsection (c)(2) of this section, may make grants to the States for carrying out programs to provide partner counseling and referral services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Description of compliant State programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the laws or regulations of a State are in accordance with this subsection if under such laws or regulations (including programs carried out pursuant to the discretion of State officials) the following policies are in effect:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The State requires that the public health officer of the State carry out a program of partner notification to inform partners of individuals with HIV disease that the partners may have been exposed to the disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) In the case of a health entity that provides for the performance on an individual of a test for HIV disease, or that treats the individual for the disease, the State requires, subject to subparagraph (B), that the entity confidentially report the positive test results to the State public health officer in a manner recommended and approved by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, together with such additional information as may be necessary for carrying out such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The State may provide that the requirement of subparagraph (A) does not apply to the testing of an individual for HIV disease if the individual underwent the testing through a program designed to perform the test and provide the results to the individual without the individual disclosing his or her identity to the program. This subparagraph may not be construed as affecting the requirement of subparagraph (A) with respect to a health entity that treats an individual for HIV disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The program under paragraph (1) is carried out in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Partners are provided with an appropriate opportunity to learn that the partners have been exposed to HIV disease, subject to subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The State does not inform partners of the identity of the infected individuals involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Counseling and testing for HIV disease are made available to the partners and to infected individuals, and such counseling includes information on modes of transmission for the disease, including information on prenatal and perinatal transmission and preventing transmission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Counseling of infected individuals and their partners includes the provision of information regarding therapeutic measures for preventing and treating the deterioration of the immune system and conditions arising from the disease, and the provision of other prevention-related information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Referrals for appropriate services are provided to partners and infected individuals, including referrals for support services and legal aid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Notifications under subparagraph (A) are provided in person, unless doing so is an unreasonable burden on the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) There is no criminal or civil penalty on, or civil liability for, an infected individual if the individual chooses not to identify the partners of the individual, or the individual does not otherwise cooperate with such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) The failure of the State to notify partners is not a basis for the civil liability of any health entity who under the program reported to the State the identity of the infected individual involved.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1098 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) The State provides that the provisions of the program may not be construed as prohibiting the State from providing a notification under subparagraph (A) without the consent of the infected individual involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The State annually reports to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the number of individuals from whom the names of partners have been sought under the program under paragraph (1), the number of such individuals who provided the names of partners, and the number of partners so named who were notified under the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The State cooperates with such Director in carrying out a national program of partner notification, including the sharing of information between the public health officers of the States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reporting system for cases of HIV disease; preference in making grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making grants under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall give preference to States whose reporting systems for cases of HIV disease produce data on such cases that is sufficiently accurate and reliable for use for purposes of section 300ff&ndash;28(a)(2)(D)(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of carrying out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2005.</p>
