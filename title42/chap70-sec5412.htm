<p class="statutory-body">(a) If the Secretary or a court of appropriate jurisdiction determines that any manufactured <!-- PDFPage:4039 -->home does not conform to applicable Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards, or that it contains a defect which constitutes an imminent safety hazard, after the sale of such manufactured home by a manufacturer to a distributor or a dealer and prior to the sale of such manufactured home by such distributor or dealer to a purchaser&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the manufacturer shall immediately repurchase such manufactured home from such distributor or dealer at the price paid by such distributor or dealer, plus all transportation charges involved and a reasonable reimbursement of not less than 1 per centum per month of such price paid prorated from the date of receipt by certified mail of notice of such nonconformance to the date of repurchase by the manufacturer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the manufacturer, at his own expense, shall immediately furnish the purchasing distributor or dealer the required conforming part or parts or equipment for installation by the distributor or dealer on or in such manufactured home, and for the installation involved the manufacturer shall reimburse such distributor or dealer for the reasonable value of such installation plus a reasonable reimbursement of not less than 1 per centum per month of the manufacturer's or distributor's selling price prorated from the date of receipt by certified mail of notice of such nonconformance to the date such vehicle is brought into conformance with applicable Federal standards, so long as the distributor or dealer proceeds with reasonable diligence with the installation after the required part or equipment is received.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The value of such reasonable reimbursements as specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection shall be fixed by mutual agreement of the parties, or, failing such agreement, by the court pursuant to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section.</p>

Such action may be brought in any district court in the United States in the district in which such manufacturer resides, or is found, or has an agent, without regard to the amount in controversy, and the person bringing the action shall also be entitled to recover any damage sustained by him, as well as all court costs plus reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees. Any action brought pursuant to this section shall be forever barred unless commenced within three years after the cause of action shall have accrued.</p>
