<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to enter into and perform such contracts, leases, cooperative agreements, or other similar transactions with public agencies and private organizations and persons, and to make such payments (in lump sum or installments, and by way of advance or reimbursement) as he may deem to be necessary or appropriate to carry out functions now or hereafter vested in the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on authority; appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no authority to enter into contracts or to make payments under this subchapter shall be effective except to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Leasing of excess Department of Energy property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may lease, upon terms and conditions the Secretary considers appropriate to promote national security or the public interest, acquired real property and related personal property that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is located at a facility of the Department of Energy to be closed or reconfigured;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at the time the lease is entered into, is not needed by the Department of Energy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is under the control of the Department of Energy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms of lease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section may not be for a term of more than 10 years, except that the Secretary may enter into a lease that includes an option to renew for a term of more than 10 years if the Secretary determines that entering into such a lease will promote the national security or be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section may provide for the payment (in cash or in kind) by the lessee of consideration in an amount that is less than the fair market rental value of the leasehold interest. Services relating to the protection and maintenance of the leased property may constitute all or part of such consideration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Environmental concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before entering into a lease under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (with respect to property located on a site on the National Priorities List) or the appropriate State official (with respect to property located on a site that is not listed on the National Priorities List) to determine whether the environmental conditions of the property are such that leasing the property, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, are consistent with safety and the protection of public health and the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before entering into a lease under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall obtain the concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the appropriate State official, as the case may be, in the determination required under paragraph (1). The Secretary may enter into a lease under subsection (c) of this section without obtaining such concurrence if, within 60 days after the Secretary requests the concurrence, the Admin<!-- PDFPage:4378 -->istrator or appropriate State official, as the case may be, fails to submit to the Secretary a notice of such individual's concurrence with, or rejection of, the determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Retention and use of rentals; report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent provided in advance in appropriations Acts, the Secretary may retain and use money rentals received by the Secretary directly from a lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section in any amount the Secretary considers necessary to cover the administrative expenses of the lease, the maintenance and repair of the leased property, or environmental restoration activities at the facility where the leased property is located. Amounts retained under this subsection shall be retained in a separate fund established in the Treasury for such purpose. The Secretary shall annually submit to the Congress a report on amounts retained and amounts used under this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Property rights in inventions and discoveries; timely determination; reports to Congressional committees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever any contractor makes an invention or discovery to which the title vests in the Department of Energy pursuant to exercise of section 202(a)(ii) or (iv) of title 35, or pursuant to section 2182 of this title or section 5908 of this title in the course of or under any Government contract or subcontract of the Naval Nuclear Propulsion Program or the nuclear weapons programs or other atomic energy defense activities of the Department of Energy and the contractor requests waiver of any or all of the Government's property rights, the Secretary of Energy may decide to waive the Government's rights and assign the rights in such invention or discovery.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such decision shall be made within 150 days after the date on which a complete request for waiver of such rights has been submitted to the Secretary by the contractor. For purposes of this paragraph, a complete request includes such information, in such detail and form, as the Secretary by regulation prescribes as necessary to allow the Secretary to take into consideration the matters described in subsection (b) of this section in making the decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Included load forecasting.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Provided methods of validating predicted performance in order to determine whether objectives in the plan are being met.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Met such other criteria as the Administrator shall require.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of other integrated resource plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a customer or group of customers are implementing integrated resource planning under a program responding to Federal, State, or other initiatives, including integrated resource planning considered and implemented pursuant to section 2621(d) of title 16, in evaluating that customer's integrated resource plan under sections 7275 to 7276c of this title, the Administrator shall accept such plan as fulfillment of the requirements of sections 7275 to 7276c of this title to the extent such plan substantially complies with the requirements of sections 7275 to 7276c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Compliance with integrated resource plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Administrator shall, by regulation, revise the Final Amended Guidelines and Acceptance Criteria for Customer Conservation and Renewable Energy Programs published in the Federal Register on August 21, 1985 (50 F.R. 33892), or any subsequent amendments thereto, to require each customer to fully comply with the applicable integrated resource plan and submit an annual report to the Administrator (in such form and containing such information as the Administrator may require) describing the customer's progress to the goals established in such plan. After the initial review under subsection (a) of this section the Administrator shall periodically conduct reviews of a representative sample of applicable integrated resource plans and the customer's implementation of the applicable integrated resource plan to determine if the customers are in compliance with their plans. If the Administrator finds a customer out-of-compliance, the Administrator shall impose a surcharge under this section on all electric energy purchased by the customer from the Western Area Power Administration or reduce such customer's power allocation by 10 percent, unless the Administrator finds that a good faith effort has been made to comply with the approved plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No approved plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an integrated resource plan for any customer is not submitted before the date 12 months after the guidelines are amended as required under this section or if the plan is disapproved by the Administrator and a revised plan is not resubmitted by the date 9 months after the date of such disapproval, the Administrator shall impose a surcharge of 10 percent of the purchase price on all power obtained by that customer from the Western Area Power Administration after such date. The surcharge shall remain in effect until an integrated resource plan is approved for that customer. If the plan is not submitted for more than one year after the required date, the surcharge shall increase to 20 percent for the second year (or any portion thereof prior to approval of the plan) and to 30 percent thereafter until the plan is submitted or the contract for the purchase of power by such customer from the Western Area Power Administration terminates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Failure to comply with approved plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After approval by the Administrator of an applicable integrated resource plan for any customer, the Administrator shall impose a 10 percent surcharge on all power purchased by such customer from the Western Area Power Administration whenever the Administrator determines that such customer's activities are not consistent with the applicable integrated resource plan. The surcharge shall remain in effect until the Administrator determines that the customer's activities are consistent with the applicable integrated resource plan. The surcharge shall be increased to 20 percent if the customer's activities are out of compliance for more than one year and to 30 percent after more than 2 years, except that no surcharge shall be imposed if the customer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that a good faith effort has been made to comply with the approved plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduction in power allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any customer subject to a surcharge under paragraph (1) or (2), in lieu of imposing such surcharge the Administrator may reduce such customer's power allocation from the Western Area Power Administration by 10 percent. The Administrator shall provide by regulation the terms and conditions under which a power allocation terminated under this subsection may be reinstated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Integrated resource planning cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With the approval of the Administrator, customers within any State or region may form integrated resource planning cooperatives for the purposes of complying with sections 7275 to 7276c of this title, and such customers shall be allowed an additional 6 months to submit an initial integrated resource plan to the Administrator.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4405 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Customers with more than 1 contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If more than one long-term firm power service contract exists between the Administrator and a customer, only one integrated resource plan shall be required for that customer under sections 7275 to 7276c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Program review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after January 1, 1999, and at appropriate intervals thereafter, the Administrator shall initiate a public process to review the program established by this section. The Administrator is authorized at that time to revise the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this section to reflect changes, if any, in technology, needs, or other developments.</p>
