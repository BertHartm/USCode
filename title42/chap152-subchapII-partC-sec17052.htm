<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a program for making grants for providing assistance to retail and wholesale motor fuel dealers or other entities for the installation, replacement, or conversion of motor fuel storage and dispensing infrastructure to be used exclusively to store and dispense renewable fuel blends.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Selection criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 12 months after December 19, 2007, the Secretary shall establish criteria for evaluating applications for grants under this <!-- PDFPage:7646 -->subsection that will maximize the availability and use of renewable fuel blends, and that will ensure that renewable fuel blends are available across the country. Such criteria shall provide for&mdash;</p>
