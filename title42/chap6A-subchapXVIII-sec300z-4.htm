<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) show evidence&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of an applicant who will provide care services, of having the ability to bring together a wide range of needed core services and, as appropriate, supplemental services in comprehensive single-site projects, or to establish a well-integrated network of such services (appropriate for the target population and geographic area to be served including the special needs of rural areas) for pregnant adolescents or adolescent parents; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in the case of an applicant who will provide prevention services, of having the ability to provide prevention services for adolescents and their families which are appropriate for the target population and the geographic area to be served, including the special needs of rural areas;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) will utilize to the maximum extent feasible existing available programs and facilities such as neighborhood and primary health care centers, maternity homes which provide or can be equipped to provide services to pregnant adolescents, agencies serving families, youth, and children with established programs of service to pregnant adolescents and vulnerable families, licensed adoption agencies, children and youth centers, maternal and infant health centers, regional rural health facilities, school and other educational programs, mental health programs, nutrition programs, recreation programs, and other ongoing pregnancy prevention services and programs of care for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) make use, to the maximum extent feasible, of other Federal, State, and local funds, programs, contributions, and other third-party reimbursements;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of a grant for a demonstration project for services under this subchapter shall be determined by the Secretary, based on factors such as the incidence of adolescent pregnancy in the geographic area to be served, and the adequacy of pregnancy prevention services and programs of care for pregnant adolescents and adolescent parents in such area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In making grants for demonstration projects for services under this subchapter, the <!-- PDFPage:882 -->Secretary shall consider the special needs of rural areas and, to the maximum extent practicable, shall distribute funds taking into consideration the relative number of adolescents in such areas in need of such services.</p>
