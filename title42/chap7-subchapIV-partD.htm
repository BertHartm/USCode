<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Linking of local disbursement units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State disbursement unit may be established by linking local disbursement units through an automated information network, subject to this section, if the Secretary agrees that the system will not cost more nor take more time to establish or operate than a centralized system. In addition, employers shall be given 1 location to which income withholding is sent.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1346 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State disbursement unit shall use automated procedures, electronic processes, and computer-driven technology to the maximum extent feasible, efficient, and economical, for the collection and disbursement of support payments, including procedures&mdash;</p>

The date of collection for amounts collected and distributed under this part is the date of receipt by the State disbursement unit, except that if current support is withheld by an employer in the month when due and is received by the State disbursement unit in a month other than the month when due, the date of withholding may be deemed to be the date of collection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Permissive retention of arrearages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State disbursement unit may delay the distribution of collections toward arrearages until the resolution of any timely appeal with respect to such arrearages.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A grant under this subsection shall be made only upon a finding by the Secretary that the project involved is likely to be of significant assistance in carrying out the purpose of this subsection; and with respect to such project the Secretary may waive any of the requirements of this part which would otherwise be applicable, to such extent and for such period as the Secretary determines is necessary or desirable in order to enable the State to carry out the project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall be retained by the State, if any portion of the amounts collected remains after making the payments required under paragraphs (1) and (2), to the extent that such portion is necessary to reimburse the State (with appropriate reimbursement to the Federal Government to the extent of its participation in the financing) for any past foster care maintenance payments (or payments of assistance under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter) which were made with respect to the child (and with respect to which past collections have not previously been retained);</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; requirement; quarterly payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage and reward State child support enforcement programs which perform in a cost-effective and efficient manner to secure support for all children who have sought assistance in securing support, whether such children reside within the State or elsewhere and whether or not they are eligible for aid to families with dependent children under a State plan approved under part A of this subchapter, and regardless of the economic circumstances of their parents, the Secretary shall, from support collected which would otherwise represent the Federal share of assistance to families of noncustodial parents, pay to each State for each fiscal year, on a quarterly basis (as described in subsection (e) of this section) beginning with the quarter commencing October 1, 1985, an incentive payment in an amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incentive formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the incentive payment shall be equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 6 percent of the total amount of support collected under the plan during the fiscal year in cases in which the support obligation involved is assigned to the State pursuant to section 602(a)(26)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#658_1_target" name="658_1">1</a></sup> or section 671(a)(17) of this title (with such total amount for any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;AFDC collections&rdquo; for that year), plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 6 percent of the total amount of support collected during the fiscal year in all other cases under this part (with such total amount for any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;non-AFDC collections&rdquo; for that year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If subsection (c) of this section applies with respect to a State's AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections for any fiscal year, the percent specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (B) (with respect to such collections) shall be increased to the higher percent determined under such subsection (with respect to such collections) in determining the State's incentive payment under this subsection for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The dollar amount of the portion of the State's incentive payment for any fiscal year which is determined on the basis of its non-AFDC collections under paragraph (1)(B) (after adjustment under subsection (c) of this section if applicable) shall in no case exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the dollar amount of the portion of such payment which is determined on the basis of its AFDC collections under paragraph (1)(A) (after adjustment under subsection (c) of this section if applicable) in the case of fiscal year 1986 or 1987;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 105 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1988;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 110 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1989; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 115 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1990 or any fiscal year thereafter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall make such additional payments to the State under this part, for fiscal year 1986 or 1987, as may be necessary to assure that the total amount of payments under this section and section 655(a)(1)(A) of this title for such fiscal year is no less than 80 percent of the amount that would have been payable to that State and its political subdivisions for such fiscal year under this section and section 655(a)(1)(A) of this title if those sections (including the amendment made by section 5(c)(2)(A) of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984) had remained in effect as they were in effect for fiscal year 1985.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increase in percentage; laboratory costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the total amount of a State's AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections for any fiscal <!-- PDFPage:1356 -->year bears a ratio to the total amount expended by the State in that year for the operation of its plan approved under section 654 of this title for which payment may be made under section 655 of this title (with the total amount so expended in any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;combined AFDC/non-AFDC administrative costs&rdquo; for that year) which is equal to or greater than 1.4, the relevant percent specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section (with respect to such collections) shall be increased to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 6.5 percent, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) one-half of 1 percent for each full two-tenths by which such ratio exceeds 1.4;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the percent so specified shall in no event be increased (for either AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections) to more than 10 percent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity in any fiscal year may at the option of the State be excluded from the State's combined AFDC/non-AFDC administrative costs for that year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Support collected on behalf of individuals residing in another State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing incentive payments under this section, support which is collected by one State at the request of another State, including amounts collected under section 666(a)(14) of this title, shall be treated as having been collected in full by each such State, and any amounts expended by the State in carrying out a special project assisted under section 655(e) of this title shall be excluded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Estimates by Secretary; quarterly payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amounts of the incentive payments to be made to the various States under this section for any fiscal year shall be estimated by the Secretary at or before the beginning of such year on the basis of the best information available. The Secretary shall make such payments for such year, on a quarterly basis (with each quarterly payment being made no later than the beginning of the quarter involved), in the amounts so estimated, reduced or increased to the extent of any overpayments or underpayments which the Secretary determines were made under this section to the States involved for prior periods and with respect to which adjustment has not already been made under this subsection. Upon the making of any estimate by the Secretary under the preceding sentence, any appropriations available for payments under this section shall be deemed obligated.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;664. Collection of past-due support from Federal tax refunds</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procedures applicable; distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support which has been assigned to such State pursuant to section 608(a)(3) or section 671(a)(17) of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual). If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall withhold from such refunds an amount equal to the past-due support, shall concurrently send notice to such individual that the withholding has been made (including in or with such notice a notification to any other person who may have filed a joint <!-- PDFPage:1365 -->return with such individual of the steps which such other person may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the refund), and shall pay such amount to the State agency (together with notice of the individual's home address) for distribution in accordance with section 657 of this title. This subsection may be executed by the disbursing official of the Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support (as that term is defined for purposes of this paragraph under subsection (c) of this section) which such State has agreed to collect under section 654(4)(A)(ii) of this title, and that the State agency has sent notice to such individual in accordance with paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual). If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall withhold from such refunds an amount equal to such past-due support, and shall concurrently send notice to such individual that the withholding has been made, including in or with such notice a notification to any other person who may have filed a joint return with such individual of the steps which such other person may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the refund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay the amount withheld to the State agency, and the State shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury any fee imposed by the Secretary of the Treasury to cover the costs of the withholding and any required notification. The State agency shall, subject to paragraph (3)(B), distribute such amount to or on behalf of the child to whom the support was owed in accordance with section 657 of this title. This subsection may be executed by the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury or his designee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply only with respect to refunds payable under section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 after December 31, 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Prior to notifying the Secretary of the Treasury under paragraph (1) or (2) that an individual owes past-due support, the State shall send notice to such individual that a withholding will be made from any refund otherwise payable to such individual. The notice shall also (i) instruct the individual owing the past-due support of the steps which may be taken to contest the State's determination that past-due support is owed or the amount of the past-due support, and (ii) provide information, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by regulation in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, with respect to procedures to be followed, in the case of a joint return, to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to another person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that an amount should be withheld under paragraph (1) or (2), and that the refund from which it should be withheld is based upon a joint return, the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the State that the withholding is being made from a refund based upon a joint return, and shall furnish to the State the names and addresses of each taxpayer filing such joint return. In the case of a withholding under paragraph (2), the State may delay distribution of the amount withheld until the State has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that the other person filing the joint return has received his or her proper share of the refund, but such delay may not exceed six months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the other person filing the joint return with the named individual owing the past-due support takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of a refund from which a withholding was made under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay such share to such other person. The Secretary of the Treasury shall deduct the amount of such payment from amounts subsequently payable to the State agency to which the amount originally withheld from such refund was paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any case in which an amount was withheld under paragraph (1) or (2) and paid to a State, and the State subsequently determines that the amount certified as past-due support was in excess of the amount actually owed at the time the amount withheld is to be distributed to or on behalf of the child, the State shall pay the excess amount withheld to the named individual thought to have owed the past-due support (or, in the case of amounts withheld on the basis of a joint return, jointly to the parties filing such return).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations; contents, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations, approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, prescribing the time or times at which States must submit notices of past-due support, the manner in which such notices must be submitted, and the necessary information that must be contained in or accompany the notices. The regulations shall be consistent with the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section, shall specify the minimum amount of past-due support to which the offset procedure established by subsection (a) of this section may be applied, and the fee that a State must pay to reimburse the Secretary of the Treasury for the full cost of applying the offset procedure, and shall provide that the Secretary of the Treasury will advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services, not less frequently than annually, of the States which have furnished notices of past-due support under subsection (a) of this section, the number of cases in each State with respect to which such notices have been furnished, the amount of support sought to be collected under this subsection by each State, and the amount of such collections actually made in the case of each State. Any fee paid to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection may be used to reimburse appropriations which bore all or part of the cost of applying such procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of withholdings made under subsection (a)(2) of this section, the regulations promulgated pursuant to this subsection shall include the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The withholding shall apply only in the case where the State determines that the <!-- PDFPage:1366 -->amount of the past-due support which will be owed at the time the withholding is to be made, based upon the pattern of payment of support and other enforcement actions being pursued to collect the past-due support, is equal to or greater than $500. The State may limit the $500 threshold amount to amounts of past-due support accrued since the time that the State first began to enforce the child support order involved under the State plan, and may limit the application of the withholding to past-due support accrued since such time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The fee which the Secretary of the Treasury may impose to cover the costs of the withholding and notification may not exceed $25 per case submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Past-due support&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), as used in this part the term &ldquo;past-due support&rdquo; means the amount of a delinquency, determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative process established under State law, for support and maintenance of a child, or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, the term &ldquo;past-due support&rdquo; means only past-due support owed to or on behalf of a qualified child (or a qualified child and the parent with whom the child is living if the same support order includes support for the child and the parent).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;qualified child&rdquo; means a child&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) who is a minor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) who, while a minor, was determined to be disabled under subchapter II or XVI of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for whom an order of support is in force.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Mandatory allotment; notice upon failure to make; amount of allotment; adjustment or discontinuance; consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which child support payments or child and spousal support payments are owed by a member of one of the uniformed services (as defined in section 101(3) of title 37) on active duty, such member shall be required to make allotments from his pay and allowances (under chapter 13 of title 37) as payment of such support, when he has failed to make periodic payments under a support order that meets the criteria specified in section 1673(b)(1)(A) of title 15 and the resulting delinquency in such payments is in a total amount equal to the support payable for two months or longer. Failure to make such payments shall be established by notice from an authorized person (as defined in subsection (b) of this section) to the designated official in the appropriate uniformed service. Such notice (which shall in turn be given to the affected member) shall also specify the person to whom the allotment is to be payable. The amount of the allotment shall be the amount necessary to comply with the order (which, if the order so provides, may include arrearages as well as amounts for current support), except that the amount of the allotment, together with any other amounts withheld for support from the wages of the member, as a percentage of his pay from the uniformed service, shall not exceed the limits prescribed in sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#665_1_target" name="665_1">1</a></sup> 1673(b) and (c) of title 15. An allotment under this subsection shall be adjusted or discontinued upon notice from the authorized person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, no action shall be taken to require an allotment from the pay and allowances of any member of one of the uniformed services under such provisions (A) until such member has had a consultation with a judge advocate of the service involved (as defined in section 801(13) of title 10), or with a law specialist (as defined in section 801(11) of such title) in the case of the Coast Guard, or with a legal officer designated by the Secretary concerned (as defined in section 101(5) of title 37) in any other case, in person, to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect to the member's support obligation and his failure to make payments thereon, or (B) until 30 days have elapsed after the notice described in the second sentence of paragraph (1) is given to the affected member in any case where it has not been possible, despite continuing good faith efforts, to arrange such a consultation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Authorized person&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section the term &ldquo;authorized person&rdquo; with respect to any member of the uniformed services means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any agent or attorney of a State having in effect a plan approved under this part who has the duty or authority under such plan to seek to recover any amounts owed by such member as child or child and spousal support (including, when authorized under the State plan, any official of a political subdivision); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the court which has authority to issue an order against such member for the support and maintenance of a child, or any agent of such court.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount by which such refund is reduced shall be distributed in accordance with section 657 of this title in the case of overdue support assigned to a State pursuant to section 608(a)(3) or 671(a)(17) of this title, or, in any other case, shall be distributed, after deduction of any fees imposed by the State to cover the costs of collection, to the child or parent to whom such support is owed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notice of the noncustodial parent's social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) and home address shall be furnished to the State agency requesting the refund offset, and to the State agency enforcing the order.</p>

If there are arrearages to be collected, amounts withheld to satisfy such arrearages, when added to the amounts withheld to pay current support and provide for the fee, may not exceed the limit permitted under such section 1673(b), but the State need not withhold up to the maximum amount permitted under such section in order to satisfy arrearages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such withholding must be provided without the necessity of any application therefor in the case of a child (whether or not eligible for assistance under a State program funded under part A of this subchapter) with respect to whom services are already being provided under the State plan under this part, and must be provided in accordance with this subsection <!-- PDFPage:1373 -->on the basis of an application for services under the State plan in the case of any other child in whose behalf a support order has been issued or modified in the State. In either case such withholding must occur without the need for any amendment to the support order involved or for any further action (other than those actions required under this part) by the court or other entity which issued such order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The income of a noncustodial parent shall be subject to such withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, in the case of a support order being enforced under this part that is issued or modified on or after the first day of the 25th month beginning after October 13, 1988, on the effective date of the order; except that such income shall not be subject to such withholding under this subparagraph in any case where (i) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court (or administrative process) finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or (ii) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The income of a noncustodial parent shall become subject to such withholding, in the case of income not subject to withholding under subparagraph (A), on the date on which the payments which the noncustodial parent has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the date as of which the noncustodial parent requests that such withholding begin,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A)(i) The employer of any noncustodial parent to whom paragraph (1) applies, upon being given notice as described in clause (ii), must be required to withhold from such noncustodial parent's income the amount specified by such notice (which may include a fee, established by the State, to be paid to the employer unless waived by such employer) and pay such amount (after deducting and retaining any portion thereof which represents the fee so established) to the State disbursement unit within 7 business days after the date the amount would (but for this subsection) have been paid or credited to the employee, for distribution in accordance with this part. The employer shall withhold funds as directed in the notice, except that when an employer receives an income withholding order issued by another State, the employer shall apply the income withholding law of the state&nbsp;<sup><a href="#666_2_target" name="666_2">2</a></sup> of the obligor's principal place of employment in determining&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The employer must be held liable to the State for any amount which such employer fails to withhold from income due an employee following receipt by such employer of proper notice under subparagraph (A), but such employer shall not be required to vary the normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Provision must be made for the imposition of a fine against any employer who&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The State must extend its withholding system under this subsection so that such system will include withholding from income derived within such State in cases where the applicable support orders were issued in other States, in order to assure that child support owed by noncustodial parents in such State or any other State will be collected without regard to the residence of the child for whom the support is payable or of such child's custodial parent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Provision must be made for terminating withholding.</p>
