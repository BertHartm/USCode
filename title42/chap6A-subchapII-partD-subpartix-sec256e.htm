<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make two payments under this section to each children's hospital for each of fiscal years 2000 through 2005, one for the direct expenses and the other for indirect expenses associated with operating approved graduate medical residency training programs. The Secretary shall promulgate regulations pursuant to the rulemaking requirements of title 5 which shall govern payments made under this subpart.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amount of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the amounts payable under this section to a children's hospital for an approved graduate medical residency training program for a fiscal year are each of the following amounts:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Direct expense amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount determined under subsection (c) of this section for direct expenses associated with operating approved graduate medical residency training programs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Indirect expense amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount determined under subsection (d) of this section for indirect expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill patients and the additional costs relating to teaching residents in such programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Capped amount</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The total of the payments made to children's hospitals under paragraph (1)(A) or paragraph (1)(B) in a fiscal year shall not exceed the funds appropriated under paragraph (1) or (2), respectively, of subsection (f) of this section for such payments for that fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Pro rata reductions of payments for direct expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary determines that the amount of funds appropriated under subsection (f)(1) of this section for a fiscal year is insufficient to provide the total amount of payments otherwise due for such periods <!-- PDFPage:281 -->under paragraph (1)(A), the Secretary shall reduce the amounts so payable on a pro rata basis to reflect such shortfall.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Amount of payment for direct graduate medical education</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount determined under this subsection for payments to a children's hospital for direct graduate expenses relating to approved graduate medical residency training programs for a fiscal year is equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education, as determined under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the average number of full-time equivalent residents in the hospital's graduate approved medical residency training programs (as determined under section 1395ww(h)(4) of this title during the fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The updated per resident amount for direct graduate medical education for a hospital for a fiscal year is an amount determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Determination of hospital single per resident amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute for each hospital operating an approved graduate medical education program (regardless of whether or not it is a children's hospital) a single per resident amount equal to the average (weighted by number of full-time equivalent residents) of the primary care per resident amount and the non-primary care per resident amount computed under section 1395ww(h)(2) of this title for cost reporting periods ending during fiscal year 1997.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Determination of wage and non-wage-related proportion of the single per resident amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall estimate the average proportion of the single per resident amounts computed under subparagraph (A) that is attributable to wages and wage-related costs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Standardizing per resident amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish a standardized per resident amount for each such hospital&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by dividing the single per resident amount computed under subparagraph (A) into a wage-related portion and a non-wage-related portion by applying the proportion determined under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by dividing the wage-related portion by the factor applied under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title for discharges occurring during fiscal year 1999 for the hospital's area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Determination of national average</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute a national average per resident amount equal to the average of the standardized per resident amounts computed under subparagraph (C) for such hospitals, with the amount for each hospital weighted by the average number of full-time equivalent residents at such hospital.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Application to individual hospitals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute for each such hospital that is a children's hospital a per resident amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) by dividing the national average per resident amount computed under subparagraph (D) into a wage-related portion and a non-wage-related portion by applying the proportion determined under subparagraph (B);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by multiplying the wage-related portion by the factor described in subparagraph (C)(ii) for the hospital's area; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) by adding the non-wage-related portion to the amount computed under clause (ii).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Updating rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall update such per resident amount for each such children's hospital by the estimated percentage increase in the consumer price index for all urban consumers during the period beginning October 1997 and ending with the midpoint of the Federal fiscal year for which payments are made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Amount of payment for indirect medical education</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount determined under this subsection for payments to a children's hospital for indirect expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill patients and the additional costs related to the teaching of residents for a fiscal year is equal to an amount determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) take into account variations in case mix among children's hospitals and the number of full-time equivalent residents in the hospitals&rsquo; approved graduate medical residency training programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) assure that the aggregate of the payments for indirect expenses associated with the treatment of more severely ill patients and the additional costs related to the teaching of residents under this section in a fiscal year are equal to the amount appropriated for such expenses for the fiscal year involved under subsection (f)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Making of payments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Interim payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall determine, before the beginning of each fiscal year involved for which payments may be made for a hospital under this section, the amounts of the payments for direct graduate medical education and indirect medical education for such fiscal <!-- PDFPage:282 -->year and shall (subject to paragraph (2)) make the payments of such amounts in 26 equal interim installments during such period. Such interim payments to each individual hospital shall be based on the number of residents reported in the hospital's most recently filed Medicare cost report prior to the application date for the Federal fiscal year for which the interim payment amounts are established. In the case of a hospital that does not report residents on a Medicare cost report, such interim payments shall be based on the number of residents trained during the hospital's most recently completed Medicare cost report filing period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Withholding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall withhold up to 25 percent from each interim installment for direct and indirect graduate medical education paid under paragraph (1). The Secretary shall withhold up to 25 percent from each interim installment for direct and indirect graduate medical education paid under paragraph (1) as necessary to ensure a hospital will not be overpaid on an interim basis.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reconciliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Prior to the end of each fiscal year, the Secretary shall determine any changes to the number of residents reported by a hospital in the application of the hospital for the current fiscal year to determine the final amount payable to the hospital for the current fiscal year for both direct expense and indirect expense amounts. Based on such determination, the Secretary shall recoup any overpayments made to pay any balance due to the extent possible. The final amount so determined shall be considered a final intermediary determination for the purposes of section 1395<em>oo</em> of this title and shall be subject to administrative and judicial review under that section in the same manner as the amount of payment under section 1395ww(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#256e_1_target" name="256e_1">1</a></sup> of this title is subject to review under such section.</p>
