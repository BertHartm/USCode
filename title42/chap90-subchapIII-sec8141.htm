<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that artistic, cultural, and historic resources, including urban design, constitute an integral part of a suitable living environment for the residents of the Nation's urban areas, and should be available to all residents of such areas, regardless of income;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the development or preservation of such resources is a significant and necessary factor in restoring and maintaining the vitality of the urban environment, and can serve as a catalyst for improving decaying or deteriorated urban communities and expanding economic opportunities, and for creating a sense of community identity, spirit, and pride; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that the encouragement and support of local initiatives to develop or preserve such resources, particularly in connection with federally assisted housing or community development activities or in communities with a high proportion of low-income residents, is an appropriate function of the Federal Government.</p>
