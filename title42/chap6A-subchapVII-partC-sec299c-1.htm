<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator shall establish such technical and scientific peer review groups as may be necessary to carry out this section. Such groups shall be established without regard to the provisions of title 5 that govern appointments in the competitive service, and without regard to the provisions of chapter 51, and subchapter III of chapter 53, of such title that relate to classification and pay rates under the General Schedule.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Membership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The members of any peer review group established under this section shall be appointed from among individuals who by virtue of their training or experience are eminently qualified to carry out the duties of such peer review group.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of applications described in subsection (a)(1) of this section for financial assistance whose direct costs will not exceed $50,000, the Administrator may make appropriate adjustments in the procedures otherwise established by the Administrator for the conduct of peer review under this section. Such adjustments may be made for the purpose of encouraging the entry of individuals into the field of research, for the purpose of encouraging clinical practice-oriented research, and for such other purposes as the Administrator may determine to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Regulations</h4>
