<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall periodically determine the amount which should be paid under this part to each provider of services with respect to the services furnished by it, and the provider of services shall be paid, at such time or times as the Secretary believes appropriate (but not less often than monthly) and prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office, from the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, the amounts so determined, with necessary adjustments on account of previously made overpayments or underpayments; except that no such payments shall be made to any provider unless it has furnished such information as the Secretary may request in order to determine the amounts due such provider under this part for the period with respect to which the amounts are being paid or any prior period.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment shall be made to a provider of services which is a hospital for or with respect to services furnished by it for any period with respect to which it is deemed, under section 1395x(w)(2) of this title, to have in effect an arrangement with a quality control and peer review organization for the conduct of utilization review activities by such organization unless such hospital has paid to such organization the amount due (as determined pursuant to such section) to such organization for the review activities conducted by it pursuant to such arrangements or such hospital has provided assurances satisfactory to the Secretary that such organization will promptly be paid the amount so due to it from the proceeds of the payment claimed by the hospital. Payment under this subchapter for utilization review activities provided by a quality control and peer review organization pursuant to an arrangement or deemed arrangement with a hospital under section 1395x(w)(2) of this title shall be calculated without any requirement that the reasonable cost of such activities be apportioned among the patients of such hospital, if any, to whom such activities were not applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Payments under assignment or power of attorney</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment which may be made to a provider of services under this subchapter for any service furnished to an individual shall be made to any other person under an assignment or power of attorney; but nothing in this subsection shall be construed (1) to prevent the making of such a payment in accordance with an assignment from the provider if such assignment is made to a governmental agency or entity or is established by or pursuant to the order of a court of competent jurisdiction, or (2) to preclude an agent of the provider of services from receiving any such payment if (but only if) such agent does so pursuant to an agency agreement under which the compensation to be paid to the agent for his services for or in connection with the billing or collection of payments due such provider under this subchapter is unrelated (directly or indirectly) to the amount of such payments or the billings therefor, and is not dependent upon the actual collection of any such payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Accrual of interest on balance of excess or deficit not paid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a final determination is made that the amount of payment made under this part to a provider of services was in excess of or less than the amount of payment that is due, and payment of such excess or deficit is not made (or effected by offset) within 30 days of the date of the determination, interest shall accrue on the balance of such excess or deficit not paid or offset (to the extent that the balance is owed by or owing to the provider) at a rate determined in accordance with the regulations of the Secretary of the Treasury applicable to charges for late payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Periodic interim payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall provide payment under this part for inpatient hospital services furnished by a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(1)(B) of this title, and including a distinct psychiatric or rehabilitation unit of such a hospital) and a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(9)(A) of this title) on a periodic interim payment basis (rather than on the basis of bills actually submitted) in the following cases:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Upon the request of a hospital which is paid through an agency or organization with an agreement with the Secretary under section 1395h of this title, if the agency or organization, for three consecutive calendar months, fails to meet the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of such section and if the hospital meets the requirements (in effect as of October 1, 1986) applicable to payment on such a basis, until such time as the agency or organization meets such requirements for three consecutive calendar months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In the case of&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395g_1_target" name="1395g_1">1</a></sup> hospital that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) has a disproportionate share adjustment percentage (as established in clause (iv) of such section) of at least 5.1 percent (as computed for purposes of establishing the average standardized amounts for dis<!-- PDFPage:1655 -->charges occurring during fiscal year 1987), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) requests payment on such basis,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but only if the hospital was being paid for inpatient hospital services on such a periodic interim payment basis as of June 30, 1987, and continues to meet the requirements (in effect as of October 1, 1986) applicable to payment on such a basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) In the case of a hospital that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) is located in a rural area,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) has 100 or fewer beds, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) requests payment on such basis,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but only if the hospital was being paid for inpatient hospital services on such a periodic interim payment basis as of June 30, 1987, and continues to meet the requirements (in effect as of October 1, 1986) applicable to payment on such a basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall provide (or continue to provide) for payment on a periodic interim payment basis (under the standards established under section 405.454(j) of title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, as in effect on October 1, 1986) with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) inpatient hospital services of a hospital that is not a subsection (d) hospital (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(1)(B) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a hospital which is receiving payment under a State hospital reimbursement system under section 1395f(b)(3) or 1395ww(c) of this title, if payment on a periodic interim payment basis is an integral part of such reimbursement system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) extended care services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) home health services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) hospice care;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">if the provider of such services elects to receive, and qualifies for, such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of a subsection (d) hospital or a subsection (d) Puerto Rico hospital (as defined for purposes of section 1395ww of this title) which has significant cash flow problems resulting from operations of its intermediary or from unusual circumstances of the hospital's operation, the Secretary may make available appropriate accelerated payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A hospital created by the merger or consolidation of 2 or more hospitals or hospital campuses shall be eligible to receive periodic interim payment on the basis described in paragraph (1)(B) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) at least one of the hospitals or campuses received periodic interim payment on such basis prior to the merger or consolidation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the merging or consolidating hospitals or campuses would each meet the requirement of paragraph (1)(B)(i) if such hospitals or campuses were treated as independent hospitals for purposes of this subchapter.</p>

A person serving on the Board of Trustees shall not be considered to be a fiduciary and shall not be personally liable for actions taken in such capacity with respect to the Trust Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Investment of Trust Fund by Managing Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Managing Trustee to invest such portion of the Trust Fund as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be made only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of public-debt obligations for purchase by the Trust Fund. Such obligations issued for purchase by the Trust Fund shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the Trust Fund and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield (computed by the Managing Trustee on the basis of market quotations as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue) on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of 4 years from the end of such calendar month; except that where such average market yield is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest on such obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such market yield. The Managing Trustee may purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, on original issue or at the market price, only where he determines that the purchase of such other obligations is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authority of Managing Trustee to sell obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any obligations acquired by the Trust Fund (except public-debt obligations issued exclusively to the Trust Fund) may be sold by the Managing Trustee at the market price, and such public-debt obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Interest on and proceeds from sale or redemption of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Trust Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Trust Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Payment of estimated taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Managing Trustee is directed to pay from time to time from the Trust Fund into the Treasury the amount estimated by him as taxes imposed under section 3101(b) which are subject to refund under section 6413(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 with respect to wages paid after December 31, 1965. Such taxes shall be determined on the basis of the records of wages established and maintained by the Commissioner of Social Security in accordance with the wages reported to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate pursuant to subtitle F of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and the Commissioner of Social Security shall furnish the Managing Trustee such information as may be required by the Managing Trustee for such purpose. The payments by the Managing Trustee shall be covered into the Treasury as repayments to the account for refunding internal revenue collections.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Repayments made under paragraph (1) shall not be available for expenditures but shall be carried to the surplus fund of the Treasury.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) &ldquo;Skilled nursing facility&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this subchapter, the term &ldquo;skilled nursing facility&rdquo; means an institution (or a distinct part of an institution) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is primarily engaged in providing to residents&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) skilled nursing care and related services for residents who require medical or nursing care, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) rehabilitation services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons,</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A skilled nursing facility must care for its residents in such a manner and in such an environment as will promote maintenance or enhancement of the quality of life of each resident.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Quality assessment and assurance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A skilled nursing facility must maintain a quality assessment and assurance committee, consisting of the director of nursing services, a physician designated by the facility, and at least 3 other members of the facility's staff, which (i) meets at least quarterly to identify issues with respect to which quality assessment and assurance activities are necessary and (ii) develops and implements appropriate plans of action to correct identified quality deficiencies. A State or the Secretary may not require disclosure of the records of such committee except insofar as such disclosure is related to the compliance of such committee with the requirements of this subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of services and activities under plan of care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A skilled nursing facility must provide services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident, in accordance with a written plan of care which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) describes the medical, nursing, and psychosocial needs of the resident and how such needs will be met;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is initially prepared, with the participation to the extent practicable of the resident or the resident's family or legal representative, by a team which includes the resident's attending physician and a registered professional nurse with responsibility for the resident; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is periodically reviewed and revised by such team after each assessment under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Residents&rsquo; assessment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A skilled nursing facility must conduct a comprehensive, accurate, standardized, reproducible assessment of each resident's functional capacity, which assessment&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is based on a uniform minimum data set specified by the Secretary under subsection (f)(6)(A) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) uses an instrument which is specified by the State under subsection (e)(5) of this section; and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each such assessment must be conducted or coordinated (with the appropriate par<!-- PDFPage:1675 -->ticipation of health professionals) by a registered professional nurse who signs and certifies the completion of the assessment. Each individual who completes a portion of such an assessment shall sign and certify as to the accuracy of that portion of the assessment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Penalty for falsification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) An individual who willfully and knowingly certifies under clause (i) a material and false statement in a resident assessment is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $1,000 with respect to each assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) An individual who willfully and knowingly causes another individual to certify under clause (i) a material and false statement in a resident assessment is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $5,000 with respect to each assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this clause in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Use of independent assessors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a State determines, under a survey under subsection (g) of this section or otherwise, that there has been a knowing and willful certification of false assessments under this paragraph, the State may require (for a period specified by the State) that resident assessments under this paragraph be conducted and certified by individuals who are independent of the facility and who are approved by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Frequency</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Such an assessment must be conducted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) promptly upon (but no later than 14 days after the date of) admission for each individual admitted on or after October 1, 1990, and by not later than January 1, 1991, for each resident of the facility on that date;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) in no case less often than once every 12 months.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Resident review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The skilled nursing facility must examine each resident no less frequently than once every 3 months and, as appropriate, revise the resident's assessment to assure the continuing accuracy of the assessment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The results of such an assessment shall be used in developing, reviewing, and revising the resident's plan of care under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Coordination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such assessments shall be coordinated with any State-required preadmission screening program to the maximum extent practicable in order to avoid duplicative testing and effort.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Provision of services and activities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent needed to fulfill all plans of care described in paragraph (2), a skilled nursing facility must provide, directly or under arrangements (or, with respect to dental services, under agreements) with others for the provision of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) treatment and services required by mentally ill and mentally retarded residents not otherwise provided or arranged for (or required to be provided or arranged for) by the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The services provided or arranged by the facility must meet professional standards of quality. Nothing in clause (vi) shall be construed as requiring a facility to provide or arrange for dental services described in that clause without additional charge.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Qualified persons providing services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Services described in clauses (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (vi) of subparagraph (A) must be provided by qualified persons in accordance with each resident's written plan of care.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">To the extent that clause (i) may be deemed to require that a skilled nursing facility engage the services of a registered <!-- PDFPage:1676 -->professional nurse for more than 40 hours a week, the Secretary is authorized to waive such requirement if the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the facility is located in a rural area and the supply of skilled nursing facility services in such area is not sufficient to meet the needs of individuals residing therein,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the facility has one full-time registered professional nurse who is regularly on duty at such facility 40 hours a week,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the facility either has only patients whose physicians have indicated (through physicians&rsquo; orders or admission notes) that each such patient does not require the services of a registered nurse or a physician for a 48-hour period, or has made arrangements for a registered professional nurse or a physician to spend such time at such facility as may be indicated as necessary by the physician to provide necessary skilled nursing services on days when the regular full-time registered professional nurse is not on duty,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the Secretary provides notice of the waiver to the State long-term care ombudsman (established under section 307(a)(12) of the Older Americans Act of 1965 [42 U.S.C. 3027(a)(12)]) and the protection and advocacy system in the State for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded, and</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each skilled nursing facility shall be subject to a standard survey, to be conducted without any prior notice to the facility. Any individual who notifies (or causes to be notified) a skilled nursing facility of the time or date on which such a survey is scheduled to be conducted is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $2,000. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title. The Secretary shall review each State's procedures for the scheduling and conduct of standard surveys to assure that the State has taken all reasonable steps to avoid giving notice of such a survey through the scheduling procedures and the conduct of the surveys themselves.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each standard survey shall include, for a case-mix stratified sample of residents&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) a survey of the quality of care furnished, as measured by indicators of medical, nursing, and rehabilitative care, dietary and nutrition services, activities and social participation, and sanitation, infection control, and the physical environment,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) written plans of care provided under subsection (b)(2) of this section and an audit of the residents&rsquo; assessments under subsection (b)(3) of this section to determine the accuracy of such assessments and the adequacy of such plans of care, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">If not otherwise conducted under subclause (I), a standard survey (or an abbreviated standard survey) may be conducted within 2 months of any change of ownership, administration, management of a skilled nursing facility, or the director of nursing in order to determine whether the change has resulted in any decline in the quality of care furnished in the facility.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1684 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extended surveys</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each skilled nursing facility which is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard quality of care shall be subject to an extended survey. Any other facility may, at the Secretary's or State's discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practicable, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In such an extended survey, the survey team shall review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard quality of care and shall determine whether the facility has complied with all the requirements described in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Such review shall include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents&rsquo; assessments reviewed and a review of the staffing, of in-service training, and, if appropriate, of contracts with consultants.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Construction</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Standard and extended surveys shall be conducted&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by individuals, of a survey team, who meet such minimum qualifications as the Secretary establishes by not later than such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The failure of the Secretary to develop, test, or validate such protocols or to establish such minimum qualifications shall not relieve any State of its responsibility (or the Secretary of the Secretary's responsibility) to conduct surveys under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Consistency of surveys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State and the Secretary shall implement programs to measure and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey results among surveyors.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall provide for the comprehensive training of State and Federal surveyors in the conduct of standard and extended surveys under this subsection, including the auditing of resident assessments and plans of care. No individual shall serve as a member of a survey team unless the individual has successfully completed a training and testing program in survey and certification techniques that has been approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Validation surveys</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of skilled nursing facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State's surveys conducted under paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the State has determined that an individual skilled nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to each State, the Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the number of skilled nursing facilities surveyed by the State in the year, but in no case less than 5 skilled nursing facilities in the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Remedies for substandard performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State's survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary shall provide for an appropriate remedy, which may include the training of survey teams in the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special surveys of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a skilled nursing facility with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the skilled nursing facility meets such requirements.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1685 --><h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Investigation of complaints and monitoring compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) investigate complaints of violations of requirements by skilled nursing facilities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) monitor, on-site, on a regular, as needed basis, a skilled nursing facility's compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the facility has been found not to be in compliance with such requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies to achieve such compliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the facility was previously found not to be in compliance with such requirements, has corrected deficiencies to achieve such compliance, and verification of continued compliance is indicated; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A State may maintain and utilize a specialized team (including an attorney, an auditor, and appropriate health care professionals) for the purpose of identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence, and carrying out appropriate enforcement actions against substandard skilled nursing facilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Disclosure of results of inspections and activities</h4>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a skilled nursing <!-- PDFPage:1686 -->facility's deficiencies. If the Secretary finds, or pursuant to the recommendation of the State under paragraph (1) finds, that a skilled nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (B)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consisting of surgery or any other service requiring the use of general anesthesia (other than surgical procedures specified by the Secretary under section 1395<em>l</em>(i)(1)(A) of this title), unless the attending physician certifies that the risk associated with transferring the patient to a hospital for such services outweighs the benefits of transferring the patient to a hospital for such services.<sup><a href="#1395i-4_2_target" name="1395i-4_2">2</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) meets such staffing requirements as would apply under section 1395x(e) of this title to a hospital located in a rural area, except that&mdash;</p>
