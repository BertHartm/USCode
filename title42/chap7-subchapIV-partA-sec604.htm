<h4 class="note-head">Assets for Independence</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 105&ndash;285, title IV, Oct. 27, 1998, 112 Stat. 2759, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Assets for Independence Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 402. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Economic well-being does not come solely from income, spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, investment, and accumulation of assets because assets can improve economic independence and stability, connect individuals with a viable and hopeful future, stimulate development of human and other capital, and enhance the welfare of offspring.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Fully 1/2 of all Americans have either no, negligible, or negative assets available for investment, just as the price of entry to the economic mainstream, the cost of a house, an adequate education, and starting a business, is increasing. Further, the household savings rate of the United States lags far behind other industrial nations, presenting a barrier to economic growth.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United States should invest existing resources in high-yield initiatives. There is reason to believe that the financial returns, including increased income, tax revenue, and decreased welfare cash assistance, re<!-- PDFPage:1300 -->sulting from individual development accounts will far exceed the cost of investment in those accounts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Traditional public assistance programs concentrating on income and consumption have rarely been successful in promoting and supporting the transition to increased economic self-sufficiency. Income-based domestic policy should be complemented with asset-based policy because, while income-based policies ensure that consumption needs (including food, child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, asset-based policies provide the means to achieve greater independence and economic well-being.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 403. PURPOSES.</h4>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the extent to which an asset-based policy that promotes saving for postsecondary education, homeownership, and microenterprise development may be used to enable individuals and families with limited means to increase their economic self-sufficiency; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the extent to which an asset-based policy stabilizes and improves families and the community in which the families live.</p>
