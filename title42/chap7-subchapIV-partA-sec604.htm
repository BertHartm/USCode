<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Assets for Independence Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 402. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Economic well-being does not come solely from income, spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, investment, and accumulation of assets because assets can improve economic independence and stability, connect individuals with a viable and hopeful future, stimulate development of human and other capital, and enhance the welfare of offspring.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Fully &frac12; of all Americans have either no, negligible, or negative assets available for investment, just as the price of entry to the economic mainstream, the cost of a house, an adequate education, and starting a business, is increasing. Further, the household savings rate of the United States lags far behind other industrial nations, presenting a barrier to economic growth.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United States should invest existing resources in high-yield initiatives. There is reason to believe that the financial returns, including increased income, tax revenue, and decreased welfare cash assistance, resulting from individual development accounts will far exceed the cost of investment in those accounts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Traditional public assistance programs concentrating on income and consumption have rarely been successful in promoting and supporting the transition to increased economic self-sufficiency. Income-based domestic policy should be complemented with asset-based policy because, while income-based policies ensure that consumption needs (including food, child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, asset-based policies provide the means to achieve greater independence and economic well-being.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 403. PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purposes of this title are to provide for the establishment of demonstration projects designed to determine&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the extent to which an asset-based policy that promotes saving for postsecondary education, homeownership, and microenterprise development may be used to enable individuals and families with limited means to increase their economic self-sufficiency; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the extent to which an asset-based policy stabilizes and improves families and the community in which the families live.</p>
