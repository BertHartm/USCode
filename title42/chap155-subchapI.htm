<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The goal for NASA's Earth Science program shall be to pursue a program of Earth observations, research, and applications activities to better understand the Earth, how it supports life, and how human activities affect its ability to do so in the future. In pursuit of this goal, NASA's Earth Science program shall ensure that securing practical benefits for society will be an important measure of its success in addition to securing new knowledge about the Earth system and climate change. In further pursuit of this goal, NASA shall, together with NOAA and other relevant agencies, provide United States leadership in developing and carrying out a cooperative international Earth observations-based research program.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that experimental NASA sensors and missions that have the potential to benefit society if transitioned into operational monitoring systems be transitioned into operational status whenever possible.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Interagency process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director of OSTP, in consultation with the Administrator, the Administrator of NOAA, and other relevant stakeholders, shall develop a process to transition, when appropriate, NASA Earth science and space weather missions or sensors into operational status. The process shall include coordination of annual agency budget requests as required to execute the transitions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Responsible agency official</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator and the Administrator of NOAA shall each designate an agency official who shall have the responsibility for and authority to lead NASA's and NOAA's transition activities and interagency coordination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each mission or sensor that is determined to be appropriate for transition under subsection (b), NASA and NOAA shall transmit to Congress a joint plan for conducting the transition. The plan shall include the strategy, milestones, and budget required to execute the transition. The transition plan shall be transmitted to Congress not later than 60 days after the successful completion of the mission or sensor critical design review.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reauthorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress reauthorizes NASA to continue with development of the Glory Mission, which will examine how aerosols and solar energy affect the Earth's climate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Baseline Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Pursuant to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Authorization Act of 2005 (Public Law 109&ndash;155) [42 U.S.C. 16601 et seq.], not later than 90 days after October 15, 2008, the Administrator shall transmit a new baseline report consistent with section 103(b)(2) of such Act [42 U.S.C. 16613(b)(2)]. The report shall include an analysis of the factors contributing to cost growth and the steps taken to address them.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall ensure that NASA gives high priority to those parts of its existing cooperative activities with NOAA that are related to the study of tornadoes and other severe storms, tornado-force winds, and other factors determined to influence the development of tornadoes and other severe storms, with the goal of improving the Nation's ability to predict tornados and other severe storms. Further, the Administrator shall examine whether there are additional cooperative activities with NOAA that should be undertaken in the area of tornado and severe storm research.</p>
