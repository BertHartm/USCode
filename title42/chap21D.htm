From this day forward, unless the Attorney General with appropriate consultation provides further guidance, officers, employees, and other agents of the United States Government may, in conducting interrogations, act in reliance upon Army Field Manual 2&ndash;22.3, but may not, in conducting interrogations, rely upon any interpretation of the law governing interrogation&mdash;including interpretations of Federal criminal laws, the Convention Against Torture, Common Article 3, Army Field Manual 2&ndash;22.3, and its predecessor document, Army Field Manual 34&ndash;52&mdash;issued by the Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and January 20, 2009.</p>

Good faith reliance on advice of counsel should be an important factor, among others, to consider in assessing whether a person of ordinary sense and understanding would have known the practices to be unlawful.
