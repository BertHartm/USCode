<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) under regulations prescribed by him, assign or sell at public or private sale, or otherwise dispose of for cash or credit, in his discretion and upon such terms and conditions and for such consideration as he shall determine to be reasonable, any evidence of debt, contract, claim, personal property, or security assigned to or held by him in connection with loans made or evidences of indebtedness purchased under this chapter, and collect or compromise all obligations assigned to or held by him in connection with such loans or evidences of indebtedness until such time as such obligations may be referred to the Attorney General for suit or collection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) further extend the maturity of or renew any loan made or evidence of indebtedness purchased under this chapter, beyond the periods stated in such loan or evidence of indebtedness or in this chapter, for additional periods not to exceed ten years, if such extension or renewal will aid in the orderly liquidation of such loan or evidence of indebtedness;</p>
