<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this division to authorize the establishment of a Civilian Community Corps to provide a basis for determining&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether residential service programs administered by the Federal Government can significantly increase the support for national service and community service by the people of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether such programs can expand the opportunities for willing young men and women to perform meaningful, direct, and consequential acts of community service in a manner that will enhance their own skills while contributing to their understanding of civic responsibility in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether retired members and former members of the Armed Forces of the United States, members and former members of the Armed Forces discharged or released from active duty in connection with reduced Depart<!-- PDFPage:6389 -->ment of Defense spending, members and former members of the Armed Forces discharged or transferred from the Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve in connection with reduced Department of Defense spending, and other members of the Armed Forces not on active duty and not actively participating in a reserve component of the Armed Forces can provide guidance and training under such programs that contribute meaningfully to the encouragement of national and community service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether domestic national service programs can serve as a substitute for the traditional option of military service in the Armed Forces of the United States which, in times of reductions in the size of the Armed Forces, is a diminishing national service opportunity for young Americans.</p>
