The term of initial members shall be computed from the date of the first meeting of the Board. The term of each member other than initial members shall be computed from the date of termination of the preceding term. Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which such member's predecessor was appointed shall be appointed for the remainder of such term. No member shall be reappointed to more than two consecutive terms immediately following such member's initial term.</p>

If ninety days have elapsed without such an advisory council appointed by the Governor, the Board is authorized to appoint such a council. The advisory council shall be charged with notifying the Corporation of any apparent violation of the provisions of this subchapter and applicable rules, regulations, and guidelines promulgated pursuant to this subchapter.
