<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a summary of past receipts and disbursements from the Fund;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a projection of any future funding needs remaining after the expiration of authority to collect taxes, and of the threat to public health, welfare, and the environment posed by the projected releases which create any such needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the record and experience of the Fund in recovering Fund disbursements from liable parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the record of State participation in the system of response, liability, and compensation established by this chapter;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(1) The area known as Love Canal located in the city of Niagara Falls and the town of Wheatfield, New York, was the first toxic waste site to receive national attention. As a result of that attention Congress investigated the problems associated with toxic waste sites and enacted CERCLA [Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 9601 et seq.)] to deal with these problems.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Because Love Canal came to the Nation's attention prior to the passage of CERCLA and because the fund under CERCLA was not available to compensate for all of the hardships endured by the citizens in the area, Congress has determined that special provisions are required. These provisions do not affect the lawfulness, implementation, or selection of any other response actions at Love Canal or at any other facilities.&rdquo;</p>
