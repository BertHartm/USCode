<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) approximately 700,000 youth enter the juvenile justice system every year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Federal, State, and local governments spend close to $2,000,000,000 a year confining many of those youth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) it is more effective in both human and fiscal terms to prevent delinquency than to attempt to control or change it after the fact;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) half or more of all States are unable to spend any juvenile justice formula grant funds on delinquency prevention because of other priorities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) few Federal resources are dedicated to delinquency prevention; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Federal incentives are needed to assist States and local communities in mobilizing delinquency prevention policies and programs.</p>
