<p class="statutory-body">Each State and unit of local government may receive payments under this subchapter only upon filing with the Secretary, at such time and in such manner as the Secretary prescribes by rule, a statement of assurances. Such rules shall be prescribed by the Secretary not later than ninety days after July 22, 1976. The Secretary may not require any State or local government to file more than one such statement during each fiscal year. Each such statement shall contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an assurance that payments made under this subchapter to the State or local government will be used for the maintenance, to the extent practical, of levels of public employment and of basic services customarily provided to persons in that State or in the area under the jurisdiction of that unit of local government which is consistent with the provisions of section 6724 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an assurance that the State or unit of local government will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) use fiscal, accounting, and audit procedures which conform to guidelines established therefor by the Secretary (after consultation with the Comptroller General of the United States), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provide to the Secretary (and to the Comptroller General of the United States), on reasonable notice, access to, and the right to examine, such books, documents, papers, or records as the Secretary may reasonably require for purposes of reviewing compliance with this subchapter;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an assurance that reasonable reports will be furnished to the Secretary in such form and containing such information as the Secretary may reasonably require to carry out the purposes of this subchapter and that such report shall be published in a newspaper of general circulation in the jurisdiction of such government unless the cost of such publication is excessive in relation to the amount of the payments received by such government under this subchapter or other means of publicizing such report is more appropriate, in which case such report shall be publicized pursuant to rules prescribed by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an assurance that the requirements of section 6727 of this title will be complied with;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) an assurance that the requirements of section 6728 of this title will be complied with;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) an assurance that the State or unit of local government will spend any payment it receives under this subchapter before the end of the six-calendar-month period which begins on the day after the date on which such State or local government receives such payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) an assurance that the State or unit of local government will spend amounts received under this subchapter only in accordance with the laws and procedures applicable to the expenditure of its own revenues.</p>
