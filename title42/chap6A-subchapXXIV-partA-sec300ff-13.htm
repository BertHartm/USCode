<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remainder of amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of funds to be obligated under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include amounts that are not paid to the eligible areas under expedited procedures under subsection (a)(2) of this section as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the failure of any eligible area to submit an application under section 300ff&ndash;15(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300ff-13_2_target" name="300ff-13_2">2</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
