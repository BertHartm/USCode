<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants based on relative need of area</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out section 300ff&ndash;11(a) of this title, the Secretary shall make a grant for each eligible area for which an application under section 300ff&ndash;15(a) of this title has been approved. Each such grant shall be made in an amount determined in accordance with paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Expedited distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 60 days after an appropriation becomes available to carry out this part for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall, except in the case of waivers granted under section 300ff&ndash;15(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300ff-13_1_target" name="300ff-13_1">1</a></sup> of this title, disburse 50 percent of the amount appropriated under section 300ff&ndash;77 of this title for such fiscal year through grants to eligible areas under section 300ff&ndash;11(a) of this title, in accordance with paragraph (3). The Secretary shall reserve an additional percentage of the amount appropriated under section 300ff&ndash;77 of this title for a fiscal year for grants under this part to make grants to eligible areas under section 300ff&ndash;11(a) of this title in accordance with paragraph (4).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amount of grant</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to the extent of amounts made available in appropriations Acts, a grant made for purposes of this paragraph to an eligible area shall be made in an amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an amount equal to the amount available for distribution under paragraph (2) for the fiscal year involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the percentage constituted by the ratio of the distribution factor for the eligible area to the sum of the respective distribution factors for all eligible areas.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Distribution factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the term &ldquo;distribution factor&rdquo; means an amount equal to the estimated number of living cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the eligible area involved, as determined under subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Estimate of living cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount determined in this subparagraph is an amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the eligible area during each year in the most recent 120-month period for which data are available with respect to all eligible areas, as indicated by the number of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for each year during such period, except that (subject to subparagraph (D)), for grants made pursuant to this paragraph for fiscal year 2005 and subsequent fiscal years, the cases counted for each 12-month period beginning on or after July 1, 2004, shall be cases of HIV disease (as reported to and confirmed by such Director) rather than cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the first year during such period, .06;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the second year during such period, .06;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the third year during such period, .08;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the fourth year during such period, .10;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) the fifth year during such period, .16;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VI) the sixth year during such period, .16;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VII) the seventh year during such period, .24;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(VIII) the eighth year during such period, .40;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IX) the ninth year during such period, .57; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(X) the tenth year during such period, .88.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The yearly percentage described in subparagraph (ii) shall be updated biennially by the Secretary, after consultation with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and shall be reported to the congressional committees of jurisdiction. The first such update shall occur prior to the determination of grant awards under this part for fiscal year 1998. Updates shall as applicable take into account the counting of cases of HIV disease pursuant to clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Determination of Secretary regarding data on HIV cases</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than July 1, 2004, the Secretary shall determine whether there is data on cases of HIV disease from all eligible areas (reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) sufficiently accurate and reliable for use for purposes of subparagraph (C)(i). In making such a determination, the Secretary shall take into consideration the findings of the study under section 501(b) of the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 (relating to the relationship between epidemiological measures and health care for certain individuals with HIV disease).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Effect of adverse determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If under clause (i) the Secretary determines that data on cases of HIV disease is not sufficiently accurate and reliable for use for purposes of subparagraph (C)(i), then notwithstanding such subparagraph, for any fiscal year prior to fiscal year 2007 the references in such subparagraph to cases of HIV disease do not have any legal effect.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Grants and technical assistance regarding counting of HIV cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Of the amounts appropriated under section 247c&ndash;2 of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall reserve amounts to <!-- PDFPage:1027 -->make grants and provide technical assistance to States and eligible areas with respect to obtaining data on cases of HIV disease to ensure that data on such cases is available from all States and eligible areas as soon as is practicable but not later than the beginning of fiscal year 2007.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Unexpended funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may, in determining the amount of a grant for a fiscal year under this paragraph, adjust the grant amount to reflect the amount of unexpended and uncanceled grant funds remaining at the end of the fiscal year preceding the year for which the grant determination is to be made. The amount of any such unexpended funds shall be determined using the financial status report of the grantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Increases in grant</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each fiscal year in a protection period for an eligible area, the Secretary shall increase the amount of the grant made pursuant to paragraph (2) for the area to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for the first fiscal year in the protection period, the grant is not less than 98 percent of the amount of the grant made for the eligible area pursuant to such paragraph for the base year for the protection period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for any second fiscal year in such period, the grant is not less than 95 percent of the amount of such base year grant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for any third fiscal year in such period, the grant is not less than 92 percent of the amount of the base year grant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) for any fourth fiscal year in such period, the grant is not less than 89 percent of the amount of the base year grant; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) for any fifth or subsequent fiscal year in such period, if, pursuant to paragraph (3)(D)(ii), the references in paragraph (3)(C)(i) to HIV disease do not have any legal effect, the grant is not less than 85 percent of the amount of the base year grant.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for fiscal year 2005, pursuant to paragraph (3)(D)(ii), data on cases of HIV disease are used for purposes of paragraph (3)(C)(i), the Secretary shall increase the amount of a grant made pursuant to paragraph (2) for an eligible area to ensure that the grant is not less than 98 percent of the amount of the grant made for the area in fiscal year 2004.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Base year; protection period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to grants made pursuant to paragraph (2) for an eligible area:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The base year for a protection period is the fiscal year preceding the trigger grant-reduction year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The first trigger grant-reduction year is the first fiscal year (after fiscal year 2000) for which the grant for the area is less than the grant for the area for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) A protection period begins with the trigger grant-reduction year and continues until the beginning of the first fiscal year for which the amount of the grant determined pursuant to paragraph (2) for the area equals or exceeds the amount of the grant determined under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Any subsequent trigger grant-reduction year is the first fiscal year, after the end of the preceding protection period, for which the amount of the grant is less than the amount of the grant for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Supplemental grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 150 days after the date on which appropriations are made under section 300ff&ndash;77 of this title for a fiscal year, the Secretary shall disburse the remainder of amounts not disbursed under subsection (a)(2) of this section for such fiscal year for the purpose of making grants under section 300ff&ndash;11(a) of this title to eligible areas whose application under section 300ff&ndash;15(b) of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) contains a report concerning the dissemination of emergency relief funds under subsection (a) of this section and the plan for utilization of such funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) demonstrates the severe need in such area for supplemental financial assistance to combat the HIV epidemic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) demonstrates the existing commitment of local resources of the area, both financial and in-kind, to combating the HIV epidemic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) demonstrates the ability of the area to utilize such supplemental financial resources in a manner that is immediately responsive and cost effective;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) demonstrates that resources will be allocated in accordance with the local demographic incidence of AIDS including appropriate allocations for services for infants, children, youth, women, and families with HIV disease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) demonstrates the inclusiveness of the planning council membership, with particular emphasis on affected communities and individuals with HIV disease; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) demonstrates the manner in which the proposed services are consistent with the local needs assessment and the statewide coordinated statement of need.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of grant</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of each grant made for purposes of this subsection shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighting of factors under paragraph (1), with severe need under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph counting one-third.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Severe need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining severe need in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall consider the ability of the qualified applicant to expend funds efficiently and the impact of relevant factors on the cost and complexity of delivering health care and support services to individuals with HIV disease in the eligible area, including factors such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, tuberculosis, severe mental <!-- PDFPage:1028 -->illness, or other comorbid factors determined relevant by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) new or growing subpopulations of individuals with HIV disease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) homelessness;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the current prevalence of HIV disease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) an increasing need for HIV-related services, including relative rates of increase in the number of cases of HIV disease; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) unmet need for such services, as determined under section 300ff&ndash;12(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prevalence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the impact of the factors described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, use national, quantitative incidence data that are available for each eligible area. Not later than 18 months after October 20, 2000, the Secretary shall develop a mechanism to utilize such data. Such a mechanism shall be modified to reflect the findings of the study under section 501(b) of the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 (relating to the relationship between epidemiological measures and health care for certain individuals with HIV disease). In the absence of such data, the Secretary may consider a detailed description and qualitative analysis of severe need, as determined under subparagraph (B), including any local prevalence data gathered and analyzed by the eligible area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsequent to the development of the quantitative mechanism described in subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall phase in, over a 3-year period beginning in fiscal year 1998, the use of such a mechanism to determine the severe need of an eligible area compared to other eligible areas and to determine, in part, the amount of supplemental funds awarded to the eligible area under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remainder of amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of funds to be obligated under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include amounts that are not paid to the eligible areas under expedited procedures under subsection (a)(2) of this section as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the failure of any eligible area to submit an application under section 300ff&ndash;15(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300ff-13_2_target" name="300ff-13_2">2</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any eligible area informing the Secretary that such eligible area does not intend to expend the full amount of its grant under such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to submit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The failure of an eligible area to submit an application for an expedited grant under subsection (a)(2) of this section shall not result in such area being ineligible for a grant under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The application of an eligible area submitted under section 300ff&ndash;15(b) of this title shall contain the assurances required under subsection (a) of such section if such eligible area fails to submit an application for an expedited grant under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compliance with priorities of HIV planning council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Secretary, in carrying out section 300ff&ndash;11(a) of this title, may not make any grant under subsection (a) or (b) of this section to an eligible area unless the application submitted by such area under section 300ff&ndash;15 of this title for the grant involved demonstrates that the grants made under subsections (a) and (b) of this section to the area for the preceding fiscal year (if any) were expended in accordance with the priorities applicable to such year that were established, pursuant to section 300ff&ndash;12(b)(4)(C) of this title, by the planning council serving the area.</p>
