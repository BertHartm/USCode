<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to assure that the policies of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 [42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.] and other provisions of law which further the purposes of such Act (as specified in regulations issued by the Secretary) are most effectively implemented in connection with the expenditure of funds under this chapter, and to assure to the public undiminished protection of the environment, the Secretary, in lieu of the environmental protection procedures otherwise applicable, may under regulations provide for the release of funds for particular <!-- PDFPage:4681 -->projects to recipients of assistance under this chapter who assume all of the responsibilities for environmental review, decisionmaking, and action pursuant to such Act, and such other provisions of law as the regulations of the Secretary specify, that would apply to the Secretary were he to undertake such projects as Federal projects. The Secretary shall issue regulations to carry out this subsection only after consultation with the Council on Environmental Quality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall approve the release of funds for projects subject to the procedures authorized by this subsection only if, at least fifteen days prior to such approval and prior to any commitment of funds to such projects other than for purposes authorized by section 5305(a)(12) of this title or for environmental studies, the recipient of assistance under this chapter has submitted to the Secretary a request for such release accompanied by a certification which meets the requirements of paragraph (3).

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of grants made to States pursuant to section 5306(d) of this title, the State shall perform those actions of the Secretary described in paragraph (2) and the performance of such actions shall be deemed to satisfy the Secretary's responsibilities referred to in the second sentence of such paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Units of general local government receiving assistance under this chapter may receive funds, in one payment, in an amount not to exceed the total amount designated in the grant (or, in the case of a unit of general local government receiving a distribution from a State pursuant to section 5306(d) of this title, not to exceed the total amount of such distribution) for use in establishing a revolving loan fund which is to be established in a private financial institution and which is to be used to finance rehabilitation activities assisted under this chapter. Rehabilitation activities authorized under this section shall begin within 45 days after receipt of such payment and substantial disbursements from such fund must begin within 180 days after receipt of such payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall establish standards for such cash payments which will insure that the deposits result in appropriate benefits in support of the recipient's rehabilitation program. These standards shall be designed to assure that the benefits to be derived from the local program include, at a minimum, one or more of the following elements, or such other criteria as determined by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) leverage of community development block grant funds so that participating financial institutions commit private funds for loans in the rehabilitation program in amounts substantially in excess of deposit of community development funds;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Retention of program income; condition of distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any unit of general local government may retain any program income that is realized from any grant made by the Secretary, or any amount distributed by a State, under section 5306 of this title if (1) such income was realized after the initial disbursement of the funds received by such unit of general local government under such section; and (2) such unit of general local government has agreed that it will utilize the program income for eligible community development activities in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; except that the Secretary may, by regulation, exclude from consideration as program income any amounts determined to be so small that compliance with this subsection creates an unreasonable administrative burden on the unit of general local government. A State may require as a condition of any amount distributed by such State under section 5306(d) of this title <!-- PDFPage:4682 -->that a unit of general local government shall pay to such State any such income to be used by such State to fund additional eligible community development activities, except that such State shall waive such condition to the extent such income is applied to continue the activity from which such income was derived.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Provision of benefits to displaced persons</h4>
