Except as provided in the next 2 sentences, any school participating in food service programs under this chapter may refuse to accept delivery of not more than 20 percent of the total value of agricultural commodities and other foods tendered to it in any school year; and if a school so refuses, that school may receive, in lieu of the refused commodities, other commodities to the extent that other commodities are available to the State during that year. Any school food authority may refuse some or all of the fresh fruits and vegetables offered to the school food authority in any school year and shall receive, in lieu of the offered fruits and vegetables, other more desirable fresh fruits and vegetables that are at least equal in value to the fresh fruits and vegetables refused by the school food authority. The value of any fresh fruits and vegetables refused by a school under the preceding sentence for a school year shall not be used to determine the 20 percent of the total value of agricultural commodities and other foods tendered to the school food authority in the school year under the second sentence. The provisions of law contained in the proviso of section 713c of title 15, facilitating operations with respect to the purchase and disposition of surplus agricultural commodities under section 612c of title 7, shall, to the extent not inconsistent with the provision of this chapter, also be applicable to expenditures of funds by the Secretary under this chapter. In making purchases of such agricultural commodities and other foods, the Secretary shall not issue specifications which restrict participation of local producers unless such specifications will result in significant advantages to the food service programs authorized by this chapter and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Delivery of commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall deliver, to each State participating in the school lunch program under this chapter, commodities valued at the total level of assistance authorized under subsection (c) of this section for each school year for the school lunch program in the State, not later than September 30 of the following school year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interim source of funds, pending supplemental appropriation of additional funds for carrying out subsection (b)</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary, until such time as a supplemental appropriation may provide additional funds for the purpose of subsection (b) of this section, shall use funds appropriated by section 612c of title 7 to make any payments to States authorized under such subsection. Any section 612c of title 7 funds utilized to make such payments shall be reimbursed out of any supplemental appropriation hereafter enacted for the purpose of carrying out subsection (b) of this section and such reimbursement shall be deposited into the fund established pursuant to section 612c of title 7 to be available for the purpose of said section 612c of title 7.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) State matching provisions inapplicable to subsection (b) or (c) funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any funds made available under subsection (b) or (c) of this section shall not be subject to the State matching provisions of section 1756 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Level of commodity assistance; computation of index; calculation of total assistance to each State; emphasis on high protein foods; per meal value of donated foods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The national average value of donated foods, or cash payments in lieu thereof, shall be 11 cents, adjusted on July 1, 1982, and each July 1 thereafter to reflect changes in the Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions. The Index shall be computed using 5 major food components in the Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; Producer Price Index (cereal and bakery products, meats, poultry and fish, dairy products, processed fruits and vegetables, and fats and oils). Each component shall be weighed using the same relative weight as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The value of food assistance for each meal shall be adjusted each July 1 by the annual percentage change in a 3-month average value of the Price Index for Foods Used in Schools and Institutions for March, April, and May each year. Such adjustment shall be computed to the nearest 1/4 cent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For each school year, the total commodity assistance or cash in lieu thereof available to a <!-- PDFPage:2425 -->State for the school lunch program shall be calculated by multiplying the number of lunches served in the preceding school year by the rate established by subparagraph (B). After the end of each school year, the Secretary shall reconcile the number of lunches served by schools in each State with the number of lunches served by schools in each State during the preceding school year and increase or reduce subsequent commodity assistance or cash in lieu thereof provided to each State based on such reconciliation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Among those commodities delivered under this section, the Secretary shall give special emphasis to high protein foods, meat, and meat alternates (which may include domestic seafood commodities and their products).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, not less than 75 percent of the assistance provided under this subsection shall be in the form of donated foods for the school lunch program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the maximum extent feasible, each State agency shall offer to each school food authority under its jurisdiction that participates in the school lunch program and receives commodities, agricultural commodities and their products, the per meal value of which is not less than the national average value of donated foods established under paragraph (1). Each such offer shall include the full range of such commodities and products that are available from the Secretary to the extent that quantities requested are sufficient to allow efficient delivery to and within the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Termination of commodity assistance based upon school breakfast program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning with the school year ending June 30, 1981, the Secretary shall not offer commodity assistance based upon the number of breakfasts served to children under section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 [42 U.S.C. 1773].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Minimum percentage of commodity assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), in each school year the Secretary shall ensure that not less than 12 percent of the assistance provided under section 1753 of this title, this section, and section 1759a of this title shall be in the form of commodity assistance provided under this section, including cash in lieu of commodities and administrative costs for procurement of commodities under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If amounts available to carry out the requirements of the sections described in paragraph (1) are insufficient to meet the requirement contained in paragraph (1) for a school year, the Secretary shall, to the extent necessary, use the authority provided under section 1762a(a) of this title to meet the requirement for the school year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Funds appropriated to carry out section 1753 of this title during any fiscal year shall be available for payment to the States for disbursement by State educational agencies in accordance with such agreements, not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, as may be entered into by the Secretary and such State educational agencies for the purpose of assisting schools within the States in obtaining agricultural commodities and other foods for consumption by children in furtherance of the school lunch program authorized under this chapter. For any school year, such payments shall be made to a State only if, during such school year, the amount of the State revenues (excluding State revenues derived from the operation of the program) appropriated or used specifically for program purposes (other than any State revenues expended for salaries and administrative expenses of the program at the State level) is not less than 30 percent of the funds made available to such State under section 1753 of this title for the school year beginning July 1, 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If, for any school year, the per capita income of a State is less than the average per capita income of all the States, the amount required to be expended by a State under paragraph (1) for such year shall be an amount bearing the same ratio to the amount equal to 30 percent of the funds made available to such State under section 1753 of this title for the school year beginning July 1, 1980, as the per capita income of such State bears to the average per capita income of all the States.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification of payments by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall certify to the Secretary of the Treasury, from time to time, the amounts to be paid to any State under this section and shall specify when such payments are to be made.

The State shall forward any remaining payment due a service institution not later than seventy-five days following receipt of valid claims. If the State has reason to believe that a service institution will not be able to submit a valid claim for reimbursement covering the period for which an advance program payment has been made, the subsequent month's advance program payment shall be withheld until such time as the State has received a valid claim. Program payments advanced to service institutions that are not subsequently deducted from a valid claim for reimbursement shall be repaid upon demand by the State.

For the purposes of this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;bonus commodities&rdquo; means commodities provided in addition to commodities provided pursuant to section 1755(e) of this title; and</p>

The amount of cash payments in the case of lunches shall be governed by section 1755(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When such payments are made, the State educational agency shall promptly and equitably disburse any cash it receives in lieu of commodities to eligible schools and institutions, and such disbursements shall be used by such schools and institutions to purchase United States agricultural commodities and other foods for their food service programs.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Grants-in-aid; &ldquo;institution&rdquo; defined; guidelines for institutions providing care to children outside of school hours; eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may carry out a program to assist States through grants-in-aid and other means to initiate, maintain, and expand nonprofit food service programs for children in institutions providing child care. For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;institution&rdquo; means any public or private nonprofit organization providing nonresidential child care, including, but not limited to, child care centers, settlement houses, recreational centers, Head Start centers, and institutions providing child care facilities for children with handicaps; and such term shall also mean any other private organization providing nonresidential day care services for which it receives compensation from amounts granted to the States under title XX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq.] (but only if such organization receives compensation under such title for at least 25 percent of its enrolled children or 25 percent of its licensed capacity, whichever is less). In addition, the term &ldquo;institution&rdquo; shall include programs developed to provide day care outside school hours for schoolchildren, and public or nonprofit private organizations that sponsor family or group day care homes. Reimbursement may be provided <!-- PDFPage:2458 -->under this section only for meals or supplements served to children not over 12 years of age (except that such age limitation shall not be applicable for children of migrant workers if 15 years of age or less or for children with handicaps). The Secretary may establish separate guidelines for institutions that provide care to school children outside of school hours. For purposes of determining eligibility&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) no institution, other than a family or group day care home sponsoring organization, or family or group day care home shall be eligible to participate in the program unless it has Federal, State, or local licensing or approval, or is complying with appropriate renewal procedures as prescribed by the Secretary and the State has no information indicating that the institution's license will not be renewed; or where Federal, State, or local licensing or approval is not available, it receives funds under title XX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq.] or otherwise demonstrates that it meets either any applicable State or local government licensing or approval standards or approval standards established by the Secretary after consultation with the Secretary of Health and Human Services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no institution shall be eligible to participate in the program unless it satisfies the following criteria:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has not been seriously deficient in its operation of the child care food program, or any other program under this chapter or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 [42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq.], for a period of time specified by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) will provide adequate supervisory and operational personnel for overall monitoring and management of the child care food program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on cash assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the fiscal year ending September 30, 1979, and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide cash assistance to States for meals as provided in subsection (f) of this section, except that, in any fiscal year, the aggregate amount of assistance provided to a State by the Secretary under this section shall not exceed the sum of (1) the Federal funds provided by the State to participating institutions within the State for that fiscal year and (2) any funds used by the State under section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 [42 U.S.C. 1779].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Formula for computation of payments; national average payment rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of this section, the national average payment rate for free lunches and suppers, the national average payment rate for reduced price lunches and suppers, and the national average payment rate for paid lunches and suppers shall be the same as the national average payment rates for free lunches, reduced price lunches, and paid lunches, respectively, under sections 1753 and 1759a of this title as appropriate (as adjusted pursuant to section 1759a(a) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this section, the national average payment rate for free breakfasts, the national average payment rate for reduced price breakfasts, and the national average payment rate for paid breakfasts shall be the same as the national average payment rates for free breakfasts, reduced price breakfasts, and paid breakfasts, respectively, under section 4(b) of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 [42 U.S.C. 1773(b)] (as adjusted pursuant to section 1759a(a) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, the national average payment rate for free supplements shall be 30 cents, the national average payment rate for reduced price supplements shall be one-half the rate for free supplements, and the national average payment rate for paid supplements shall be 2.75 cents (as adjusted pursuant to section 1759a(a) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Determinations with regard to eligibility for free and reduced price meals and supplements shall be made in accordance with the income eligibility guidelines for free lunches and reduced price lunches, respectively, under section 1758 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) A child shall be considered automatically eligible for benefits under this section without further application or eligibility determination, if the child is enrolled as a participant in a Head Start program authorized under the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9831 et seq.), on the basis of a determination that the child is a member of a family that meets the low-income criteria prescribed under section 645(a)(1)(A) of the Head Start Act (42 U.S.C. 9840(a)(1)(A)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) A child who has not yet entered kindergarten shall be considered automatically eligible for benefits under this section without further application or eligibility determination if the child is enrolled as a participant in the Even Start program under part B of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 2741 et seq.).<sup><a href="#1766_1_target" name="1766_1">1</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall apply only with respect to the provision of benefits under this section for the period beginning September 1, 1995, and ending September 30, 1997.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Requirements for approval; notification; reapplication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any eligible public institution shall be approved for participation in the child care food program upon its request. Any eligible private institution shall be approved for participation if it (A) has tax exempt status under title 26 or, under conditions established by the Secretary, is moving toward compliance with the requirements for tax exempt status, or (B) is currently operating a Federal program requiring nonprofit status. Family or group day care homes need not have individual tax exempt certification if they are sponsored by an institution that has tax exempt status, or, under conditions established by the Secretary, such institution is moving toward compliance with the requirements for tax exempt status or is currently operating a Federal program requiring nonprofit status. An institution applying for participation under this section shall be notified of approval or dis<!-- PDFPage:2459 -->approval in writing within thirty days after the date its completed application is filed. If an institution submits an incomplete application to the State, the State shall so notify the institution within fifteen days of receipt of the application, and shall provide technical assistance, if necessary, to the institution for the purpose of completing its application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall develop a policy that allows institutions providing child care that participate in the program under this section, at the option of the State agency, to reapply for assistance under this section at 3-year intervals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each State agency that exercises the option authorized by subparagraph (A) shall confirm on an annual basis that each such institution is in compliance with the licensing or approval provisions of subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the State shall provide, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, a fair hearing and a prompt determination to any institution aggrieved by the action of the State as it affects the participation of such institution in the program authorized by this section, or its claim for reimbursement under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A State is not required to provide a hearing to an institution concerning a State action taken on the basis of a Federal audit determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a State does not provide a hearing to an institution concerning a State action taken on the basis of a Federal audit determination, the Secretary, on request, shall afford a hearing to the institution concerning the action.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) State disbursement to institutions; time of payment; notification; maximum per meal reimbursement rate; election of manner of reimbursement by certain institutions; reimbursement of administrative expenses; start-up and expansion funds; advance payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Funds paid to any State under this section shall be disbursed to eligible institutions by the State under agreements approved by the Secretary. Disbursements to any institution shall be made only for the purpose of assisting in providing meals to children attending institutions, or in family or group day care homes. Disbursement to any institution shall not be dependent upon the collection of moneys from participating children. All valid claims from such institutions shall be paid within forty-five days of receipt by the State. The State shall notify the institution within fifteen days of receipt of a claim if the claim as submitted is not valid because it is incomplete or incorrect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, the disbursement for any fiscal year to any State for disbursement to institutions, other than family or group day care home sponsoring organizations, for meals provided under this section shall be equal to the sum of the products obtained by multiplying the total number of each type of meal (breakfast, lunch or supper, or supplement) served in such institution in that fiscal year by the applicable national average payment rate for each such type of meal, as determined under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) No reimbursement may be made to any institution under this paragraph, or to family or group day care home sponsoring organizations under paragraph (3) of this subsection, for more than two meals and one supplement per day per child, or in the case of an institution (but not in the case of a family or group day care home sponsoring organization), two meals and two supplements or three meals and one supplement per day per child, for children that are maintained in a child care setting for eight or more hours per day.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Institutions that participate in the program under this section as family or group day care home sponsoring organizations shall be provided, for payment to such homes, a reimbursement factor set by the Secretary for the cost of obtaining and preparing food and prescribed labor costs, involved in providing meals under this section, without a requirement for documentation of such costs, except that reimbursement shall not be provided under this subparagraph for meals or supplements served to the children of a person acting as a family or group day care home provider unless such children meet the eligibility standards for free or reduced price meals under section 1758 of this title. The reimbursement factor in effect as of August 13, 1981, shall be reduced by 10 percent. The reimbursement factor under this subparagraph shall be adjusted on July 1 of each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for food away from home for the most recent 12-month period for which such data are available. The reimbursement factor under this subparagraph shall be rounded to the nearest one-fourth cent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Family or group day care home sponsoring organizations shall also receive reimbursement for their administrative expenses in amounts not exceeding the maximum allowable levels prescribed by the Secretary. Such levels shall be adjusted July 1 of each year to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index for all items for the most recent 12-month period for which such data are available. The maximum allowable levels for administrative expense payments, as in effect as of August 13, 1981, shall be adjusted by the Secretary so as to achieve a 10 percent reduction in the total amount of reimbursement provided to institutions for such administrative expenses. In making the reduction required by the preceding sentence, the Secretary shall increase the economy of scale factors used to distinguish institutions that sponsor a greater number of family or group day care homes from those that sponsor a lesser number of such homes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Reimbursement for administrative expenses shall also include start-up funds to finance the administrative expenses for such institutions to initiate successful operation under the program and expansion funds to finance the administrative expenses for such institutions to expand into low-income or rural areas. Institutions that have received start-up funds may also apply at a later date for expansion funds. Such start-up funds and expansion funds shall be in addition to other reimbursement to such institutions for administrative expenses. Start-up funds and expansion funds shall be payable to <!-- PDFPage:2460 -->enable institutions satisfying the criteria of subsection (d) of this section, and any other standards prescribed by the Secretary, to develop an application for participation in the program as a family or group day care home sponsoring organization or to implement the program upon approval of the application. Such start-up funds and expansion funds shall be payable in accordance with the procedures prescribed by the Secretary. The amount of start-up funds and expansion funds payable to an institution shall be not less than the institution's anticipated reimbursement for administrative expenses under the program for one month and not more than the institution's anticipated reimbursement for administrative expenses under the program for two months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Funds for administrative expenses may be used by family or group day care home sponsoring organizations to conduct outreach and recruitment to unlicensed family or group day care homes so that the day care homes may become licensed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) By the first day of each month of operation, the State shall provide advance payments for the month to each approved institution in an amount that reflects the full level of valid claims customarily received from such institution for one month's operation. In the case of a newly participating institution, the amount of the advance shall reflect the State's best estimate of the level of valid claims such institutions will submit. If the State has reason to believe that an institution will not be able to submit a valid claim covering the period for which such an advance has been made, the subsequent month's advance payment shall be withheld until the State receives a valid claim. Payments advanced to institutions that are not subsequently deducted from a valid claim for reimbursement shall be repaid upon demand by the State. Any prior payment that is under dispute may be subtracted from an advance payment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Meals served by participating institutions; compliance assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Meals served by institutions participating in the program under this section shall consist of a combination of foods that meet minimum nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary on the basis of tested nutritional research. Such meals shall be served free to needy children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to those institutions participating in the program under this section to assist the institutions and family or group day care home sponsoring organizations in complying with the nutritional requirements prescribed by the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (A). The Secretary shall provide additional technical assistance to those institutions and family or group day care home sponsoring organizations that are having difficulty maintaining compliance with the requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No physical segregation or other discrimination against any child shall be made because of his or her inability to pay, nor shall there be any overt identification of any such child by special tokens or tickets, different meals or meal service, announced or published lists of names, or other means.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each institution shall, insofar as practicable, use in its food service foods designated from time to time by the Secretary as being in abundance, either nationally or in the food service area, or foods donated by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Donation of agricultural commodities by Secretary; measurement of value; annual readjustment of assistance; cash in lieu of commodities; Department of Defense child care feeding program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall donate agricultural commodities produced in the United States for use in institutions participating in the child care food program under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The value of the commodities donated under subparagraph (A) (or cash in lieu of commodities) to each State for each school year shall be, at a minimum, the amount obtained by multiplying the number of lunches and suppers served in participating institutions in that State during the preceding school year by the rate for commodities or cash in lieu of commodities established under section 1755(e) of this title for the school year concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) After the end of each school year, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) reconcile the number of lunches and suppers served in participating institutions in each State during such school year with the number of lunches and suppers served by participating institutions in each State during the preceding school year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) based on such reconciliation, increase or reduce subsequent commodity assistance or cash in lieu of commodities provided to each State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Any State receiving assistance under this section for institutions participating in the child care food program may, upon application to the Secretary, receive cash in lieu of some or all of the commodities to which it would otherwise be entitled under this subsection. In determining whether to request cash in lieu of commodities, the State shall base its decision on the preferences of individual participating institutions within the State, unless this proves impracticable due to the small number of institutions preferring donated commodities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary is authorized to provide agricultural commodities obtained by the Secretary under the provisions of the Agricultural Act of 1949 (7 U.S.C. 1421 et seq.) and donated under the provisions of section 416 of such Act [7 U.S.C. 1431], to the Department of Defense for use by its institutions providing child care services, when such commodities are in excess of the quantities needed to meet the needs of all other child nutrition programs, domestic and foreign food assistance and export enhancement programs. The Secretary shall require reimbursement from the Department of Defense for the costs, or some portion thereof, of delivering such commodities to overseas locations, unless the Secretary determines that it is in the best interest of the program that the Department of Agriculture shall assume such costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Availability of money for audits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall make available for each fiscal year to States administering the child <!-- PDFPage:2461 -->care food program, for the purpose of conducting audits of participating institutions, an amount up to 2 percent of the funds used by each State in the program under this section, during the second preceding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Standard form agreement regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may issue regulations directing States to develop and provide for the use of a standard form of agreement between each family or group day care sponsoring organization and the family or group day care homes participating in the program under such organization, for the purpose of specifying the rights and responsibilities of each party.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Training and technical assistance; demonstration projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) States participating in the program under this section shall provide sufficient training, technical assistance, and monitoring to facilitate expansion and effective operation of the program, and shall take affirmative action to expand the availability of benefits under this section. Such action, at a minimum, shall include annual notification to each nonparticipating institution or family or group day care home within the State that is licensed, approved, or registered, or that receives funds under title XX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq.], of the availability of the program, the requirements for program participation, and the application procedures to be followed in the program. The list of institutions so notified each year shall be available to the public upon request. The Secretary shall assist the States in developing plans to fulfill the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall conduct demonstration projects to test innovative approaches to remove or reduce barriers to participation in the program established under this section regarding family or group day care homes that operate in low-income areas or that primarily serve low-income children. As part of such demonstration projects, the Secretary may provide grants to, or otherwise modify administrative reimbursement rates for, family or group day care home sponsoring organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary and the States shall provide training and technical assistance to assist family and group day care home sponsoring organizations in reaching low-income children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall instruct States to provide, through sponsoring organizations, information and training concerning child health and development to family or group day care homes participating in the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Non-diminishment of State and local funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Expenditures of funds from State and local sources for the maintenance of food programs for children shall not be diminished as a result of funds received under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Accounts and records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">States and institutions participating in the program under this section shall keep such accounts and records as may be necessary to enable the Secretary to determine whether there has been compliance with the requirements of this section. Such accounts and records shall be available at all times for inspection and audit by representatives of the Secretary, the Comptroller General of the United States, and appropriate State representatives and shall be preserved for such period of time, not in excess of five years, as the Secretary determines necessary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are hereby authorized to be appropriated for each fiscal year such funds as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section.</p>
