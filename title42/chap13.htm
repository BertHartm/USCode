Except as provided in the next 2 sentences, any school participating in food service programs under this chapter may refuse to accept delivery of not more than 20 percent of the <!-- PDFPage:2876 -->total value of agricultural commodities and other foods tendered to it in any school year; and if a school so refuses, that school may receive, in lieu of the refused commodities, other commodities to the extent that other commodities are available to the State during that year. Any school food authority may refuse some or all of the fresh fruits and vegetables offered to the school food authority in any school year and shall receive, in lieu of the offered fruits and vegetables, other more desirable fresh fruits and vegetables that are at least equal in value to the fresh fruits and vegetables refused by the school food authority. The value of any fresh fruits and vegetables refused by a school under the preceding sentence for a school year shall not be used to determine the 20 percent of the total value of agricultural commodities and other foods tendered to the school food authority in the school year under the second sentence. The provisions of law contained in the proviso of section 713c of title 15, facilitating operations with respect to the purchase and disposition of surplus agricultural commodities under section 612c of title 7, shall, to the extent not inconsistent with the provision of this chapter, also be applicable to expenditures of funds by the Secretary under this chapter. In making purchases of such agricultural commodities and other foods, the Secretary shall not issue specifications which restrict participation of local producers unless such specifications will result in significant advantages to the food service programs authorized by this chapter and the Child Nutrition Act of 1966.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Delivery of commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall deliver, to each State participating in the school lunch program under this chapter, commodities valued at the total level of assistance authorized under subsection (c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1755_1_target" name="1755_1">1</a></sup> of this section for each school year for the school lunch program in the State, not later than September 30 of the following school year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Level of commodity assistance; computation of index; calculation of total assistance to each State; emphasis on high protein foods; per meal value of donated foods</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The national average value of donated foods, or cash payments in lieu thereof, shall be 11 cents, adjusted on July 1, 1982, and each July 1 thereafter to reflect changes in the Price Index for Food Used in Schools and Institutions. The Index shall be computed using 5 major food components in the Bureau of Labor Statistics&rsquo; Producer Price Index (cereal and bakery products, meats, poultry and fish, dairy products, processed fruits and vegetables, and fats and oils). Each component shall be weighed using the same relative weight as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The value of food assistance for each meal shall be adjusted each July 1 by the annual percentage change in a 3-month average value of the Price Index for Foods Used in Schools and Institutions for March, April, and May each year. Such adjustment shall be computed to the nearest 1/4 cent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For each school year, the total commodity assistance or cash in lieu thereof available to a State for the school lunch program shall be calculated by multiplying the number of lunches served in the preceding school year by the rate established by subparagraph (B). After the end of each school year, the Secretary shall reconcile the number of lunches served by schools in each State with the number of lunches served by schools in each State during the preceding school year and increase or reduce subsequent commodity assistance or cash in lieu thereof provided to each State based on such reconciliation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Among those commodities delivered under this section, the Secretary shall give special emphasis to high protein foods, meat, and meat alternates (which may include domestic seafood commodities and their products).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, not less than 75 percent of the assistance provided under this subsection shall be in the form of donated foods for the school lunch program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the maximum extent feasible, each State agency shall offer to each school food authority under its jurisdiction that participates in the school lunch program and receives commodities, agricultural commodities and their products, the per meal value of which is not less than the national average value of donated foods established under paragraph (1). Each such offer shall include the full range of such commodities and products that are available from the Secretary to the extent that quantities requested are sufficient to allow efficient delivery to and within the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Termination of commodity assistance based upon school breakfast program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Beginning with the school year ending June 30, 1981, the Secretary shall not offer commodity assistance based upon the number of breakfasts served to children under section 4 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 [42 U.S.C. 1773].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Minimum percentage of commodity assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), in each school year the Secretary shall ensure that not less than 12 percent of the assistance provided under section 1753 of this title, this section, and section 1759a of this title shall be in the form of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) commodity assistance provided under this section, including cash in lieu of commodities and administrative costs for procurement of commodities under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) during the period beginning October 1, 2000, and ending September 30, 2009, commodities provided by the Secretary under any provision of law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If amounts available to carry out the requirements of the sections described in paragraph (1) are insufficient to meet the requirement contained in paragraph (1) for a school year, the Secretary shall, to the extent necessary, use the authority provided under section 1762a(a) of this title to meet the requirement for the school year.</p>

For any school year, such payments shall be made to a State only if, during such school year, the amount of the State revenues (excluding State revenues derived from the operation of the program) appropriated or used specifically for program purposes (other than any State revenues expended for salaries and administrative expenses of the program at the State level) is not less than 30 percent of the funds made available to such State under section 1753 of this title for the school year beginning July 1, 1980.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a determination whether adjustments in the maximum reimbursement levels for food service operation costs prescribed in paragraph (1) of this subsection should be made, including whether different reimbursement levels should be established for self-prepared meals and vendored meals and which site-related costs, if any, should be considered as part of administrative costs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall also study the administrative costs of service institutions participating in the program and shall thereafter prescribe maximum allowable levels for administrative payments that reflect the costs of such service institutions, taking into account the number of sites and children served, and such other factors as the Secretary determines appropriate to further the goals of efficient and effective administration of the program.</p>

For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;institution&rdquo; means any public or private nonprofit organization providing nonresidential child care, including, but not limited to, child care centers, settlement houses, recreational centers, Head Start centers, and institutions providing child care facilities for children with disabilities; and such term shall also mean any other private organization providing nonresidential day care services for which it receives compensation from amounts granted to the States under title XX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1397 et seq.] (but only if such organization receives compensation under such title for at least 25 percent of its enrolled children or 25 percent of its licensed capacity, whichever is less). In addition, the term &ldquo;institution&rdquo; shall include programs developed to provide day care outside school hours for schoolchildren, public or nonprofit private organizations that sponsor family or group day care homes, and emergency shelters (as provided in subsection (t) of this section). Except as provided in subsection (r) of this section, reimbursement may be provided under this section only for meals or supplements served to children not over 12 years of age (except that such age limitation shall not be applicable for children of migrant workers if 15 years of age or less or for children with disabilities).

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations on cash assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the fiscal year ending September 30, 1979, and for each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary shall provide cash assistance to States for meals as provided in subsection (f) of this section, except that, in any fiscal year, the aggregate amount of assistance provided to a State by the Secretary under this section shall not exceed the sum of (1) the Federal funds provided by the State to participating institutions within the State for that fiscal year and (2) any funds used by the State under section 10 of the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 [42 U.S.C. 1779].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) A child who has not yet entered kindergarten shall be considered automatically eligible for benefits under this section without further application or eligibility determination if the child is enrolled as a participant in the Even Start program under part B of chapter 1 of title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 2741 et seq.).<sup><a href="#1766_1_target" name="1766_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any eligible public institution shall be approved for participation in the child care food program upon its request.

Family or group day care homes need not have individual tax exempt certification if they are sponsored by an institution that has tax exempt status, or, under conditions established by the Secretary, such institution is moving toward compliance with the requirements for tax exempt status or is currently operating a Federal program requiring nonprofit status. An institution moving toward compliance with the requirement for tax exempt status shall be allowed to participate in the child and adult care food program for a period of not more than 180 days, except that a State agency may grant a single extension of not to exceed an additional 90 days if the institution demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the State agency, that the inability of the institution to obtain tax exempt status within the 180-day period is due to circumstances beyond the control of the institution. An institution applying for participation under this section shall be notified of approval or disapproval in writing within thirty days after the date its completed application is filed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall develop a policy that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) allows institutions providing child care that participate in the program under this section, at the option of the State agency, to reapply for assistance under this section at 3-year intervals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) requires periodic site visits to private institutions that the State agency determines have a high probability of program abuse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), the State shall provide, in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary, a fair hearing and a prompt determination to any institution aggrieved by the action of the State as it affects the participation of such institution in the program authorized by this section, or its claim for reimbursement under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is likely to have a significant adverse effect on competition or prices in the relevant market or nationally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) will interfere with the ability of a local agency to procure a needed product for a child nutrition program;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) is likely to have significant adverse economic impacts on the local economy in a manner that is unfair to innocent parties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) is not justified in light of the penalties already imposed on the contractor for violations relevant to the proposed debarment, including any suspension or debarment arising out of the same matter that is imposed by any Federal or State agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) is not in the public interest, or otherwise is not in the interests of justice, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
