The evaluations will be submitted to the Secretary who will compile the results of projects funded by this section and submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress. The emphasis of this program must focus on the improvement of the placement rate&mdash;not the aggregate number of special needs children placed in permanent homes. The Secretary, when reviewing grant applications&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5113_1_target" name="5113_1">1</a></sup> shall give priority to grantees who propose improvements designed to continue in the absence of Federal funds.</p>
