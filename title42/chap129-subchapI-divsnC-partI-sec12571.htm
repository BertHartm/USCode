<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Federal agency that enters into an interagency agreement under paragraph (1) shall, in an appropriate case, enter into a contract or cooperative agreement with an entity that is carrying out a national service program in a State that is in existence in the State as of the date of the contract or cooperative agreement and is of high quality, in order to support the national service program.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Application of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A requirement under this chapter that applies to an entity receiving assistance under this section (other than a requirement limited to an entity receiving assistance under subsection (a)) shall be considered to apply to a Federal agency that enters into an interagency agreement under this subsection, even though no Federal agency may receive financial assistance under such an agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision of approved national service positions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rules on use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation may by rule prescribe the manner and extent to which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assistance provided under subsection (a) may be used to cover administrative costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that portion of the assistance available to cover administrative costs should be distributed between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the original recipient of the grant or transfer of assistance under such subsection; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Corporation may waive in whole or in part the requirements of paragraph (1) with respect to a national service program in any fiscal year if the Corporation determines that such a waiver would be equitable due to a lack of available financial resources at the local level.</p>
