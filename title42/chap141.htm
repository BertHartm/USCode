<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that a priority goal of constructing the International Space Station is the economic development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further declares that free and competitive markets create the most efficient conditions for promoting economic development, and should therefore govern the economic development of Earth orbital space. The Congress further declares that the use of free market principles in operating, servicing, allocating the use of, and adding capabilities to the Space Station, and the resulting fullest possible engagement of commercial providers and participation of commercial users, will reduce Space Station operational costs for all partners and the Federal Government's share of the United States burden to fund operations.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6363 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within 90 days after October 28, 1998, a study that identifies and examines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the opportunities for commercial providers to play a role in International Space Station activities, including operation, use, servicing, and augmentation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the potential cost savings to be derived from commercial providers playing a role in each of these activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) which of the opportunities described in subparagraph (A) the Administrator plans to make available to commercial providers in fiscal years 1999 and 2000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the specific policies and initiatives the Administrator is advancing to encourage and facilitate these commercial opportunities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the revenues and cost reimbursements to the Federal Government from commercial users of the Space Station.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall deliver to the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate, within 180 days after October 28, 1998, an independently conducted market study that examines and evaluates potential industry interest in providing commercial goods and services for the operation, servicing, and augmentation of the International Space Station, and in the commercial use of the International Space Station. This study shall also include updates to the cost savings and revenue estimates made in the study described in paragraph (1) based on the external market assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Administrator shall deliver to the Congress, no later than the submission of the President's annual budget request for fiscal year 2000, a report detailing how many proposals (whether solicited or not) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration received during calendar years 1997 and 1998 regarding commercial operation, servicing, utilization, or augmentation of the International Space Station, broken down by each of these four categories, and specifying how many agreements the National Aeronautics and Space Administration has entered into in response to these proposals, also broken down by these four categories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each of the studies and reports required by paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) shall include consideration of the potential role of State governments as brokers in promoting commercial participation in the International Space Station program.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Government shall not be required to acquire space transportation services under subsection (a) of this section if, on a case-by-case basis, the Administrator or, in the case of a national security issue, the Secretary of the Air Force, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a payload requires the unique capabilities of the Space Shuttle;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) cost effective space transportation services that meet specific mission requirements would not be reasonably available from United States commercial providers when required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers poses an unacceptable risk of loss of a unique scientific opportunity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers is inconsistent with national security objectives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the use of space transportation services from United States commercial providers is inconsistent with international agreements for international collaborative efforts relating to science and technology;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) it is more cost effective to transport a payload in conjunction with a test or demonstration of a space transportation vehicle owned by the Federal Government; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a payload can make use of the available cargo space on a Space Shuttle mission as a secondary payload, and such payload is consistent with the requirements of research, development, demonstration, scientific, commercial, and educational programs authorized by the Administrator.</p>

As part of those preparations, the Administrator shall plan for the potential privatization of the Space Shuttle program. Such plan shall keep safety and cost effectiveness as high priorities. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the National Aeronautics and Space Administration from studying, designing, developing, or funding upgrades or modifications essential to the safe and economical operation of the Space Shuttle fleet.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Feasibility study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall conduct a study of the feasibility of implementing the recommendation of the Independent Shuttle Management Review Team that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration transition toward the privatization of the Space Shuttle. The study shall identify, discuss, and, where possible, present options for resolving, the major policy and legal issues that must be addressed before the Space Shuttle is privatized, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whether the Federal Government or the Space Shuttle contractor should own the Space Shuttle orbiters and ground facilities;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:6366 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether the Federal Government should indemnify the contractor for any third party liability arising from Space Shuttle operations, and, if so, under what terms and conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether payloads other than National Aeronautics and Space Administration payloads should be allowed to be launched on the Space Shuttle, how missions will be prioritized, and who will decide which mission flies and when;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) whether commercial payloads should be allowed to be launched on the Space Shuttle and whether any classes of payloads should be made ineligible for launch consideration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whether National Aeronautics and Space Administration and other Federal Government payloads should have priority over non-Federal payloads in the Space Shuttle launch assignments, and what policies should be developed to prioritize among payloads generally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) whether the public interest requires that certain Space Shuttle functions continue to be performed by the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) how much cost savings, if any, will be generated by privatization of the Space Shuttle.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 60 days after October 28, 1998, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration shall complete the study required under subsection (b) of this section and shall submit a report on the study to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate and the Committee on Science of the House of Representatives.</p>
