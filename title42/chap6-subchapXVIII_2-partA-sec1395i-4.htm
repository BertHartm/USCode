<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is located in a rural area (as defined in section 1395ww(d)(2)(D) of this title), or is located in a county whose geographic area is substantially larger than the average geographic area for urban counties in the United States and whose hospital service area is characteristic of service areas of hospitals located in rural areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at the time such facility applies to the State for designation as a rural primary care hospital, is a hospital (or, in the case of a facility that closed during the 12-month period that ends on the date the facility applies for such designation, at the time the facility closed),<sup><a href="#1395i-4_1_target" name="1395i-4_1">1</a></sup> with a participation agreement in effect under section 1395cc(a) of this title and had not been found, on the basis of a survey under section 1395aa of this title, to be in violation of any requirement to participate as a hospital under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) has ceased, or agrees (upon the approval of such application) to cease, providing inpatient care (except as required under subparagraph (F));</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of a facility that is a member of a rural health network, has in effect an agreement to participate with other hospitals and facilities in the communications system of such network, including the network's system for the electronic sharing of patient data, including telemetry and medical records, if the network has in operation such a system;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to any patient whose attending physician does not certify that the patient may reasonably be expected to be discharged or transferred to a hospital within 72 hours of admission to the facility; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) consisting of surgery or any other service requiring the use of general anesthesia (other than surgical procedures specified by the Secretary under section 1395<em>l</em>(i)(1)(A) of this title), unless the attending physician certifies that the risk associated with transferring the patient to a hospital for such services outweighs the benefits of transferring the patient to a hospital for such services.<sup><a href="#1395i-4_2_target" name="1395i-4_2">2</a></sup></p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) meets such staffing requirements as would apply under section 1395x(e) of this title to a hospital located in a rural area, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the facility need not meet hospital standards relating to the number of hours during a day, or days during a week, in which the facility must be open, except insofar as the facility is required to provide emergency care on a 24-hour basis under subparagraph (E),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the facility may provide any services otherwise required to be provided by a full-time, on-site dietician, pharmacist, laboratory technician, medical technologist, and radiological technologist on a part-time, off-site basis, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the inpatient care described in subparagraph (F) may be provided by a physician's assistant or nurse practitioner, subject to the oversight of a physician; and</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Preference given to hospitals or facilities participating in rural health network</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In designating facilities as rural primary care hospitals under paragraph (1), the State shall give preference to hospitals or facilities participating in a rural health network.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Permitting rural primary care hospitals to maintain swing beds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to prohibit a State from designating a facility as a rural primary care hospital solely because, at the time the facility applies to the State for designation as a rural primary care hospital, there is in effect an agreement between the facility and the Secretary under section 1395tt of this title under which the facility's inpatient hospital facilities are used for the furnishing of extended care services, except that the number of beds used for the furnishing of such services may not exceed the total number of licensed inpatient beds at the time the facility applies to the State for such designation (minus the number of inpatient beds used for providing inpatient care pursuant to paragraph (1)(F)). For purposes of the previous sentence, the number of beds of the facility used for the furnishing of extended care services shall not include any beds of a unit of the facility that is licensed as a distinct-part skilled nursing facility at the time the facility applies to the State for designation as a rural primary care hospital.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may terminate a designation of a rural primary care hospital under paragraph (1) if the Secretary finds that the average length of stay for inpatients at the facility during the previous year in which the designation was in effect exceeded 72 hours. In determining the compliance of a facility with the requirement of the previous sentence, there shall not be taken into account periods of stay of inpatients in excess of 72 hours to the extent such periods exceed 72 hours because transfer to a hospital is precluded because of inclement weather or other emergency conditions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) &ldquo;Rural health network&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;rural health network&rdquo; means, with respect to a State, an organization&mdash;</p>
