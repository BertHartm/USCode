<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Attorney General shall not establish a national standard under this section that would impose substantial additional costs compared to the costs presently expended by Federal, State, and local prison authorities.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 90 days of publishing the final rule under paragraph (1), the Attorney General shall transmit the national standards adopted under such paragraph to the chief executive of each State, the head of the department of corrections of each State, and to the appropriate authorities in those units of local government who oversee operations in one or more prisons.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For each fiscal year, any amount that a State would otherwise receive for prison purposes for that fiscal year under a grant program covered by this subsection shall be reduced by 5 percent, unless the chief executive of the State submits to the Attorney General&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a certification that the State has adopted, and is in full compliance with, the national standards described in subsection (a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an assurance that not less than 5 percent of such amount shall be used only for the purpose of enabling the State to adopt, and achieve full compliance with, those national standards, so as to ensure that a certification under subparagraph (A) may be submitted in future years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report on noncompliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than September 30 of each year, the Attorney General shall publish a report listing each grantee that is not in compliance with the national standards adopted pursuant to subsection (a).</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Redistribution of amounts</h4>
