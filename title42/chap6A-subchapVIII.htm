To the extent practical, entities which receive grants or contracts under this subsection shall encourage familiy&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300_1_target" name="300_1">1</a></sup> participation in projects assisted under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Factors determining awards; establishment and preservation of rights of local and regional entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making grants and contracts under this section the Secretary shall take into account the number of patients to be served, the extent to which family planning services are needed locally, the relative need of the applicant, and its capacity to make rapid and effective use of such assistance. Local and regional entities shall be assured the right to apply for direct grants and contracts under this section, and the Secretary shall by regulation fully provide for and protect such right.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reduction of grant amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, at the request of a recipient of a grant under subsection (a) of this section, may reduce the amount of such grant by the fair market value of any supplies or equipment furnished the grant recipient by the Secretary. The amount by which any such grant is so reduced shall be available for payment by the Secretary of the costs incurred in furnishing the supplies or equipment on which the reduction of such grant is based. Such amount shall be deemed as part of the grant and shall be deemed to have been paid to the grant recipient.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">The Title X &ldquo;Gag Rule&rdquo;</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 22, 1993, 58 F.R. 7455, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Secretary of Health and Human Services</p>
<p class="note-body">Title X of the Public Health Services Act [42 U.S.C. 300 et seq.] provides Federal funding for family planning clinics to provide services for low-income patients. The Act specifies that Title X funds may not be used for the performance of abortions, but places no restrictions on the ability of clinics that receive Title X funds to provide abortion counseling and referrals or to perform abortions using non-Title X funds. During the first 18 years of the program, medical professionals at Title X clinics provided complete, uncensored information, including nondirective abortion counseling. In February 1988, the Department of Health and Human Services adopted regulations, which have become known as the &ldquo;Gag Rule,&rdquo; prohibiting Title X recipients from providing their patients with information, counseling, or referrals concerning abortion. Subsequent attempts by the Bush Administration to modify the Gag Rule and ensuing litigation have created confusion and uncertainty about the current legal status of the regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Gag Rule endangers women's lives and health by preventing them from receiving complete and accurate medical information and interferes with the doctor-patient relationship by prohibiting information that medical professionals are otherwise ethically and legally required to provide to their patients. Furthermore, the Gag Rule contravenes the clear intent of a majority of the members of both the United States Senate and House of Representatives, which twice passed legislation to block the Gag Rule's enforcement but failed to override Presidential vetoes.</p>
<p class="note-body">For these reasons, you have informed me that you will suspend the Gag Rule pending the promulgation of new regulations in accordance with the &ldquo;notice and comment&rdquo; procedures of the Administrative Procedure Act [5 U.S.C. 551 et seq.]. I hereby direct you to take that action as soon as possible. I further direct that, within 30 days, you publish in the Federal Register new proposed regulations for public comment.</p>
<p class="note-body">You are hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
