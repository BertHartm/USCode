<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any case where payment under this subchapter is made to a person other than the qualified individual entitled to the payment, the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish a system of accountability monitoring under which the person shall report not less often than annually with respect to the use of the payments.

The Commissioner of Social Security shall make a good faith effort to obtain restitution from the terminated representative payee.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security finds that more or less than the correct amount of payment has been made to any person under this subchapter, proper adjustment or recovery shall be made, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) With respect to payment to a person of more than the correct amount, the Commissioner of Social Security shall decrease any payment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) under this subchapter to which the overpaid person (if a qualified individual) is entitled, or shall require the overpaid person <!-- PDFPage:1664 -->or his or her estate to refund the amount in excess of the correct amount, or, if recovery is not obtained under these two methods, shall seek or pursue recovery by means of reduction in tax refunds based on notice to the Secretary of the Treasury, as authorized under section 3720A of title 31; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) under subchapter II of this chapter to recover the amount in excess of the correct amount, if the person is not currently eligible for payment under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) With respect to payment of less than the correct amount to a qualified individual who, at the time the Commissioner of Social Security is prepared to take action with respect to the underpayment&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is deceased, the balance of the amount due shall revert to the general fund of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) No effect on subchapter VIII eligibility or benefit amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which the Commissioner of Social Security takes action in accordance with subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section to recover an amount incorrectly paid to an individual, that individual shall not, as a result of such action&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if such individual is otherwise so qualified, become qualified for increased benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of recovery of overpayment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any case in which more than the correct amount of payment has been made, there shall be no adjustment of payments to, or recovery by the United States from, any person who is without fault if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that the adjustment or recovery would defeat the purpose of this subchapter or would be against equity and good conscience.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limited immunity for disbursing officers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A disbursing officer may not be held liable for any amount paid by the officer if the adjustment or recovery of the amount is waived under subsection (b) of this section, or adjustment under subsection (a) of this section is not completed before the death of the qualified individual against whose benefits deductions are authorized.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Commissioner of Social Security shall make findings of fact and decisions as to the rights of any individual applying for payment under this subchapter. The Commissioner of Social Security shall provide reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing to any individual who is or claims to be a qualified individual and is in disagreement with any determination under this subchapter with respect to entitlement to, or the amount of, benefits under this subchapter, if the individual requests a hearing on the matter in disagreement within 60 days after notice of the determination is received, and, if a hearing is held, shall, on the basis of evidence adduced at the hearing affirm, modify, or reverse the Commissioner of Social Security's findings of fact and the decision. The Commissioner of Social Security may, on the Commissioner of Social Security's own motion, hold such hearings and conduct such investigations and other proceedings as the Commissioner of Social Security deems necessary or proper for the administration of this subchapter. In the course of any hearing, investigation, or other proceeding, the Commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence. Evidence may be received at any hearing before the Commissioner of Social Security even though inadmissible under the rules of evidence applicable to court procedure. The Commissioner of Social Security shall specifically take into account any physical, mental, educational, or linguistic limitation of the individual (including any lack of facility with the English language) in determining, with respect to the entitlement of the individual for benefits under this subchapter, whether the individual acted in good faith or was at fault, and in determining fraud, deception, or intent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effect of failure to timely request review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A failure to timely request review of an initial adverse determination with respect to an application for any payment under this subchapter or an adverse determination on reconsideration of such an initial determination shall not serve as a basis for denial of a subsequent application for any payment under this subchapter if the applicant demonstrates that the applicant failed to so request such a review acting in good faith reliance upon incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information, relating to the consequences of reapplying for <!-- PDFPage:1665 -->payments in lieu of seeking review of an adverse determination, provided by any officer or employee of the Social Security Administration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any notice of an adverse determination with respect to which a review may be requested under paragraph (1), the Commissioner of Social Security shall describe in clear and specific language the effect on possible entitlement to benefits under this subchapter of choosing to reapply in lieu of requesting review of the determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The final determination of the Commissioner of Social Security after a hearing under subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be subject to judicial review as provided in section 405(g) of this title to the same extent as the Commissioner of Social Security's final determinations under section 405 of this title.</p>
