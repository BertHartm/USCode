<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in subsection (a) of this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;assistance from the State&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1394 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assistance under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter or under the State plan approved under part A of this subchapter (as in effect on the day before August 22, 1996); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) foster care maintenance payments under the State plan approved under part E of this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Federal share&rdquo; means that portion of the amount collected resulting from the application of the Federal medical assistance percentage in effect for the fiscal year in which the amount is distributed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Federal medical assistance percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;Federal medical assistance percentage&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Federal medical assistance percentage (as defined in section 1396d(b) of this title, as such section was in effect on September 30, 1995) in the case of any other State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) State share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The term &ldquo;State share&rdquo; means 100 percent minus the Federal share.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Hold-harmless provision</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the State share of amounts collected in the fiscal year which could be retained to reimburse the State for amounts paid to families as assistance by the State is less than the State share of such amounts collected in fiscal year 1995 (determined in accordance with this section as in effect on August 21, 1996); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) the State has distributed to families that include an adult receiving assistance under the program under part A of this subchapter at least 80 percent of the current support payments collected during the preceding fiscal year on behalf of such families, and the amounts distributed were disregarded in determining the amount or type of assistance provided under the program under part A of this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the State has distributed to families that formerly received assistance under the program under part A of this subchapter the State share of the amounts collected pursuant to section 664 of this title that could have been retained as reimbursement for assistance paid to such families,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the State share otherwise determined for the fiscal year shall be increased by an amount equal to one-half of the amount (if any) by which the State share for fiscal year 1995 exceeds the State share for the fiscal year (determined without regard to this subsection).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Gap payments not subject to distribution under this section</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At State option, this section shall not apply to any amount collected on behalf of a family as support by the State (and paid to the family in addition to the amount of assistance otherwise payable to the family) pursuant to a plan approved under this part if such amount would have been paid to the family by the State under section 602(a)(28) of this title, as in effect and applied on the day before August 22, 1996. For purposes of subsection (d) of this section, the State share of such amount paid to the family shall be considered amounts which could be retained by the State if such payments were reported by the State as part of the State share of amounts collected in fiscal year 1995.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Amounts collected for child for whom foster care maintenance payments are made</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this section, amounts collected by a State as child support for months in any period on behalf of a child for whom a public agency is making foster care maintenance payments under part E of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall be retained by the State to the extent necessary to reimburse it for the foster care maintenance payments made with respect to the child during such period (with appropriate reimbursement of the Federal Government to the extent of its participation in the financing);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be paid to the public agency responsible for supervising the placement of the child to the extent that the amounts collected exceed the foster care maintenance payments made with respect to the child during such period but not the amounts required by a court or administrative order to be paid as support on behalf of the child during such period; and the responsible agency may use the payments in the manner it determines will serve the best interests of the child, including setting such payments aside for the child's future needs or making all or a part thereof available to the person responsible for meeting the child's day-to-day needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) shall be retained by the State, if any portion of the amounts collected remains after making the payments required under paragraphs (1) and (2), to the extent that such portion is necessary to reimburse the State (with appropriate reimbursement to the Federal Government to the extent of its participation in the financing) for any past foster care maintenance payments (or payments of assistance under the State program funded under part A of this subchapter) which were made with respect to the child (and with respect to which past collections have not previously been retained);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and any balance shall be paid to the State agency responsible for supervising the placement of the child, for use by such agency in accordance with paragraph (2).</p>
