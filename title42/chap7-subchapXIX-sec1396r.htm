<p class="statutory-body-2em">A nursing facility must maintain a quality assessment and assurance committee, consisting of the director of nursing services, a physician designated by the facility, and at least 3 other members of the facility's staff, which (i) meets at least quarterly to identify issues with respect to which quality assessment and assurance activities are necessary and (ii) develops and implements appropriate plans of action to correct identified quality deficiencies.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of services and activities under plan of care</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A nursing facility must provide services and activities to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident in accordance with a written plan of care which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is initially prepared, with the participation to the extent practicable of the resident or the resident's family or legal representative, by a team which includes the resident's attending physician and a registered professional nurse with responsibility for the resident; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) is periodically reviewed and revised by such team after each assessment under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Residents&rsquo; assessment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Requirement</h4>

Each individual who completes a portion of such an assessment shall sign and certify as to the accuracy of that portion of the assessment.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Penalty for falsification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) An individual who willfully and knowingly certifies under clause (i) a material and false statement in a resident assessment is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $1,000 with respect to each assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) An individual who willfully and knowingly causes another individual to certify under clause (i) a material and false statement in a resident assessment is subject to a civil money penalty of not more than $5,000 with respect to each assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this clause in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Use of independent assessors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a State determines, under a survey under subsection (g) of this section or otherwise, that there has been a knowing and willful certification of false assessments under this paragraph, the State may require (for a period specified by the State) that resident assessments under this paragraph be conducted and certified by individuals who are independent of the facility and who are approved by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Frequency</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is mentally ill (as defined in subsection (e)(7)(G)(i) of this section) unless the State mental health authority has determined (based on an independent physical and mental evaluation performed by a person or entity other than the State mental health authority) prior to admission that, because of the physical and mental condition of the individual, the individual requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility, and, if the individual requires such level of services, whether the individual requires specialized services for mental illness, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) is mentally retarded (as defined in subsection (e)(7)(G)(ii) of this section) unless the State mental retardation or developmental disability authority has determined prior to admission that, because of the physical and mental condition of the individual, the individual requires the level of services provided by a nursing facility, and, if the individual requires such level of services, whether the individual requires specialized services for mental retardation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) the State finds that, for any such periods in which licensed nursing services are not available, a registered professional nurse or a physician is obligated to respond immediately to telephone calls from the facility,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) the State agency granting a waiver of such requirements provides notice of the waiver to the State long-term care ombudsman (established under section 307(a)(12)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396r_1_target" name="1396r_1">1</a></sup> of the Older Americans Act of 1965) and the protection and advocacy system in the State for the mentally ill and the mentally retarded, and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;A waiver under this clause shall be subject to annual review and to the review of the Secretary and subject to clause (iii) shall be accepted by the Secretary for purposes of this subchapter to the same extent as is the State's certification of the facility. In granting or renewing a waiver, a State may require the facility to use other qualified, licensed personnel.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Assumption of waiver authority by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the Secretary determines that a State has shown a clear pattern and practice of allowing waivers in the absence of diligent efforts by facilities to meet the staffing requirements, the Secretary shall assume and exercise the authority of the State to grant waivers.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Re-training required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A), if, since an individual's most recent completion of a training and competency evaluation program, there has been a continuous period of 24 consecutive months during none of which the individual performed nursing or nursing-related services for monetary compensation, such individual shall complete a new training and competency evaluation program, or a new competency evaluation program.</p>

If the State has determined that an individual nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State's survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary may provide for the training of survey teams in the State and shall provide for a reduction of the payment otherwise made to the State under section 1396b(a)(2)(D) of this title with respect to a quarter equal to 33 percent multiplied by a fraction, the denominator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities surveyed by the Secretary that quarter and the numerator of which is equal to the total number of residents in nursing facilities which were found pursuant to such surveys to be not in compliance with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. A State that is dissatisfied with the Secretary's findings under this subparagraph may obtain reconsideration and review of the findings under section 1316 of this title in the same manner as a State may seek reconsideration and review under that section of the Secretary's determination under section 1316(a)(1) of this title.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specified remedies</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) A civil money penalty assessed and collected, with interest, for each day in which the facility is or was out of compliance with a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section. Funds collected by a State as a result of imposition of such a penalty (or as a result of the imposition by the State of a civil money penalty for activities described in subsections (b)(3)(B)(ii)(I), (b)(3)(B)(ii)(II), or (g)(2)(A)(i) of this section) shall be applied to the protection of the health or property of residents of nursing facilities that the State or the Secretary finds deficient, including payment for the costs of relocation of residents to other facilities, maintenance of operation of a facility pending correction of deficiencies or closure, and reimbursement of residents for personal funds lost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The appointment of temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility's residents, where there is a need for temporary management while&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the State has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The State also shall specify criteria, as to when and how each of such remedies is to be applied, the amounts of any fines, and the severity of each of these remedies, to be used in the imposition of such remedies. Such criteria shall be designed so as to minimize the time between the identification of violations and final imposition of the remedies and shall provide for the imposition of incrementally more severe fines for repeated or uncorrected deficiencies. In addition, the State may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Deadline and guidance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), as a condition for approval of a State plan for calendar quarters beginning on or after October 1, 1989, each State shall establish the remedies described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A) by not later than October 1, 1989. The Secretary shall provide, through regulations by not later than October 1, 1988, guidance to States in establishing such remedies; but the failure of the Secretary to provide such guidance shall not relieve a State of the responsibility for establishing such remedies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) A State may establish alternative remedies (other than termination of participation) other than those described in clauses (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (A), if the State demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that the alternative remedies are as effective in deterring noncompliance and correcting deficiencies as those described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Assuring prompt compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a nursing facility has not complied with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, within 3 months after the date the facility is found to be out of compliance with such requirements, the State shall impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i) for all individuals who are admitted to the facility after such date.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a nursing facility which, on 3 consecutive standard surveys conducted under subsection (g)(2) of this section, has been found to have provided substandard quality of care, the State shall (regardless of what other remedies are provided)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) impose the remedy described in subparagraph (A)(i), and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a nursing facility's deficiencies. If the Secretary finds that a nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (C)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) if the Secretary, but not the State, finds that the facility's participation under the State plan should be terminated, the Secretary shall (pending any termination by the Secretary) permit continuation of payments in accordance with paragraph (3)(D); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) if the State, but not the Secretary, finds that the facility's participation under the State plan should be terminated, the State's decision to terminate, and timing of such termination, shall control; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B)(i) if the Secretary or the State, but not both, establishes one or more remedies which are additional or alternative to the remedy of terminating the facility's participation under the State plan, such additional or alternative remedies shall also be applied, or</p>
