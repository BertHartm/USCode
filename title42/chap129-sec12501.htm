<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Throughout the United States, there are pressing unmet human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Americans desire to affirm common responsibilities and shared values, and join together in positive experiences, that transcend race, religion, gender, age, disability, region, income, and education.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The rising costs of postsecondary education are putting higher education out of reach for an increasing number of citizens.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Americans of all ages can improve their communities and become better citizens through service to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Nonprofit organizations, local governments, States, and the Federal Government are already supporting a wide variety of national service programs that deliver needed services in a cost-effective manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Residents of low-income communities, especially youth and young adults, can be empowered through their service, and can help provide future community leadership.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) meet the unmet human, educational, environmental, and public safety needs of the United States, without displacing existing workers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) renew the ethic of civic responsibility and the spirit of community throughout the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) expand educational opportunity by rewarding individuals who participate in national service with an increased ability to pursue higher education or job training;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) encourage citizens of the United States, regardless of age, income, or disability, to engage in full-time or part-time national service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) reinvent government to eliminate duplication, support locally established initiatives, require measurable goals for performance, and offer flexibility in meeting those goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) expand and strengthen existing service programs with demonstrated experience in providing structured service opportunities with visible benefits to the participants and community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) build on the existing organizational service infrastructure of Federal, State, and local programs and agencies to expand full-time and part-time service opportunities for all citizens; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) provide tangible benefits to the communities in which national service is performed.</p>
