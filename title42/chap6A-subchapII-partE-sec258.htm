<p class="statutory-body">Narcotic addicts or other persons with drug abuse and drug dependence problems in hospitals of the Service designated for their care shall be employed in such manner and under such conditions as the Surgeon General may direct. In such hospitals the Surgeon General may, in his discretion, establish industries, plants, factories, or shops for the production and manufacture of articles, commodities, and supplies for the United States Government. The Secretary of the Treasury may require any Government department, establishment, or other institution, for whom appropriations are made directly or indirectly by the Congress of the United States, to purchase at current market prices, as determined by him or his authorized representative, such of the articles, commodities, or supplies so produced or manufactured as meet their specifications; and the Surgeon General shall provide for payment to the inmates or their dependents of such pecuniary earnings as he may deem proper. The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall establish a working-capital fund for such industries, plants, factories, and shops out of any funds appropriated for Public Health Service hospitals at which addicts or other persons with drug abuse and drug dependence problems are treated and cared for; and such fund shall be available for the purchase, repair, or replacement of machinery or equipment, for the purchase of raw materials and supplies, for the purchase of uniforms and other distinctive wearing apparel of employees in the performance of their official duties, and for the employment of necessary civilian officers and employees. The Surgeon General may provide for the disposal of products of the industrial activities conducted pursuant to this section, and the proceeds of any sales thereof shall be covered into the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the working-capital fund.</p>
