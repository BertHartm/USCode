<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an agreement that the entity will report to the Secretary such interests identified by the entity and how any such interests identified by the entity will be managed or eliminated in order that the project in question will be protected from bias that may stem from such interests; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an agreement that the entity will comply with regulations issued under this section.</p>
