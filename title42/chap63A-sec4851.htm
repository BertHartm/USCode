<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) low-level lead poisoning is widespread among American children, afflicting as many as 3,000,000 children under age 6, with minority and low-income communities disproportionately affected;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) at low levels, lead poisoning in children causes intelligence quotient deficiencies, reading and learning disabilities, impaired hearing, reduced attention span, hyperactivity, and behavior problems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) pre-1980 American housing stock contains more than 3,000,000 tons of lead in the form of lead-based paint, with the vast majority of homes built before 1950 containing substantial amounts of lead-based paint;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the ingestion of household dust containing lead from deteriorating or abraded lead-based paint is the most common cause of lead poisoning in children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the health and development of children living in as many as 3,800,000 American homes is endangered by chipping or peeling lead paint, or excessive amounts of lead-contaminated dust in their homes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the danger posed by lead-based paint hazards can be reduced by abating lead-based paint or by taking interim measures to prevent paint deterioration and limit children's exposure to lead dust and chips;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) despite the enactment of laws in the early 1970's requiring the Federal Government to eliminate as far as practicable lead-based paint hazards in federally owned, assisted, and insured housing, the Federal response to this national crisis remains severely limited; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the Federal Government must take a leadership role in building the infrastructure&mdash;including an informed public, State and local delivery systems, certified inspectors, contractors, and laboratories, trained workers, and available financing and insurance&mdash;necessary to ensure that the national goal of eliminating lead-based paint hazards in housing can be achieved as expeditiously as possible.</p>
