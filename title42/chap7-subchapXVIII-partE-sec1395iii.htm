<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There shall be available to the Fund, for expenditures from the Fund for services furnished during&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) fiscal year 2014, $20,740,000,000;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) fiscal year 2015, $550,000,000; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) fiscal year 2020 and each subsequent fiscal year, the Secretary's estimate, as of July 1 of the fiscal year, of the aggregate reduction in expenditures under this subchapter during the preceding fiscal year directly resulting from the reduction in payment amounts under sections 1395w&ndash;4(a)(7), 1395w&ndash;23(<em>l</em>)(4), 1395w&ndash;23(m)(4), and 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(ix) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Payment from Trust Funds</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Funding limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts in the Fund shall be available in advance of appropriations but only if the total amount obligated from the Fund does not exceed the amount available to the Fund under paragraph (1). The Secretary may obligate funds from the Fund only if the Secretary determines (and the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the appropriate budget officer certify) that there are available in the Fund sufficient amounts to cover all such obligations incurred consistent with the previous sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No effect on payments in subsequent years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case that expenditures from the Fund are applied to, or otherwise affect, a payment rate for an item or service under this subchapter for a year, the payment rate for such item or service shall be computed for a subsequent year as if such application or effect had never occurred.</p>
