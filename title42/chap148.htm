<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Hurricanes, tropical storms, tornadoes, and thunderstorms can cause significant loss of life, injury, destruction of property, and economic and social disruption. All States and regions are vulnerable to these hazards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The United States currently sustains several billion dollars in economic damages each year due to these windstorms. In recent decades, rapid development and population growth in high-risk areas has greatly increased overall vulnerability to windstorms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Improved windstorm impact reduction measures have the potential to reduce these losses through&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) cost-effective and affordable design and construction methods and practices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) effective mitigation programs at the local, State, and national level;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) improved data collection and analysis and impact prediction methodologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) engineering research on improving new structures and retrofitting existing ones to better withstand windstorms, atmospheric-related research to better understand the behavior and impact of windstorms on the built environment, and subsequent application of those research results; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) public education and outreach.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) There is an appropriate role for the Federal Government in supporting windstorm impact reduction. An effective Federal program in windstorm impact reduction will require interagency coordination, and input from individuals, academia, the private sector, and other interested non-Federal entities.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The objective of the Program is the achievement of major measurable reductions in losses of life and property from windstorms. The objective is to be achieved through a coordinated Federal effort, in cooperation with other levels of government, academia, and the private sector, aimed at improving the understanding of windstorms and their impacts and developing and encouraging implementation of cost-effective mitigation measures to reduce those impacts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interagency Working Group</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 90 days after October 25, 2004, the Director shall establish an Interagency Working Group consisting of representatives of the National Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and other Federal agencies as appropriate. The Director shall designate an agency to serve as Chair of the Working Group and be responsible for the planning, management, and coordination of the Program, including budget coordination. Specific agency roles and responsibilities under the Program shall be defined in the implementation plan required under subsection (e). General agency responsibilities shall include the following:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Understanding of windstorms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Activities to enhance the understanding of windstorms shall include research to improve knowledge of and data collection on the impact of severe wind on buildings, structures, and infrastructure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Windstorm impact assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Activities to improve windstorm impact assessment shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) development of mechanisms for collecting and inventorying information on the performance of buildings, structures, and infrastructure in windstorms and improved collection of pertinent information from sources, including the design and construction industry, insurance companies, and building officials;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) research, development, and technology transfer to improve loss estimation and risk assessment systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) research, development, and technology transfer to improve simulation and computational modeling of windstorm impacts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Windstorm impact reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Activities to reduce windstorm impacts shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) development of improved outreach and implementation mechanisms to translate existing information and research findings into cost-effective and affordable practices for design and construction professionals, and State and local officials;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) development of cost-effective and affordable windstorm-resistant systems, structures, and materials for use in new construction and retrofit of existing construction; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) outreach and information dissemination related to cost-effective and affordable construction techniques, loss estimation and risk assessment methodologies, and other pertinent information regarding windstorm phenomena to Federal, State, and local officials, the construction industry, and the general public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Implementation plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after October 25, 2004, the Interagency Working Group shall develop and transmit to the Congress an implementation plan for achieving the objectives of the Program. The plan shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an assessment of past and current public and private efforts to reduce windstorm impacts, including a comprehensive review and analysis of windstorm mitigation activities supported by the Federal Government;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:7250 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a description of plans for technology transfer and coordination with natural hazard mitigation activities supported by the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a statement of strategic goals and priorities for each Program component area;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) a description of how the Program will achieve such goals, including detailed responsibilities for each agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a description of plans for cooperation and coordination with interested public and private sector entities in each program component area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Biennial report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Interagency Working Group shall, on a biennial basis, and not later than 180 days after the end of the preceding 2 fiscal years, transmit a report to the Congress describing the status of the windstorm impact reduction program, including progress achieved during the preceding two fiscal years. Each such report shall include any recommendations for legislative and other action the Interagency Working Group considers necessary and appropriate. In developing the biennial report, the Interagency Working Group shall consider the recommendations of the Advisory Committee established under section 15704 of this title.</p>
