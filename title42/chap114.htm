<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) individuals with mental illness are subject to neglect, including lack of treatment, adequate nutrition, clothing, health care, and adequate discharge planning; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) State systems for monitoring compliance with respect to the rights of individuals with mental illness vary widely and are frequently inadequate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purposes of this chapter are&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An eligible system may use its allotment under this subchapter to enter into contracts with State agencies and nonprofit organizations which operate throughout the State. In order to be eligible for a contract under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such an agency shall be independent of any agency which provides treatment or services (other than advocacy services) to individuals with mental illness; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such an agency or organization shall have the capacity to protect and advocate the rights of individuals with mental illness.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In carrying out paragraph (1), an eligible system should consider entering into contracts with organizations including, in particular, groups run by individuals who have received or are receiving mental health services, or the family members of such individuals, which,<sup><a href="#10804_1_target" name="10804_1">1</a></sup> provide protection or advocacy services to individuals with mental illness.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Obligation of allotments; technical assistance and training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an eligible system is a public entity, the government of the State in which the system is located may not require the system to obligate more than 5 percent of its allotment under this subchapter in any fiscal year for administrative expenses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An eligible system may not use more than 10 percent of any allotment under this subchapter for any fiscal year for the costs of providing technical assistance and training to carry out this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Representation of individuals with mental illness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An eligible system may use its allotment under this subchapter to provide representation to individuals with mental illness in Federal facilities who request representation by the eligible system. Representatives of such individuals from such system shall be accorded all the rights and authority accorded to other representatives of residents of such facilities pursuant to State law and other Federal laws.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Definition for purposes of representation of individuals with mental illness; priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The definition of &ldquo;individual with a mental illness&rdquo; contained in section 10802(4)(B)(iii) of this title shall apply, and thus an eligible system may use its allotment under this subchapter to provide representation to such individuals, only if the total allotment under this subchapter for any fiscal year is $30,000,000 or more, and in such case, an eligible system must give priority to representing persons with mental illness as defined in subparagraphs (A) and (B)(i) of section 10802(4) of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (2) and subject to the availability of appropriations under section 10827 of this title, the Secretary shall make allotments under section 10803 of this title from amounts appropriated under section 10827 of this title for a fiscal year to eligible systems on the basis of a formula prescribed by the Secretary which is based equally&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on the population of each State in which there is an eligible system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) on the population of each such State weighted by its relative per capita income.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A)(ii), the term &ldquo;relative per capita income&rdquo; means the quotient of the per capita income of the United States and the per capita income of the State, except that if the State is Guam, American Samoa, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Republic of Palau, or the Virgin Islands, the quotient shall be considered to be one.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The minimum amount of the allotment of an eligible system shall be the product (rounded to the nearest $100) of the appropriate base amount determined under subparagraph (B) and the factor specified in subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), the appropriate base amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for American Samoa, Guam, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, the Republic of Palau, and the Virgin Islands, is $139,300; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for any other State, is $260,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The factor specified in this subparagraph is the ratio of the amount appropriated under section 10827 of this title for the fiscal year for which the allotment is being made to the amount appropriated under such section for fiscal year 1995.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the total amount appropriated for a fiscal year is at least $25,000,000, the Secretary shall make an allotment in accordance with subparagraph (A) to the eligible system serving the American Indian consortium.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) To the extent that all the amounts appropriated under section 10827 of this title for a fiscal year are not allotted to eligible systems because&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) one or more eligible systems have not submitted an application for an allotment for such fiscal year; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) one or more eligible systems have notified the Secretary that they do not intend to use the full amount of their allotment,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the amount which is not so allotted shall be reallotted among the remaining eligible systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of an allotment to an eligible system for a fiscal year which the Secretary determines will not be required by the system during the period for which it is available shall be available for reallotment by the Secretary to other eligible systems with respect to which such a determination has not been made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary shall make reallotments under paragraphs (1) and (2) on such date or dates as the Secretary may fix (but not earlier than 30 days after the Secretary has published notice of the intention of the Secretary to make such reallotment in the Federal Register). A reallotment to an eligible system shall be made in proportion to the original allotment of such system for such fiscal year, but with such proportionate amount for such system being reduced to the extent it exceeds the sum the Secretary estimates such system needs and will be able to use during such period. The total of such reductions shall be similarly reallotted among eligible systems whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced. Any amount so reallotted to an eligible system for a fiscal year shall be deemed to be a part of its allotment under subsection (a) of this section for such fiscal year.</p>

An order denying such access should include the reasons for such denial.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Notwithstanding subparagraphs (A) and (B), in the case of a person admitted to a program or facility for the purpose of receiving mental health services, no individual employed by or receiving any remuneration from such program or facility should act as such person's guardian or representative.</p>
