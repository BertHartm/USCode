<!-- field-end:head -->

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each owner or operator of a facility required to file an annual toxic chemical release form under section 11023 of this title for any toxic chemical shall include with each such annual filing a toxic chemical source reduction and recycling report for the preceeding&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13106_1_target" name="13106_1">1</a></sup> calendar year. The toxic chemical source reduction and recycling report shall cover each toxic chemical required to be reported in the annual toxic chemical release form filed by the owner or operator under section 11023(c) of this title. This section shall take effect with the annual report filed under section 11023 of this title for the first full calendar year beginning after November 5, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Items included in report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The toxic chemical source reduction and recycling report required under subsection (a) of this section shall set forth each of the following on a facility-by-facility basis for each toxic chemical:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The quantity of the chemical entering any waste stream (or otherwise released into the environment) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal during the calendar year for which the report is filed and the percentage change from the previous year. The quantity reported shall not include any amount reported under paragraph (7). When actual measurements of the quantity of a toxic chemical entering the waste streams are not readily available, reasonable estimates should be made based on best engineering judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount of the chemical from the facility which is recycled (at the facility or elsewhere) during such calendar year, the percentage change from the previous year, and the process of recycling used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The source reduction practices used with respect to that chemical during such year at the facility. Such practices shall be reported in accordance with the following categories unless the Administrator finds other categories to be more appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Equipment, technology, process, or procedure modifications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Reformulation or redesign of products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Substitution of raw materials.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Improvement in management, training, inventory control, materials handling, or other general operational phases of industrial facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The amount expected to be reported under paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13106_2_target" name="13106_2">2</a></sup> (1) and (2) for the two calendar years immediately following the calendar year for which the report is filed. Such amount shall be expressed as a percentage change from the amount reported in paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A ratio of production in the reporting year to production in the previous year. The ratio should be calculated to most closely reflect all activities involving the toxic chemical. In specific industrial classifications subject to this section, where a feedstock or some variable other than production is the primary influence on waste characteristics or volumes, the report may provide an index based on that primary variable for each toxic chemical. The Administrator is encouraged to develop production indexes to accommodate individual industries for use on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The techniques which were used to identify source reduction opportunities. Techniques listed should include, but are not limited to, employee recommendations, external and internal audits, participative team management, and material balance audits. Each type of source reduction listed under paragraph (3) should be associated with the techniques or multiples of techniques used to identify the source reduction technique.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The amount of any toxic chemical released into the environment which resulted from a catastrophic event, remedial action, or other one-time event, and is not associated with production processes during the reporting year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The amount of the chemical from the facility which is treated (at the facility or elsewhere) during such calendar year and the percentage change from the previous year. For the first year of reporting under this subsection, comparison with the previous year is required only to the extent such information is available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) SARA provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of sections 11042, 11045(c), and 11046 of this title shall apply to the reporting requirements of this section in the same manner as to the reports required under section 11023 of this title. The Administrator may modify the form required for purposes of reporting information under section 11023 of this title to the extent he deems necessary to include the additional information required under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional optional information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person filing a report under this section for any year may include with the report additional information regarding source reduction, recycling, and other pollution control techniques in earlier years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability of data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 11042 of this title, the Administrator shall make data collected under this section publicly available in the same manner as the data collected under section 11023 of this title.</p>
