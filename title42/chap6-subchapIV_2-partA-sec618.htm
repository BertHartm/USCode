<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (C), the amount of a grant awarded to a State for a fiscal year under this paragraph shall be based on the formula used for determining the amount of Federal payments to the State under section 603(n) of this title (as such section was in effect before October 1, 1995).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Matching requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall pay to each eligible State in a fiscal year an amount, under a grant under subparagraph (A), equal to the Federal medical assistance percentage for such State for fiscal year 1995 (as defined in section 1396d(b) of this title) of so much of the expenditures by the State for child care in such year as exceed the State set-aside for such State under paragraph (1)(A) for such year and the amount of State expenditures in fiscal year 1994 or 1995 (whichever is greater) that equal the non-Federal share for the programs described in subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1).</p>

Such available amounts shall be redistributed to a State pursuant to section 603(n) of this title (as such section was in effect before October 1, 1995) by substituting &ldquo;the number of children residing in all States applying for such funds&rdquo; for &ldquo;the number of children residing in the United States in the second preceding fiscal year&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Time of determination and distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The determination of the Secretary under clause (i) for a fiscal year shall be made not later than the end of the first quarter of the subsequent fiscal year. The redistribution of amounts under clause (i) shall be made as close as practicable to the date on which such determination is made. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with this subparagraph shall, for purposes of this part, be regarded as part of such State's payment (as determined under this subsection) for the fiscal year in which the redistribution is made.</p>
