<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, an increase in the benefit amount payable under subchapter II of this chapter (over the amount payable in the preceding month, or, at the election of the Commissioner of Social Security, the second preceding month) to an individual receiving benefits under this subchapter shall be included in the income used to determine the benefit under this subchapter of such individual for any month which is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6) The dollar amount in effect under subsection (b) of this section as a result of any increase in benefits under this subchapter by reason of section 1382f of this title shall be used to determine the value of any in-kind support and maintenance required to be taken into account in determining the benefit payable under this subchapter to an individual (and the eligible spouse, if any, of the individual) for the 1st 2 months for which the increase in benefits applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, an application of an individual for benefits under this subchapter shall be effective on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the first day of the month following the date such application is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the first day of the month following the date such individual becomes eligible for such benefits with respect to such application.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Commissioner of Social Security may waive the limitations specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (e)(1) of this section on an individual's eligibility and benefit amount for a month (to the extent either such limitation is applicable by reason of such individual's presence throughout such month in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility) if such waiver would promote the individual's removal from such institution or facility. Upon waiver of such limitations, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply, to the month preceding the month of removal, or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, the two months preceding the month of removal, the benefit rate that is appropriate to such individual's living arrangement subsequent to his removal from such institution or facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(9)(A) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), any nonrecurring income which is paid to an individual in the first month of any period of eligibility shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under this subchapter of such individual (and his eligible spouse, if any) only for that month, and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit for any other month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of subparagraph (A), payments to an individual in varying amounts from the same or similar source for the same or similar purpose shall not be considered to be nonrecurring income.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(10) For purposes of this subsection, remuneration for service performed as a member of a uniformed service may be treated as received in the month in which it was earned, if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that such treatment would promote the economical and efficient administration of the program authorized by this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on amount of gross income earned; &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe the circumstances under which, consistently with the purposes of this subchapter, the gross income from a trade or business (including farming) will be considered sufficiently large to make an individual ineligible for benefits under this subchapter. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; has the same meaning as when used in chapter 1 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on eligibility of certain individuals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraphs (B), (C), (D), (E), and (G), no person shall be an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter with respect to any month if throughout such month he is an inmate of a public institution.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Commissioner of Social Security finds that any part of the amount excluded under paragraph (1) was used for purposes other than those for which it was set aside in cases where the inclusion of any portion of the amount would cause the resources of such individual, or of such individual and spouse, to exceed the limits specified in paragraph (1) or (2) (whichever may be applicable) of section 1382(a) of this title, the Commissioner shall reduce any future benefits payable to the eligible individual (or to such individual and his spouse) by an amount equal to such part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of an irrevocable trust to which are transferred the assets of an individual (or of the individual's spouse) and the assets of any other person, this subsection shall apply to the portion of the trust attributable to the assets of the individual (or of the individual's spouse).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of an irrevocable trust established by an individual, if there are any circumstances under which payment from the trust could be made to or for the benefit of the individual (or of the individual's spouse), the portion of the corpus from which payment to or for the benefit of the individual (or of the individual's spouse) could be made shall be considered a resource available to the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Commissioner of Social Security may waive the application of this subsection with respect to an individual if the Commissioner determines that such application would work an undue hardship (as determined on the basis of criteria established by the Commissioner) on the individual.</p>

In determining whether an individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity by reason of his earnings, where his disability is sufficiently severe to result in a functional limitation requiring assistance in order for him to work, there shall be excluded from such earnings an amount equal to the cost (to such individual) of any attendant care services, medical devices, equipment, prostheses, and similar items and services (not including routine drugs or routine medical services unless such drugs or services are necessary for the control of the disabling condition) which are necessary (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security in regulations) for that purpose, whether or not such assistance is also needed to enable him to carry out his normal daily functions; except that the amounts to be excluded shall be subject to such reasonable limits as the Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe. Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (B), an individual whose services or earnings meet such criteria shall be found not to be disabled. The Commissioner of Social Security shall make determinations under this subchapter with respect to substantial gainful activity, without regard to the legality of the activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraphs (A) through (E), an individual shall also be considered to be disabled for purposes of this subchapter if he is permanently and totally disabled as defined under a State plan approved under subchapter XIV or XVI of this chapter as in effect for October 1972 and received aid under such plan (on the basis of disability) for December 1973 (and for at least one month prior to July 1973), so long as he is continuously disabled as so defined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) In determining whether an individual's physical or mental impairment or impairments are of a sufficient medical severity that such impairment or impairments could be the basis of eligibility under this section, the Commissioner of Social Security shall consider the combined effect of all of the individual's impairments without regard to whether any such impairment, if considered separately, would be of such severity. If the Commissioner of Social Security does find a medically severe combination of impairments, the combined impact of the impairments shall be considered throughout the disability determination process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(H)(i) In making determinations with respect to disability under this subchapter, the provisions of sections 421(h), 421(k), and 423(d)(5) of this title shall apply in the same manner as they apply to determinations of disability under subchapter II of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) Not less frequently than once every 3 years, the Commissioner shall review in accordance with paragraph (4) the continued eligibility for benefits under this subchapter of each individual who has not attained 18 years of age and is eligible for such benefits by reason of an impairment (or combination of impairments) which is likely to improve (or, at the option of the Commissioner, which is unlikely to improve).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) A representative payee of a recipient whose case is reviewed under this clause shall present, at the time of review, evidence demonstrating that the recipient is, and has been, receiving treatment, to the extent considered medically necessary and available, of the condition which was the basis for providing benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2300 --><p class="statutory-body">(III) If the representative payee refuses to comply without good cause with the requirements of subclause (II), the Commissioner of Social Security shall, if the Commissioner determines it is in the best interest of the individual, promptly suspend payment of benefits to the representative payee, and provide for payment of benefits to an alternative representative payee of the individual or, if the interest of the individual under this subchapter would be served thereby, to the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) Subclause (II) shall not apply to the representative payee of any individual with respect to whom the Commissioner determines such application would be inappropriate or unnecessary. In making such determination, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the nature of the individual's impairment (or combination of impairments). Section 1383(c) of this title shall not apply to a finding by the Commissioner that the requirements of subclause (II) should not apply to an individual's representative payee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If an individual is eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability for the month preceding the month in which the individual attains the age of 18 years, the Commissioner shall redetermine such eligibility&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) by applying the criteria used in determining initial eligibility for individuals who are age 18 or older; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) either during the 1-year period beginning on the individual's 18th birthday or, in lieu of a continuing disability review, whenever the Commissioner determines that an individual's case is subject to a redetermination under this clause.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">With respect to any redetermination under this clause, paragraph (4) shall not apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv)(I) Except as provided in subclause (VI), not later than 12 months after the birth of an individual, the Commissioner shall review in accordance with paragraph (4) the continuing eligibility for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability of such individual whose low birth weight is a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) A review under subclause (I) shall be considered a substitute for a review otherwise required under any other provision of this subparagraph during that 12-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) A representative payee of a recipient whose case is reviewed under this clause shall present, at the time of review, evidence demonstrating that the recipient is, and has been, receiving treatment, to the extent considered medically necessary and available, of the condition which was the basis for providing benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(IV) If the representative payee refuses to comply without good cause with the requirements of subclause (III), the Commissioner of Social Security shall, if the Commissioner determines it is in the best interest of the individual, promptly suspend payment of benefits to the representative payee, and provide for payment of benefits to an alternative representative payee of the individual or, if the interest of the individual under this subchapter would be served thereby, to the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(V) Subclause (III) shall not apply to the representative payee of any individual with respect to whom the Commissioner determines such application would be inappropriate or unnecessary. In making such determination, the Commissioner shall take into consideration the nature of the individual's impairment (or combination of impairments). Section 1383(c) of this title shall not apply to a finding by the Commissioner that the requirements of subclause (III) should not apply to an individual's representative payee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(VI) Subclause (I) shall not apply in the case of an individual described in that subclause who, at the time of the individual's initial disability determination, the Commissioner determines has an impairment that is not expected to improve within 12 months after the birth of that individual, and who the Commissioner schedules for a continuing disability review at a date that is after the individual attains 1 year of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(I) In making any determination under this subchapter with respect to the disability of an individual who has not attained the age of 18 years and to whom section 421(h) of this title does not apply, the Commissioner of Social Security shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that a qualified pediatrician or other individual who specializes in a field of medicine appropriate to the disability of the individual (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security) evaluates the case of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(J) Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), an individual shall not be considered to be disabled for purposes of this subchapter if alcoholism or drug addiction would (but for this subparagraph) be a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A recipient of benefits based on disability under this subchapter may be determined not to be entitled to such benefits on the basis of a finding that the physical or mental impairment on the basis of which such benefits are provided has ceased, does not exist, or is not disabling only if such finding is supported by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of an individual who is age 18 or older&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) substantial evidence which demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) there has been any medical improvement in the individual's impairment or combination of impairments (other than medical improvement which is not related to the individual's ability to work), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) substantial evidence (except in the case of an individual eligible to receive benefits under section 1382h of this title) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) consists of new medical evidence and a new assessment of the individual's residual functional capacity, and demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) although the individual has not improved medically, he or she is nonetheless a beneficiary of advances in medical or vocational therapy or technology (related to the individual's ability to work), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity, or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:2301 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) demonstrates that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(aa) although the individual has not improved medically, he or she has undergone vocational therapy (related to the individual's ability to work), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(bb) the individual is now able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) substantial evidence which demonstrates that, as determined on the basis of new or improved diagnostic techniques or evaluations, the individual's impairment or combination of impairments is not as disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent prior decision that he or she was under a disability or continued to be under a disability, and that therefore the individual is able to engage in substantial gainful activity; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of an individual who is under the age of 18&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) substantial evidence which demonstrates that there has been medical improvement in the individual's impairment or combination of impairments, and that such impairment or combination of impairments no longer results in marked and severe functional limitations; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) substantial evidence which demonstrates that, as determined on the basis of new or improved diagnostic techniques or evaluations, the individual's impairment or combination of impairments, is not as disabling as it was considered to be at the time of the most recent prior decision that the individual was under a disability or continued to be under a disability, and such impairment or combination of impairments does not result in marked and severe functional limitations; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in the case of any individual, substantial evidence (which may be evidence on the record at the time any prior determination of the entitlement to benefits based on disability was made, or newly obtained evidence which relates to that determination) which demonstrates that a prior determination was in error.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to require a determination that an individual receiving benefits based on disability under this subchapter is entitled to such benefits if the prior determination was fraudulently obtained or if the individual is engaged in substantial gainful activity, cannot be located, or fails, without good cause, to cooperate in a review of his or her entitlement or to follow prescribed treatment which would be expected (i) to restore his or her ability to engage in substantial gainful activity, or (ii) in the case of an individual under the age of 18, to eliminate or improve the individual's impairment or combination of impairments so that it no longer results in marked and severe functional limitations. Any determination under this paragraph shall be made on the basis of all the evidence available in the individual's case file, including new evidence concerning the individual's prior or current condition which is presented by the individual or secured by the Commissioner of Social Security. Any determination made under this paragraph shall be made on the basis of the weight of the evidence and on a neutral basis with regard to the individual's condition, without any initial inference as to the presence or absence of disability being drawn from the fact that the individual has previously been determined to be disabled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;eligible spouse&rdquo; means an aged, blind, or disabled individual who is the husband or wife of another aged, blind, or disabled individual, and who, in a month, is living with such aged, blind, or disabled individual on the first day of the month or, in any case in which either spouse files an application for benefits, on the first day of the month following the date the application is filed, or, in any case in which either spouse requests restoration of eligibility under this subchapter during the month, at the time the request is filed. If two aged, blind, or disabled individuals are husband and wife as described in the preceding sentence, only one of them may be an &ldquo;eligible individual&rdquo; within the meaning of section 1382(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; means an individual who is neither married nor (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security) the head of a household, and who is (1) under the age of eighteen, or (2) under the age of twenty-two and (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security) a student regularly attending a school, college, or university, or a course of vocational or technical training designed to prepare him for gainful employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In determining whether two individuals are husband and wife for purposes of this subchapter, appropriate State law shall be applied; except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if a man and woman have been determined to be husband and wife under section 416(h)(1) of this title for purposes of subchapter II of this chapter they shall be considered (from and after the date of such determination or the date of their application for benefits under this subchapter, whichever is later) to be husband and wife for purposes of this subchapter, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) if a man and woman are found to be holding themselves out to the community in which they reside as husband and wife, they shall be so considered for purposes of this subchapter notwithstanding any other provision of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;United States&rdquo;, when used in a geographical sense, means the 50 States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits for any individual who is married and whose spouse is living with him in the same household but is not an eligible spouse, such individual's income and resources shall be deemed to include any income and resources of such spouse, whether or not available to such individual, except to the extent determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be inequitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits for any individ<!-- PDFPage:2302 -->ual who is a child under age 18, such individual's income and resources shall be deemed to include any income and resources of a parent of such individual (or the spouse of such a parent) who is living in the same household as such individual, whether or not available to such individual, except to the extent determined by the Commissioner of Social Security to be inequitable under the circumstances.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of any child who has not attained the age of 18 years who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is disabled;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) received benefits under this subchapter, pursuant to section 1382(e)(1)(B) of this title, while in an institution described in section 1382(e)(1)(B) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is eligible for medical assistance under a State home care plan approved by the Secretary under the provisions of section 1396n(c) of this title relating to waivers, or authorized under section 1396a(e)(3) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) but for this subparagraph, would not be eligible for benefits under this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits for any individual who is an alien, such individual's income and resources shall be deemed to include the income and resources of his sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such alien has a sponsor) as provided in section 1382j of this title. Any such income deemed to be income of such individual shall be treated as unearned income of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), a spouse or parent (or spouse of such a parent) who is absent from the household in which the individual lives due solely to a duty assignment as a member of the Armed Forces on active duty shall, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, be deemed to be living in the same household as the individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after the calendar quarter in which it first makes such supplementary payments,</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Levels of supplementary payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commissioner of Social Security shall not find that a State has failed to meet the requirements imposed by paragraph (4) of subsection (a) of this section with respect to the levels of its supplementary payments for a particular month or months if the State's expenditures for such payments in the twelve-month period (within which such month or months fall) beginning on the effective date of any increase in the level of supplemental security income benefits pursuant to section 1382f of this title are not less than its expenditures for such payments in the preceding twelve-month period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of determining under paragraph (1) whether a State's expenditures for supplementary payments in the 12-month period beginning on the effective date of any increase in the level of supplemental security income benefits are not less than the State's expenditures for such payments in the preceding 12-month period, the Commissioner of Social Security, in computing the State's expenditures, shall disregard, pursuant to a 1-time election of the State, all expenditures by the State for retroactive supplementary payments that are required to be made in connection with the retroactive supplemental security income benefits referred to in section 5041 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commissioner of Social Security shall make a determination under paragraph (1)(A) with respect to an individual not later than 12 months after the first month for which the individual qualifies for a benefit under this subsection.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization of appropriations for pilot program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to establish and carry out a 3-year Federal-State pilot program to provide medical and social services for certain handicapped individuals in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) State allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The total sum of $18,000,000 shall be allotted to the States for such program by the Commissioner of Social Security, during the period beginning September 1, 1981, and ending September 30, 1984, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The total sum of $6,000,000 shall be allotted to the States for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1982 (which for purposes of this section shall include the month of September 1981).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The total sum of $6,000,000, plus any amount remaining available (after the application of paragraph (4)) from the allotment made under subparagraph (A), shall be allotted to the States for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The total sum of $6,000,000, plus any amount remaining available (after the application of paragraph (4)) from the allotments made under subparagraphs (A) and (B), shall be allotted to the States for the fiscal year ending September 30, 1984.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The allotment to each State from the total sum allotted under paragraph (1) for any fiscal year shall bear the same ratio to such total sum as the number of individuals in such State who are over age 17 and under age 65 and are receiving supplemental security income benefits as disabled individuals in such year (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security on the basis of the most recent data available) bears to the total number of such individuals in all the States. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term &ldquo;supplemental security income benefits&rdquo; includes payments made pursuant to an agreement under section 1382e(a) of this title or under section 212(b) of Public Law 93&ndash;66.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) At the beginning of each fiscal year in which the pilot program under this section is in effect, each State that does not intend to use the allotment to which it is entitled for such year (or any allotment which was made to it for a prior fiscal year), or that does not intend to <!-- PDFPage:2319 -->use the full amount of any such allotment, shall certify to the Commissioner of Social Security the amount of such allotment which it does not intend to use, and the State's allotment for the fiscal year (or years) involved shall thereupon be reduced by the amount so certified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The portion of the total amount available for allotment for any particular fiscal year under paragraph (1) which is not allotted to States for that year by reason of paragraph (3) (plus the amount of any reductions made at the beginning of such year in the allotments of States for prior fiscal years under paragraph (3)) shall be reallocated in such manner as the Commissioner of Social Security may determine to be appropriate to States which need, and will use, additional assistance in providing services to severely handicapped individuals in that particular year under their approved plans. Any amount reallocated to a State under this paragraph for use in a particular fiscal year shall be treated for purposes of this section as increasing such State's allotment for that year by an equivalent amount.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requisite features of State plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to participate in the pilot program and be eligible to receive payments for any period under subsection (d) of this section, a State (during such period) must have a plan, approved by the Commissioner of Social Security as meeting the requirements of this section, which provides medical and social services for severely handicapped individuals whose earnings are above the level which ordinarily demonstrates an ability to engage in substantial gainful activity and who are not receiving benefits under section 1382 or 1382h of this title or assistance under a State plan approved under section 1396a of this title, and which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) declares the intent of the State to participate in the pilot program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) designates an appropriate State agency to administer or supervise the administration of the program in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) describes the criteria to be applied by the State in determining the eligibility of any individual for assistance under the plan and in any event requires a determination by the State agency to the effect that (A) such individual's ability to continue his employment would be significantly inhibited without such assistance and (B) such individual's earnings are not sufficient to allow him to provide for himself a reasonable equivalent of the cash and other benefits that would be available to him under this subchapter and subchapters XIX and XX of this chapter in the absence of those earnings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) describes the process by which the eligibility of individuals for such assistance is to be determined (and such process may not involve the performance of functions by any State agency or entity which is engaged in making determinations of disability for purposes of disability insurance or supplemental security income benefits except when the use of a different agency or entity to perform those functions would not be feasible);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) describes the medical and social services to be provided under the plan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) describes the manner in which the medical and social services involved are to be provided and, if they are not to be provided through the State's medical assistance and social services programs under subchapters XIX and XX of this chapter (with the Federal payments being made under subsection (d) of this section rather than under those subchapters), specifies the particular mechanisms and procedures to be used in providing such services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) contains such other provisions as the Commissioner of Social Security may find to be necessary or appropriate to meet the requirements of this section or otherwise carry out its purpose.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payments to States; computation of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From its allotment under subsection (b) of this section for any fiscal year (and any amounts remaining available from allotments made to it for prior fiscal years), the Commissioner of Social Security shall from time to time pay to each State which has a plan approved under subsection (c) of this section an amount equal to 75 per centum of the total sum expended under such plan (including the cost of administration of such plan) in providing medical and social services to severely handicapped individuals who are eligible for such services under the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The method of computing and making payments under this section shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Commissioner of Social Security shall, prior to each period for which a payment is to be made to a State, estimate the amount to be paid to the State for such period under the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) From the allotment available therefor, the Commissioner of Social Security shall pay the amount so estimated, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (not previously adjusted under this subsection) by which the Commissioner finds that the Commissioner's estimate of the amount to be paid the State for any prior period under this section was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such period under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within nine months after June 9, 1980, the Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe and publish such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out the pilot program and otherwise implement this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State participating in the pilot program under this section shall from time to time report to the Commissioner of Social Security on the operation and results of such program in that State, with particular emphasis upon the work incentive effects of the program. On or before October 1, 1983, the Commissioner of Social Security shall submit to the Congress a report on the program, incorporating the information contained in the State reports along with the Commissioner's findings and recommendations.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Attribution as unearned income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits under this subchapter for an individual who is an alien, the income and resources of any person who (as a sponsor of such individual's entry into the United States) executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement with respect to such individual, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse, shall be deemed to be the income and resources of such individual (in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this section) for a period of 3 years after the individual's entry into the United States. Any such income deemed to be income of such individual shall be treated as unearned income of such individual.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of amount and resources</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of income of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the unearned income of an alien for any year shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The total yearly rate of earned and unearned income (as determined under section 1382a(a) of this title) of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined for such year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by an amount equal to (i) the maximum amount of the Federal benefit under this subchapter for such year which would be payable to an eligible individual who has no other income and who does not have an eligible spouse (as determined under section 1382(b)(1) of this title), plus (ii) one-half of the amount determined under clause (i) multiplied by the number of individuals who are dependents of such sponsor (or such sponsor's spouse if such spouse is living with the sponsor), other than such alien and such alien's spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The amount of income which shall be deemed to be unearned income of such alien shall be at a yearly rate equal to the amount determined under subparagraph (B). The period for determination of such amount shall be the same as the period for determination of benefits under section 1382(c) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of resources of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the resources of an alien for any year shall be determined as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by an amount equal to (i) the applicable amount determined under section 1382(a)(3)(B) of this title in the case of a sponsor who has no spouse with whom he is living, or (ii) the applicable amount determined under section 1382(a)(3)(A) of this title in the case of a sponsor who has a spouse with whom he is living.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The resources of such sponsor (and spouse) as determined under subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be deemed to be resources of such alien in addition to any resources of such alien.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Support and maintenance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In determining the amount of income of an alien during the period of 3 years after such alien's entry into the United States, the reduction in dollar amounts otherwise required under section 1382a(a)(2)(A)(i) of this title shall not be applicable if such alien is living in the household of a person who is a sponsor (or such sponsor's spouse) of such alien, and is receiving support and maintenance in kind from such sponsor (or spouse), nor shall support or maintenance furnished in cash or kind to an alien by such alien's sponsor (to the extent that it reflects income or resources which were taken into account in determining the amount of income and resources to be deemed to the alien under subsection (a) or (b) of this section) be considered to be income of such alien under section 1382a(a)(2)(A) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Information and documentation; agreements with Secretary of State and Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any individual who is an alien shall, during the period of 3 years after entry into the United States, in order to be an eligible individual or eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter, be required to provide to the Commissioner of Social Security such information and documentation with respect to his sponsor as may be necessary in order for the Commissioner of Social Security to make any determination required under this section, and to obtain any cooperation from such sponsor necessary for any such determination. Such alien shall also be required to provide to the Commissioner of Social Security such information and documentation <!-- PDFPage:2321 -->as the Commissioner of Social Security may request and which such alien or his sponsor provided in support of such alien's immigration application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commissioner of Social Security shall enter into agreements with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General whereby any information available to such persons and required in order to make any determination under this section will be provided by such persons to the Commissioner of Social Security, and whereby such persons shall inform any sponsor of an alien, at the time such sponsor executes an affidavit of support or similar agreement, of the requirements imposed by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Joint and several liability of alien and sponsor for overpayments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any sponsor of an alien, and such alien, shall be jointly and severally liable for an amount equal to any overpayment made to such alien during the period of 3 years after such alien's entry into the United States, on account of such sponsor's failure to provide correct information under the provisions of this section, except where such sponsor was without fault, or where good cause for such failure existed. Any such overpayment which is not repaid to the Commissioner of Social Security or recovered in accordance with section 1383(b) of this title shall be withheld from any subsequent payment to which such alien or such sponsor is entitled under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exemptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of this section shall not apply with respect to any individual who is an &ldquo;aged, blind, or disabled individual&rdquo; for purposes of this subchapter by reason of blindness (as determined under section 1382c(a)(2) of this title) or disability (as determined under section 1382c(a)(3) of this title), from and after the onset of the impairment, if such blindness or disability commenced after the date of such individual's admission into the United States for permanent residence.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Time, manner, form, and duration of payments; representative payees; promulgation of regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Benefits under this subchapter shall be paid at such time or times and (subject to paragraph (10)) in such installments as will best effectuate the purposes of this subchapter, as determined under regulations (and may in any case be paid less frequently than monthly where the amount of the monthly benefit would not exceed $10).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) Payments of the benefit of any individual may be made to any such individual or to the eligible spouse (if any) of such individual or partly to each.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) Upon a determination by the Commissioner of Social Security that the interest of such individual would be served thereby, such payments shall be made, regardless of the legal competency or incompetency of the individual or eligible spouse, to another individual, or an organization, with respect to whom the requirements of subparagraph (B) have been met (in this paragraph referred to as such individual's &ldquo;representative payee&rdquo;) for the use and benefit of the individual or eligible spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) In the case of an individual eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability, the payment of such benefits shall be made to a representative payee if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that such payment would serve the interest of the individual because the individual also has an alcoholism or drug addiction condition (as determined by the Commissioner) and the individual is incapable of managing such benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Commissioner of Social Security or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the representative payee of an individual or eligible spouse has misused any benefits which have been paid to the representative payee pursuant to clause (ii) or section 405(j)(1) or 1007 of this title, the Commissioner of Social Security shall promptly terminate payment of benefits to the representative payee pursuant to this subparagraph, and provide for payment of benefits to an alternative representative payee of the individual or eligible spouse or, if the interest of the individual under this subchapter would be served thereby, to the individual or eligible spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) For purposes of this paragraph, misuse of benefits by a representative payee occurs in any case in which the representative payee receives payment under this subchapter for the use and benefit of another person and converts such payment, or any part thereof, to a use other than for the use and benefit of such other person. The Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe by regulation the meaning of the term &ldquo;use and benefit&rdquo; for purposes of this clause.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Any determination made under subparagraph (A) for payment of benefits to the representative payee of an individual or eligible spouse shall be made on the basis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) an investigation by the Commissioner of Social Security of the person to serve as representative payee, which shall be conducted in advance of such payment, and shall, to the extent practicable, include a face-to-face interview with such person; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) adequate evidence that such payment is in the interest of the individual or eligible spouse (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security in regulations).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) As part of the investigation referred to in clause (i)(I), the Commissioner of Social Security shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) require the person being investigated to submit documented proof of the identity of such person, unless information establishing such identity was submitted with an application for benefits under subchapter II of this chapter, subchapter VIII of this chapter, or this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) verify the social security account number (or employer identification number) of such person;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) determine whether such person has been convicted of a violation of section 408, 1011, or 1383a of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) obtain information concerning whether the person has been convicted of any other offense under Federal or State law which resulted in imprisonment for more than 1 year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) obtain information concerning whether such person is a person described in section 1382(e)(4)(A) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VI) determine whether payment of benefits to such person has been terminated pursuant to subparagraph (A)(iii), whether the designation of such person as a representative payee has been revoked pursuant to section 1007(a) of this title, and whether certification of payment of benefits to such person has been revoked pursuant to section 405(j) of this title, by reason of misuse of funds paid as benefits under subchapter II of this chapter, subchapter VIII of this chapter, or this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Benefits of an individual may not be paid to any other person pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) such person has previously been convicted as described in clause (ii)(III);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) except as provided in clause (iv), payment of benefits to such person pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) has previously been terminated as described in clause (ii)(VI), the designation of such person as a representative payee has been revoked pursuant to section 1007(a) of this title, or certification of payment of benefits to such person under section 405(j) of this title has previously been revoked as described in section 405(j)(2)(B)(i)(VI) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) except as provided in clause (v), such person is a creditor of such individual who provides such individual with goods or services for consideration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) the person has previously been convicted as described in clause (ii)(IV) of this subparagraph, unless the Commissioner determines that the payment would be appropriate notwithstanding the conviction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) such person is a person described in section 1382(e)(4)(A) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe regulations under which the Commis<!-- PDFPage:2323 -->sioner of Social Security may grant an exemption from clause (iii)(II) to any person on a case-by-case basis if such exemption would be in the best interest of the individual or eligible spouse whose benefits under this subchapter would be paid to such person pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) Clause (iii)(III) shall not apply with respect to any person who is a creditor referred to therein if such creditor is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a relative of such individual if such relative resides in the same household as such individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) a legal guardian or legal representative of such individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) a facility that is licensed or certified as a care facility under the law of a State or a political subdivision of a State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) a person who is an administrator, owner, or employee of a facility referred to in subclause (III) if such individual resides in such facility, and the payment of benefits under this subchapter to such facility or such person is made only after good faith efforts have been made by the local servicing office of the Social Security Administration to locate an alternative representative payee to whom the payment of such benefits would serve the best interests of such individual; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) an individual who is determined by the Commissioner of Social Security, on the basis of written findings and under procedures which the Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe by regulation, to be acceptable to serve as a representative payee.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) The procedures referred to in clause (v)(V) shall require the individual who will serve as representative payee to establish, to the satisfaction of the Commissioner of Social Security, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) such individual poses no risk to the beneficiary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the financial relationship of such individual to the beneficiary poses no substantial conflict of interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) no other more suitable representative payee can be found.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) In the case of an individual described in subparagraph (A)(ii)(II), when selecting such individual's representative payee, preference shall be given to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a certified community-based nonprofit social service agency (as defined in subparagraph (I));</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) a Federal, State, or local government agency whose mission is to carry out income maintenance, social service, or health care-related activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) a State or local government agency with fiduciary responsibilities; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) a designee of an agency (other than of a Federal agency) referred to in the preceding subclauses of this clause, if the Commissioner of Social Security deems it appropriate,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless the Commissioner of Social Security determines that selection of a family member would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) Subject to clause (ix), if the Commissioner of Social Security makes a determination described in subparagraph (A)(ii) with respect to any individual's benefit and determines that direct payment of the benefit to the individual would cause substantial harm to the individual, the Commissioner of Social Security may defer (in the case of initial entitlement) or suspend (in the case of existing entitlement) direct payment of such benefit to the individual, until such time as the selection of a representative payee is made pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ix)(I) Except as provided in subclause (II), any deferral or suspension of direct payment of a benefit pursuant to clause (viii) shall be for a period of not more than 1 month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) Subclause (I) shall not apply in any case in which the individual or eligible spouse is, as of the date of the Commissioner's determination, legally incompetent, under the age of 15 years, or described in subparagraph (A)(ii)(II).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(x) Payment pursuant to this subparagraph of any benefits which are deferred or suspended pending the selection of a representative payee shall be made to the individual, or to the representative payee upon such selection, as a single sum or over such period of time as the Commissioner of Social Security determines is in the best interests of the individual entitled to such benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(xi) Any individual who is dissatisfied with a determination by the Commissioner of Social Security to pay such individual's benefits to a representative payee under this subchapter, or with the designation of a particular person to serve as representative payee, shall be entitled to a hearing by the Commissioner of Social Security, and to judicial review of the Commissioner's final decision, to the same extent as is provided in subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(xii) In advance of the first payment of an individual's benefit to a representative payee under subparagraph (A)(ii), the Commissioner of Social Security shall provide written notice of the Commissioner's initial determination to make any such payment. Such notice shall be provided to such individual, except that, if such individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) is under the age of 15,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) is an unemancipated minor under the age of 18, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) is legally incompetent,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then such notice shall be provided solely to the legal guardian or legal representative of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(xiii) Any notice described in clause (xii) shall be clearly written in language that is easily understandable to the reader, shall identify the person to be designated as such individual's representative payee, and shall explain to the reader the right under clause (xi) of such individual or of such individual's legal guardian or legal representative&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) to review the evidence upon which such designation is based and submit additional evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(xiv) Notwithstanding the provisions of section 552a of title 5 or any other provision of Fed<!-- PDFPage:2324 -->eral or State law (other than section 6103 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and section 1306(c) of this title), the Commissioner shall furnish any Federal, State, or local law enforcement officer, upon the written request of the officer, with the current address, social security account number, and photograph (if applicable) of any person investigated under this subparagraph, if the officer furnishes the Commissioner with the name of such person and such other identifying information as may reasonably be required by the Commissioner to establish the unique identity of such person, and notifies the Commissioner that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) such person is described in section 1382(e)(4)(A) of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) such person has information that is necessary for the officer to conduct the officer's official duties, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the location or apprehension of such person is within the officer's official duties.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) In any case where payment is made under this subchapter to a representative payee of an individual or spouse, the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish a system of accountability monitoring whereby such person shall report not less often than annually with respect to the use of such payments. The Commissioner of Social Security shall establish and implement statistically valid procedures for reviewing such reports in order to identify instances in which such persons are not properly using such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Clause (i) shall not apply in any case where the representative payee is a State institution. In such cases, the Commissioner of Social Security shall establish a system of accountability monitoring for institutions in each State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Clause (i) shall not apply in any case where the individual entitled to such payment is a resident of a Federal institution and the representative payee is the institution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Notwithstanding clauses (i), (ii), and (iii), the Commissioner of Social Security may require a report at any time from any representative payee, if the Commissioner of Social Security has reason to believe that the representative payee is misusing such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) In any case in which the person described in clause (i) or (iv) receiving payments on behalf of another fails to submit a report required by the Commissioner of Social Security under clause (i) or (iv), the Commissioner may, after furnishing notice to the person and the individual entitled to the payment, require that such person appear in person at a field office of the Social Security Administration serving the area in which the individual resides in order to receive such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Except as provided in the next sentence, a qualified organization may collect from an individual a monthly fee for expenses (including overhead) incurred by such organization in providing services performed as such individual's representative payee pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) if the fee does not exceed the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) 10 percent of the monthly benefit involved, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) $25.00 per month ($50.00 per month in any case in which an individual is described in subparagraph (A)(ii)(II)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A qualified organization may not collect a fee from an individual for any month with respect to which the Commissioner of Social Security or a court of competent jurisdiction has determined that the organization misused all or part of the individual's benefit, and any amount so collected by the qualified organization for such month shall be treated as a misused part of the individual's benefit for purposes of subparagraphs (E) and (F). The Commissioner of Social Security shall adjust annually (after 1995) each dollar amount set forth in subclause (II) of this clause under procedures providing for adjustments in the same manner and to the same extent as adjustments are provided for under the procedures used to adjust benefit amounts under section 415(i)(2)(A) of this title, except that any amount so adjusted that is not a multiple of $1.00 shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of $1.00. Any agreement providing for a fee in excess of the amount permitted under this clause shall be void and shall be treated as misuse by the organization of such individual's benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;qualified organization&rdquo; means any State or local government agency whose mission is to carry out income maintenance, social service, or health care-related activities, any State or local government agency with fiduciary responsibilities, or any certified community-based nonprofit social service agency (as defined in subparagraph (I)), if the agency, in accordance with any applicable regulations of the Commissioner of Social Security&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) regularly provides services as a representative payee pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) or section 405(j)(4) or 1007 of this title concurrently to 5 or more individuals; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe regulations under which the Commissioner of Social Security may grant an exception from subclause (II) for any individual on a case-by-case basis if such exception is in the best interests of such individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In the case of an individual who is no longer eligible for benefits under this subchapter but to whom any amount of past-due benefits under this subchapter has not been paid, for purposes of clause (i), any amount of such past-due benefits payable in any month shall be treated as a monthly benefit referred to in clause (i)(I).</p>

The Commissioner of Social Security shall make a good faith effort to obtain restitution from the terminated representative payee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i)(I) Each representative payee of an eligible individual under the age of 18 who is eligible for the payment of benefits described in subclause (II) shall establish on behalf of such individual an account in a financial institution into which such benefits shall be paid, and shall thereafter maintain such account for use in accordance with clause (ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">provided that such expense benefits such individual and, in the case of an expense described in item (bb), (cc), (dd), (ff), or (gg), is related to the impairment (or combination of impairments) of such individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(III) The use of funds from an account established under clause (i) in any manner not authorized by this clause&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(aa) by a representative payee shall be considered a misapplication of benefits for all purposes of this paragraph, and any representative payee who knowingly misapplies benefits from such an account shall be liable to the Commissioner in an amount equal to the total amount of such benefits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(bb) by an eligible individual who is his or her own payee shall be considered a misapplication of benefits for all purposes of this paragraph and in any case in which the individual knowingly misapplies benefits from such an account, the Commissioner shall reduce future benefits payable to such individual (or to such individual and his spouse) by an amount equal to the total amount of such benefits so misapplied.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(G)(i) In addition to such other reviews of representative payees as the Commissioner of Social Security may otherwise conduct, the Commissioner shall provide for the periodic onsite review of any person or agency that receives the benefits payable under this subchapter (alone or in combination with benefits payable under subchapter II of this chapter or subchapter VIII of this chapter) to another individual pursuant to the appointment of the person or agency as a representative payee under this paragraph, section 405(j) of this title, or section 1007 of this title in any case in which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commissioner of Social Security (i) shall make such provision as the Commissioner finds appropriate in the case of payment of more than the correct amount of benefits with respect to an individual with a view to avoiding penalizing such individual or his eligible spouse who was without fault in connection with the overpayment, if adjustment or recovery on account of such overpayment in such case would defeat the purposes of this subchapter, or be against equity and good conscience, or (because of the small amount involved) impede efficient or effective administration of this subchapter, and (ii) shall in any event make the adjustment or recovery (in the case of payment of more than the correct amount of benefits), in the case of an individual or eligible spouse receiving monthly benefit payments under this subchapter (including supplementary payments of the type described in section 1382e(a) of this title and payments pursuant to an agreement entered into under section 212(a) of Public Law 93&ndash;66), in amounts which in the aggregate do not exceed (for any month) the lesser of (I) the amount of his or their benefit under this subchapter for that month or (II) an amount equal to 10 percent of his or their income for that month (including such benefit but excluding payments under subchapter II of this chapter when recovery is made from subchapter II payments pursuant to section 1320b&ndash;17 of this title and excluding income excluded pursuant to section 1382a(b) of this title), and in the case of an individual or eligible spouse to whom a lump sum is payable under this subchapter (including under section 1382e(a) of this title or under an agreement entered into under section 212(a) of Public Law 93&ndash;66) shall, as at least one means of recovering such overpayment, make the adjustment or recovery from the lump sum payment in an amount equal to not less than the lesser of the amount of the overpayment or the lump sum payment, unless fraud, willful misrepresentation, or concealment of material information was involved on the part of the individual or spouse in connection with the overpayment, or unless the individual requests that such adjustment or recovery be made at a higher or lower rate and the Commissioner of Social Security determines that adjustment or recovery at such rate is justified and appropriate. The availability (in the case of an individual who has been paid more than the correct amount of benefits) of procedures for adjustment or recovery at a limited rate under clause (ii) of the preceding sentence shall not, in and of itself, prevent or restrict the provision (in such case) of more substantial relief under clause (i) of such sentence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If any overpayment with respect to an individual (or an individual and his or her spouse) is attributable solely to the ownership or possession by such individual (and spouse if any) of resources having a value which exceeds the applicable dollar figure specified in paragraph (1)(B) or (2)(B) of section 1382(a) of this title by $50 or less, such individual (and spouse if any) shall be deemed for purposes of the second sentence of paragraph (1) to have been without fault in connection with the overpayment, and no adjustment or recovery shall be made under the first sentence of such paragraph, unless the Commissioner of Social Security finds that the failure of such individual (and spouse if any) to report such value correctly and in a timely manner was knowing and willful.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) With respect to any delinquent amount, the Commissioner of Social Security may use the collection practices described in sections 3711(f), 3716, 3717, and 3718 of title 31 and in section 5514 of title 5, all as in effect immediately after April 26, 1996.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) In the case of payment of less than the correct amount of benefits to or on behalf of any individual, no payment shall be made to such individual pursuant to this subsection during any period for which such individual&mdash;</p>

The Commissioner of Social Security shall provide reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing to any individual who is or claims to be an eligible individual or eligible spouse and is in disagreement with any determination under this subchapter with respect to eligibility of such individual for benefits, or the amount of such individual's benefits, if such individual requests a hearing on the matter in disagreement within sixty days after notice of such determination is received, and, if a hearing is held, shall, on the basis of evidence adduced at the hearing affirm, modify, or reverse the Commissioner's findings of fact and such decision. The Commissioner of Social Security is further authorized, on the Commissioner's own motion, to hold such hearings and to conduct such investigations and other proceedings as the Commissioner may deem necessary or proper for the administration of this subchapter. In the course of any hearing, investigation, or other proceeding, the Commissioner may administer oaths and affirmations, examine witnesses, and receive evidence.

<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A failure to timely request review of an initial adverse determination with respect to an application for any payment under this subchapter or an adverse determination on reconsideration of such an initial determination shall not serve as a basis for denial of a subsequent application for any payment under this subchapter if the applicant demonstrates that the applicant, or any other individual referred to in subparagraph (A), failed to so request such a review acting in good faith reliance upon incorrect, incomplete, or misleading information, relating to the consequences of reapplying for payments in lieu of seeking review of an adverse determination, provided by any officer or employee of the Social Security Administration or any State agency acting under section 421 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Determination on the basis of such hearing, except to the extent that the matter in disagreement involves a disability (within the meaning of section 1382c(a)(3) of this title), shall be made within ninety days after the individual requests the hearing as provided in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="note-body">Enactment of subchapter XVI of the Social Security Act [this subchapter] by section 301 of Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, eff. Jan. 1, 1974, was not applicable to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. See section 303(b) of Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, set out as a note under section 301 of this title. Therefore, as to Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Virgin Islands, section 1605 of the Social Security Act [this section] as it existed prior to reenactment of this subchapter by Pub. L. 92&ndash;603, and as amended, continues to apply and to read as follows:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&sect;1385. Definitions</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;aid to the aged, blind, or disabled&rdquo; means money payments to needy individuals who are 65 years of age or older, are blind, or are 18 years of age or over and permanently and totally disabled, but such term does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) any such payments to or care in behalf of any individual who is an inmate of a public institution (except as a patient in a medical institution); or</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) any such payments to or care in behalf of any individual who has not attained 65 years of age and who is a patient in an institution for tuberculosis or mental diseases.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">Such term also includes payments which are not included within the meaning of such term under the preceding sentence, but which would be so included except that they are made on behalf of such a needy individual to another individual who (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Commissioner of Social Security) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such needy individual, but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 1382 of this title includes provision for&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) determination by the State agency that such needy individual has, by reason of his physical or mental condition, such inability to manage funds that making payments to him would be contrary to his welfare and, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid through payments described in this sentence;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) making such payments only in cases in which such payments will, under the rules otherwise applicable under the State plan for determining need and the amount of aid to the aged, blind, or disabled to be paid (and in conjunction with other income and resources), meet all the need [sic] of the individuals with respect to whom such payments are made;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) undertaking and continuing special efforts to protect the welfare of such individual and to improve, to the extent possible, his capacity for self-care and to manage funds;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(D) periodic review by such State agency of the determination under clause (A) of this subsection to ascertain whether conditions justifying such determination still exist, with provision for termination of such payments if they do not and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative, as described in section 1311 of this title, if and when it appears that such action will best serve the interests of such needy individual; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(E) opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on the determination referred to in clause (A) of this subsection for any individual with respect to whom it is made.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">At the option of a State (if its plan approved under this subchapter so provides), such term (i) need not include money payments to an individual who has been absent from such State for a period in excess of ninety consecutive days (regardless of whether he has maintained his residence in such State during such period) until he has been present in such State for thirty consecutive days in the case of such an individual who has maintained his residence in such State during such period or ninety consecutive days in the case of any other such individual, and (ii) may include rent payments made directly to a public housing agency on behalf of a recipient or a group or groups of recipients of aid under such plan.</p>
