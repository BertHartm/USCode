<p class="statutory-body">(1) From the sums appropriated under subsections (a) through (d) of section 3023 of this title for each fiscal year, each State shall be allotted an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of older individuals in such State bears to the population of older individuals in all States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining the amounts allotted to States from the sums appropriated under section 3023 of this title for a fiscal year, the Assistant Secretary shall first determine the amount allotted to each State under paragraph (1) and then proportionately adjust such amounts, if necessary, to meet the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) No State shall be allotted less than 1/2 of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be allotted not less than 1/16 of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made. For the purposes of the exception contained in subparagraph (A) only, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not include Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) No State shall be allotted less than the total amount allotted to the State for fiscal year 2000 and no State shall receive a percentage increase above the fiscal year 2000 allotment that is less than 20 percent of the percentage increase above the fiscal year 2000 allotments for all of the States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The number of individuals aged 60 or older in any State and in all States shall be determined by the Assistant Secretary on the basis of the most recent data available from the Bureau of the Census, and other reliable demographic data satisfactory to the Assistant Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) State allotments for a fiscal year under this section shall be proportionally reduced to the extent that appropriations may be insufficient to provide the full allotments of the prior year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unused funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that any amount allotted to a State under part B or C of this subchapter, or subpart I of part E of this subchapter, for a fiscal year under this section will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Assistant Secretary shall make such allotment available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Assistant Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this subchapter, be regarded as part of such State's allotment (as determined under subsection (a) of this section) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Withholding of funds; disbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Assistant Secretary finds that any State has failed to qualify under the State plan requirements of section 3027 of this title or the Assistant Secretary does not approve the funding formula required under section 3025(a)(2)(C) of this title, the Assistant Secretary shall withhold the allotment of funds to such State referred to in subsection (a) of this section. The Assistant Secretary shall disburse the funds so withheld directly to any public or private nonprofit institution or organization, agency, or political subdivision of such State submitting an approved plan under section 3027 of this title, which includes an agreement that any such payment shall be matched in the proportion determined under subsection (d)(1)(D) of this section for such State, by funds or in-kind resources from non-Federal sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Costs of administration, ombudsman program, demonstration projects, supportive services, senior centers and nutrition services; payment and determination of non-Federal share</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) From any State's allotment, after the application of section 3028(b) of this title, under this section for any fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such amount as the State agency determines, but not more than 10 percent thereof, shall be available for paying such percentage as the agency determines, but not more than 75 percent, of the cost of administration of area plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such amount (excluding any amount attributable to funds appropriated under section <!-- PDFPage:4057 -->3023(a)(3) of this title) as the State agency determines to be adequate for conducting an effective ombudsman program under section 3027(a)(9) of this title shall be available for conducting such program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not less than $150,000 and not more than 4 percent of the amount allotted to the State for carrying out part B of this subchapter, shall be available for conducting outreach demonstration projects under section 3058e of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the remainder of such allotment shall be available to such State only for paying such percentage as the State agency determines, but not more than 85 percent of the cost of supportive services, senior centers, and nutrition services under this subchapter provided in the State as part of a comprehensive and coordinated system in planning and service areas for which there is an area plan approved by the State agency.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The non-Federal share shall be in cash or in kind. In determining the amount of the non-Federal share, the Assistant Secretary may attribute fair market value to services and facilities contributed from non-Federal sources.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Notice and hearing prior to disapproval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Assistant Secretary shall not make a final determination disapproving any State plan, or any modification thereof, or make a final determination that a State is ineligible under section 3025 of this title, without first affording the State reasonable notice and opportunity for a hearing.</p>

Until the Assistant Secretary is so satisfied, no further payments shall be made to such State from its allotments under section 3024 of this title and section 3028 of this title (or payments shall be limited to projects under or portions of the State plan not affected by such failure).

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Upon the filing of such petition, the court shall have jurisdiction to affirm the action of the Assistant Secretary or to set it aside, in whole or in part, temporarily or permanently, but until the filing of the record, the Assistant Secretary may modify or set aside the Assistant Secretary's order. The findings of the Assistant Secretary as to the facts, if supported by substantial evidence, shall be conclusive, but the court, for good cause shown, may remand the case to the Assistant Secretary to take further evidence, and the Assistant Secretary shall, within 30 days, file in the court the record of those further proceedings. Such new or modified findings of fact shall likewise be conclusive if supported by substantial evidence. The judgment of the court affirming or setting aside, in whole or in part, any action of the Assistant Secretary shall be final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States upon certiorari or certification as provided in section 1254 of title 28.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payment rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State permits the cost sharing described in paragraph (1), such State shall establish a sliding scale, based solely on individual income and the cost of delivering services.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An area agency on aging may request a waiver to the State's cost sharing policies, and the State shall approve such a waiver if the area agency on aging can adequately demonstrate that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) cost sharing would be an unreasonable administrative or financial burden upon the area agency on aging.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4087 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Voluntary contributions</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Required acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The area agency on aging shall ensure that each service provider will&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Prior to the implementation of cost sharing under subsection (a) of this section, each State and area agency on aging shall develop plans that are designed to ensure that the participation of low-income older individuals (with particular attention to low-income minority individuals and older individuals residing in rural areas) receiving services will not decrease with the implementation of the cost sharing under such subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Evaluation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after November 13, 2000, and annually thereafter, the Assistant Secretary shall conduct a comprehensive evaluation of practices for cost sharing to determine its impact on participation rates with particular attention to low-income and minority older individuals and older individuals residing in rural areas. If the Assistant Secretary finds that there is a disparate impact upon low-income or minority older individuals or older individuals residing in rural areas in any State or region within the State regarding the provision of services, the Assistant Secretary shall take corrective action to assure that such services are provided to all older individuals without regard to the cost sharing criteria.</p>
