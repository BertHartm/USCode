<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Administrator, in consultation with public water systems, environmental groups, public interest groups, risk communication experts, and the States, and other interested parties, shall issue regulations within 24 months after August 6, 1996, to require each community water system to mail to each customer of the system at least once annually a report on the level of contaminants in the drinking water purveyed by that system (referred to in this paragraph as a &ldquo;consumer confidence report&rdquo;). Such regulations shall provide a brief and plainly worded definition of the terms &ldquo;maximum contaminant level goal&rdquo;, &ldquo;maximum contaminant level&rdquo;, &ldquo;variances&rdquo;, and &ldquo;exemptions&rdquo; and brief statements in plain language regarding the health concerns that resulted in regulation of each regulated contaminant. The regulations shall also include a brief and plainly worded explanation regarding contaminants that may reasonably be expected to be present in drinking water, including bottled water.

<!-- PDFPage:981 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) A statement that the presence of contaminants in drinking water does not necessarily indicate that the drinking water poses a health risk and that more information about contaminants and potential health effects can be obtained by calling the Environmental Protection Agency hotline.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">A public water system may include such additional information as it deems appropriate for public education. The Administrator may, for not more than 3 regulated contaminants other than those referred to in subclause (IV) of clause (iii), require a consumer confidence report under this paragraph to include the brief statement in plain language regarding the health concerns that resulted in regulation of the contaminant or contaminants concerned, as provided by the Administrator in regulations under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Governor of a State may determine not to apply the mailing requirement of subparagraph (A) to a community water system serving fewer than 10,000 persons. Any such system shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) inform, in the newspaper notice required by clause (iii) or by other means, its customers that the system will not be mailing the report as required by subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) make the consumer confidence report available upon request to the public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) publish the report referred to in subparagraph (A) annually in one or more local newspapers serving the area in which customers of the system are located.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Alternative to publication</h4>

If the community water system so elects, the system shall, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) prepare an annual consumer confidence report pursuant to subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide notice at least once per year to each of its customers by mail, by door-to-door delivery, by posting or by other means authorized by the regulations of the Administrator that the consumer confidence report is available upon request.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Alternative form and content</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State exercising primary enforcement responsibility may establish, by rule, after notice and public comment, alternative requirements with respect to the form and content of consumer confidence reports under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice of noncompliance with secondary drinking water regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever, on the basis of information available to him, the Administrator finds that within a reasonable time after national secondary drinking water regulations have been promulgated, one or more public water systems in a State do not comply with such secondary regulations, and that such noncompliance appears to result from a failure of such State to take reasonable action to assure that public water systems throughout such State meet such secondary regulations, he shall so notify the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State authority to adopt or enforce laws or regulations respecting drinking water regulations or public water systems unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this subchapter shall diminish any authority of a State or political subdivision to adopt or enforce any law or regulation respecting drinking water regulations or public water systems, but no such law or regulation shall relieve any person of any requirement otherwise applicable under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Notice and public hearing; availability of recommendations transmitted to State and public water system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Administrator makes a finding of noncompliance (described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) of this section) with respect to a public water system in a State which has primary enforcement responsibility, the Administrator may, for the purpose of assisting that State in carrying out such responsibility and upon the petition of such State or public water system or persons served by such system, hold, after appropriate notice, public hearings for the purpose of gathering information from technical or other experts, Federal, State, or other public officials, representatives of such public water system, persons served by such system, and other interested persons on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ways in which such system can within the earliest feasible time be brought into compliance with the regulation or requirement with respect to which such finding was made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the means for the maximum feasible protection of the public health during any period in which such system is not in compliance with a national primary drinking water regulation or requirement applicable to a variance or exemption.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">On the basis of such hearings the Administrator shall issue recommendations which shall be sent to such State and public water system and shall be made available to the public and communications media.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Administrative order requiring compliance; notice and hearing; civil penalty; civil actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which the Administrator is authorized to bring a civil action under this section or under section 300j&ndash;4 of this title with respect to any applicable requirement, the Administrator also may issue an order to require compliance with such applicable requirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An order issued under this subsection shall not take effect, in the case of a State having primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in that State, until after the Administrator has provided the State with an opportunity to confer with the Administrator regarding the order. A copy of any order issued <!-- PDFPage:982 -->under this subsection shall be sent to the appropriate State agency of the State involved if the State has primary enforcement responsibility for public water systems in that State. Any order issued under this subsection shall state with reasonable specificity the nature of the violation. In any case in which an order under this subsection is issued to a corporation, a copy of such order shall be issued to appropriate corporate officers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Any person who violates, or fails or refuses to comply with, an order under this subsection shall be liable to the United States for a civil penalty of not more than $25,000 per day of violation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In a case in which a civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this paragraph does not exceed $5,000, the penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator after notice and opportunity for a public hearing (unless the person against whom the penalty is assessed requests a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5). In a case in which a civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this paragraph exceeds $5,000, but does not exceed $25,000, the penalty shall be assessed by the Administrator after notice and opportunity for a hearing on the record in accordance with section 554 of title 5.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Whenever any civil penalty sought by the Administrator under this subsection for a violation of an applicable requirement exceeds $25,000, the penalty shall be assessed by a civil action brought by the Administrator in the appropriate United States district court (as determined under the provisions of title 28).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order, or after the appropriate court of appeals has entered final judgment in favor of the Administrator, the Attorney General shall recover the amount for which such person is liable in any appropriate district court of the United States. In any such action, the validity and appropriateness of the final order imposing the civil penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Consolidation incentive</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An owner or operator of a public water system may submit to the State in which the system is located (if the State has primary enforcement responsibility under section 300g&ndash;2 of this title) or to the Administrator (if the State does not have primary enforcement responsibility) a plan (including specific measures and schedules) for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the physical consolidation of the system with 1 or more other systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the consolidation of significant management and administrative functions of the system with 1 or more other systems; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the transfer of ownership of the system that may reasonably be expected to improve drinking water quality.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Consequences of approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the State or the Administrator approves a plan pursuant to paragraph (1), no enforcement action shall be taken pursuant to this part with respect to a specific violation identified in the approved plan prior to the date that is the earlier of the date on which consolidation is completed according to the plan or the date that is 2 years after the plan is approved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) &ldquo;Applicable requirement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;applicable requirement&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
