<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for financial assistance to public and nonprofit agencies; consultation with other Federal agencies to avoid duplication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner is authorized to provide financial assistance, on a single year or multiyear basis, to public and nonprofit private agencies, including but not limited to, governing bodies of Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations, Alaska Native villages and regional corporations established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], and such public and nonprofit private agencies serving Native Hawaiians, and Indian and Alaska Native organizations in urban or rural areas that are not Indian reservations or Alaska Native villages, for projects pertaining to the purposes of this subchapter. The Commissioner is authorized to provide financial assistance to public and nonprofit private agencies serving other Native American Pacific Islanders (including American Samoan Natives) for projects pertaining to the purposes of this Act. In determining the projects to be assisted under this subchapter, the Commissioner shall consult with other Federal agencies for the purpose of eliminating duplication or conflict among similar activities or projects and for the purpose of determining whether the findings resulting from those projects may be incorporated into one or more programs for which those agencies are responsible. Every determination made with respect to a request for financial assistance under this section shall be made without regard to whether the agency making such request serves, or the project to be assisted is for the benefit of, Indians who are not members of a federally recognized tribe. To the greatest extent practicable, the Commissioner shall ensure that each project to be assisted under this subchapter is consistent with the priorities established by the agency which receives such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations of financial assistance; exceptions; non-Federal contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Financial assistance extended to an agency under this subchapter shall not exceed 80 per centum of the approved costs of the assisted project, except that the Commissioner may approve assistance in excess of such percentage if the Commissioner determines, in accordance with regulations establishing objective criteria, that such action is required in furtherance of the purposes of this subchapter. Non-Federal contributions may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including but not limited to plant, equipment, and services. The Commissioner <!-- PDFPage:2993 -->shall not require non-Federal contributions in excess of 20 per centum of the approved costs of programs or activities assisted under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance as addition to, and not substitution for, activities previously carried out without Federal assistance; waiver; nonreservation areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No project shall be approved for assistance under this subchapter unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the activities to be carried out under such project will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, comparable activities previously carried out without Federal assistance, except that the Commissioner may waive this requirement in any case in which the Commissioner determines, in accordance with regulations establishing objective criteria, that application of the requirement would result in unnecessary hardship or otherwise be inconsistent with the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No project may be disapproved for assistance under this subchapter solely because the agency requesting such assistance is an Indian organization in a nonreservation area or serves Indians in a nonreservation area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Grants to improve tribal regulation of environmental quality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commissioner shall award grants to Indian tribes for the purpose of funding 80 percent of the costs of planning, developing, and implementing programs designed to improve the capability of the governing body of the Indian tribe to regulate environmental quality pursuant to Federal and tribal environmental laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The purposes for which funds provided under any grant awarded under paragraph (1) may be used include, but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the training and education of employees responsible for enforcing, or monitoring compliance with, environmental quality laws,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the development of tribal laws on environmental quality, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the enforcement and monitoring of environmental quality laws.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The 20 percent of the costs of planning, developing, and implementing a program for which a grant is awarded under paragraph (1) that are not to be paid from such grant may be paid by the grant recipient in cash or through the provision of property or services, but only to the extent that such cash or property is from any source (including any Federal agency) other than a program, contract, or grant authorized under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Grants shall be awarded under paragraph (1) on the basis of applications that are submitted by Indian tribes to the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Formula for computation of amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), from the sums appropriated under section 3023 of this title for each fiscal year, each State shall be allotted an amount which bears the same ratio to such sums as the population of older individuals in such State bears to the population of older individuals in all States, except that (A) no State shall be allotted less than one-half of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; (B) Guam, the United States Virgin Islands, and the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, shall each be allotted not less than one-fourth of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made; and (C) American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands shall each be allotted not less than one-sixteenth of 1 percent of the sum appropriated for the fiscal year for which the determination is made. For the purposes of paragraph (3) and the exception contained in subparagraph (A) only, the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; does not include Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands, and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) No State shall be allotted, from the amount appropriated under section 3023(g) of this title, less than $50,000 for any fiscal year.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Unused funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever the Assistant Secretary determines that any amount allotted to a State under part B or C of this subchapter for a fiscal year under this section will not be used by such State for carrying out the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Assistant Secretary shall make such allotment available for carrying out such purpose to one or more other States to the extent the Assistant Secretary determines that such other States will be able to use such additional amount for carrying out such purpose. Any amount made available to a State from an appropriation for a fiscal year in accordance with the preceding sentence shall, for purposes of this subchapter, be regarded as part of such State's allotment (as determined under subsection (a) of this section) for such year, but shall remain available until the end of the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Withholding of funds; disbursement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Assistant Secretary finds that any State has failed to qualify under the State plan requirements of section 3027 of this title or the Assistant Secretary does not approve the funding formula required under section 3025(a)(2)(C) of this title, the Assistant Secretary shall withhold the allotment of funds to such State referred to in subsection (a) of this section. The Assistant Secretary shall disburse the funds so withheld directly to any public or private nonprofit institution or organization, agency, or political subdivision of such State submitting an approved plan under section 3027 of this title, which includes an agreement that any such payment shall be matched in the proportion determined under subsection (d)(1)(D) of this section for such State, by funds or in-kind resources from non-Federal sources.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) From any State's allotment, after the application of section 3028(b) of this title, under this section for any fiscal year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such amount as the State agency determines, but not more than 10 percent thereof, shall be available for paying such percentage as the agency determines, but not more than 75 percent, of the cost of administration of area plans;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such amount (excluding any amount attributable to funds appropriated under section 3023(a)(3) of this title) as the State agency determines to be adequate for conducting an effective ombudsman program under section 3027(a)(12) of this title shall be available for conducting such program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not less than $150,000 and not more than 4 percent of the amount allotted to the State for carrying out part B of this subchapter, shall be available for conducting outreach demonstration projects under section 3058e of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the remainder of such allotment shall be available to such State only for paying such percentage as the State agency determines, but not more than 85 percent of the cost of supportive services, senior centers, and nutrition services under this subchapter provided in the State as part of a comprehensive and coordinated system in planning and service areas for which there is an area plan approved by the State agency.</p>
