<h4 class="note-head">Alaska Federation of Natives&rsquo; Study and Report With Proposals To Implement Recommendations of Alaska Natives Commission</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 104&ndash;270, Oct. 9, 1996, 110 Stat. 3301, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS AND DECLARATION OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds and declares the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Joint Federal-State Commission on Policies and Programs Affecting Alaska Natives (hereafter in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Alaska Natives Commission&rsquo;) was established by Public Law 101&ndash;379 (42 U.S.C. 2991a note) following the publication in 1989 of the &lsquo;Report on the Status of Alaska Natives: A Call for Action&rsquo; by the Alaska Federation of Natives and after extensive congressional hearings which focused on the need for the first comprehensive assessment of the social, cultural, and economic condition of Alaska's 86,000 Natives since the enactment of the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, Public Law 92&ndash;203 [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The 14-member Alaska Natives Commission held 15 regional hearings throughout Alaska between July 1992 and October 1993, and 2 statewide hearings in Anchorage coinciding with the Conventions of 1992 and 1993 of the Alaska Federation of Natives. In May 1994, the Alaska Natives Commission issued its 3 volume, 440 page report. As required by Public Law 101&ndash;379, the report was formally conveyed to the Congress, the President of the United States, and the Governor of Alaska.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Alaska Natives Commission found that many Alaska Native individuals, families, and communities were experiencing a social, cultural, and economic crisis marked by rampant unemployment, lack of economic opportunity, alcohol abuse, depression, and morbidity and mortality rates that have been described by health care professionals as &lsquo;staggering&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Alaska Natives Commission found that due to the high rate of unemployment and lack of economic opportunities for Alaska Natives, government programs for the poor have become the foundation of <!-- PDFPage:4034 -->many village economies. Displacing traditional Alaska Native social safety nets, these well-meaning programs have undermined the healthy interdependence and self-sufficiency of Native tribes and families and have put Native tribes and families at risk of becoming permanent dependencies of Government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Despite these seemingly insurmountable problems, the Alaska Natives Commission found that Alaska Natives, building on the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, had begun a unique process of critical self-examination which, if supported by the United States Congress through innovative legislation, and effective public administration at all levels including traditional Native governance, could provide the basis for an Alaska Native social, cultural, economic, and spiritual renewal.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Alaska Natives Commission recognized that the key to the future well-being of Alaska Natives lay in&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the systematic resumption of responsibility by Alaska Natives for the well-being of their members,</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the strengthening of their economies,</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the strengthening, operation, and control of their systems of governance, social services, education, health care, and law enforcement, and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) exercising rights they have from their special relationship with the Federal Government and as citizens of the United States and Alaska.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The Alaska Natives Commission recognized that the following 3 basic principles must be respected in addressing the myriad of problems facing Alaska Natives:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Self-reliance.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Self-determination.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Integrity of Native cultures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) There is a need to address the problems confronting Alaska Natives. This should be done rapidly, with certainty, and in conformity with the real economic, social, and cultural needs of Alaska Natives.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Congress retains and has exercised its constitutional authority over Native affairs in Alaska subsequent to the Treaty of Cession and does so now through this Act.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. ALASKA NATIVE IMPLEMENTATION STUDY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Consideration of Local Control</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In developing its recommendations pursuant to subsection (c)(4), the Alaska Federation of Natives shall give specific attention to the ways in which the recommendations may be achieved at the local level with maximum local control of the implementation of the recommendations.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2991b. Financial assistance for Native American projects</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization for financial assistance to public and nonprofit agencies; consultation with other Federal agencies to avoid duplication</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner is authorized to provide financial assistance, on a single year or multiyear basis, to public and nonprofit private agencies, including but not limited to, governing bodies of Indian tribes on Federal and State reservations, Alaska Native villages and regional corporations established by the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act [43 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.], and such public and nonprofit private agencies serving Native Hawaiians, and Indian and Alaska Native organizations in urban or rural areas that are not Indian reservations or Alaska Native villages, for projects pertaining to the purposes of this subchapter. The Commissioner is author<!-- PDFPage:4035 -->ized to provide financial assistance to public and nonprofit private agencies serving other Native American Pacific Islanders (including American Samoan Natives) for projects pertaining to the purposes of this Act. In determining the projects to be assisted under this subchapter, the Commissioner shall consult with other Federal agencies for the purpose of eliminating duplication or conflict among similar activities or projects and for the purpose of determining whether the findings resulting from those projects may be incorporated into one or more programs for which those agencies are responsible. Every determination made with respect to a request for financial assistance under this section shall be made without regard to whether the agency making such request serves, or the project to be assisted is for the benefit of, Indians who are not members of a federally recognized tribe. To the greatest extent practicable, the Commissioner shall ensure that each project to be assisted under this subchapter is consistent with the priorities established by the agency which receives such assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitations of financial assistance; exceptions; non-Federal contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Financial assistance extended to an agency under this subchapter shall not exceed 80 per centum of the approved costs of the assisted project, except that the Commissioner may approve assistance in excess of such percentage if the Commissioner determines, in accordance with regulations establishing objective criteria, that such action is required in furtherance of the purposes of this subchapter. Non-Federal contributions may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including but not limited to plant, equipment, and services. The Commissioner shall not require non-Federal contributions in excess of 20 per centum of the approved costs of programs or activities assisted under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance as addition to, and not substitution for, activities previously carried out without Federal assistance; waiver; nonreservation areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No project shall be approved for assistance under this subchapter unless the Commissioner is satisfied that the activities to be carried out under such project will be in addition to, and not in substitution for, comparable activities previously carried out without Federal assistance, except that the Commissioner may waive this requirement in any case in which the Commissioner determines, in accordance with regulations establishing objective criteria, that application of the requirement would result in unnecessary hardship or otherwise be inconsistent with the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No project may be disapproved for assistance under this subchapter solely because the agency requesting such assistance is an Indian organization in a nonreservation area or serves Indians in a nonreservation area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Grants to improve tribal regulation of environmental quality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Commissioner shall award grants to Indian tribes for the purpose of funding 80 percent of the costs of planning, developing, and implementing programs designed to improve the capability of the governing body of the Indian tribe to regulate environmental quality pursuant to Federal and tribal environmental laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The purposes for which funds provided under any grant awarded under paragraph (1) may be used include, but are not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the training and education of employees responsible for enforcing, or monitoring compliance with, environmental quality laws,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the development of tribal laws on environmental quality, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the enforcement and monitoring of environmental quality laws.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The 20 percent of the costs of planning, developing, and implementing a program for which a grant is awarded under paragraph (1) that are not to be paid from such grant may be paid by the grant recipient in cash or through the provision of property or services, but only to the extent that such cash or property is from any source (including any Federal agency) other than a program, contract, or grant authorized under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Grants shall be awarded under paragraph (1) on the basis of applications that are submitted by Indian tribes to the Commissioner in such form as the Commissioner shall prescribe.</p>
