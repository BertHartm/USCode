<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">From the amounts referred to in paragraph (1) with respect to a State (in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;local amount&rdquo;), the Attorney General shall allocate to each unit of local government an amount which bears the same ratio to such share as the average annual number of part 1 violent crimes reported by such unit to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the 3 most recent calendar years for which such data is available bears to the number of part 1 violent crimes reported by all units of local government in the State in which the unit is located to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for such years.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transitional rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding subparagraph (A), for fiscal years 2006, 2007, and 2008, the Attorney General shall allocate the local amount to units of local government in the same manner that, under the Local Government Law Enforcement Block Grants program in effect immediately before January 5, 2006, the reserved amount was allocated among reporting and nonreporting units of local government.</p>

Such application shall specify the amount of such funds that are to be distributed to each of the units of local government and the purposes for which such funds are to be used. The units of local government involved may establish a joint local advisory board for the purposes of carrying out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;geographically constituent unit of local government&rdquo; means a unit of local government that has jurisdiction over areas located within the boundaries of an area over which a unit of local government certified pursuant to clause (i) has jurisdiction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation on allocations to units of local government</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Maximum allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No unit of local government shall receive a total allocation under this section that exceeds such unit's total expenditures on criminal justice services for the most recently completed fiscal year for which data are available. Any amount in excess of such total expenditures shall be allocated proportionally among units of local government whose allocations under this section do not exceed their total expenditures on such services.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Allocations under $10,000</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the allocation under this section to a unit of local government is less than $10,000 for any fiscal year, the direct grant to the State under subsection (c) of this section shall be increased by the amount of such allocation, to be distributed (for the purposes described in section 3751 of this title) among State police departments that provide criminal justice services to units of local government and units of local government whose allocation under this section is less than $10,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-reporting units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No allocation under this section shall be made to a unit of local government that has not reported at least three years of data on part 1 violent crimes of the Uniform Crime Reports to the Federal Bureau of Investigation within the immediately preceding 10 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Funds not used by the State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Attorney General determines, on the basis of information available during any grant period, that any allocation (or portion thereof) under this section to a State for such grant period will not be required, or that a State will be unable to qualify or receive funds under this part, or that a State chooses not to participate in the program established under this part, then such State's allocation (or portion thereof) shall be awarded by the Attorney General to units of local government, or combinations thereof, within such State, giving priority to those jurisdictions with the highest annual number of part 1 violent crimes of the Uniform Crime Reports reported by the unit of local government to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the three most recent calendar years for which such data are available.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4364 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Special rules for Puerto Rico</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) All funds set aside for Commonwealth government</h4>
