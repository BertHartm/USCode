<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7384. Findings; sense of Congress</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Since World War II, Federal nuclear activities have been explicitly recognized under Federal law as activities that are ultra-hazardous. Nuclear weapons production and testing have involved unique dangers, including potential catastrophic nuclear accidents that private insurance carriers have not covered and recurring exposures to radioactive substances and beryllium that, even in small amounts, can cause medical harm.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Since the inception of the nuclear weapons program and for several decades afterwards, a large number of nuclear weapons workers at sites of the Department of Energy and at sites of vendors who supplied the Cold War effort were put at risk without their knowledge and consent for reasons that, documents reveal, were driven by fears of adverse publicity, liability, and employee demands for hazardous duty pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Many previously secret records have documented unmonitored exposures to radiation and beryllium and continuing problems at these sites across the Nation, at which the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies have been, since World War II, self-regulating with respect to nuclear safety and occupational safety and health. No other hazardous Federal activity has been permitted to be carried out under such sweeping powers of self-regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The policy of the Department of Energy has been to litigate occupational illness claims, which has deterred workers from filing workers&rsquo; compensation claims and has imposed major financial burdens for such employees who have sought compensation. Contractors of the Department have been held harmless and the employees have been denied workers&rsquo; compensation coverage for occupational disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Over the past 20 years, more than two dozen scientific findings have emerged that indicate that certain of such employees are experiencing increased risks of dying from cancer and non-malignant diseases. Several of these studies have also established a correlation between excess diseases and exposure to radiation and beryllium.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) While linking exposure to occupational hazards with the development of occupational disease is sometimes difficult, scientific evidence supports the conclusion that occupational exposure to dust particles or vapor of beryllium can cause beryllium sensitivity and chronic beryllium disease. Furthermore, studies indicate than 98 percent of radiation-induced cancers within the nuclear weapons complex have occurred at dose levels below existing maximum safe thresholds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Existing information indicates that State workers&rsquo; compensation programs do not provide a uniform means of ensuring adequate compensation for the types of occupational illnesses and diseases that relate to the employees at those sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To ensure fairness and equity, the civilian men and women who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the Department of Energy and its <!-- PDFPage:5089 -->predecessor agencies should have efficient, uniform, and adequate compensation for beryllium-related health conditions and radiation-related health conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) On April 12, 2000, the Secretary of Energy announced that the Administration intended to seek compensation for individuals with a broad range of work-related illnesses throughout the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) However, as of October 2, 2000, the Administration has failed to provide Congress with the necessary legislative and budget proposals to enact the promised compensation program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a program should be established to provide compensation to covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a fund for payment of such compensation should be established on the books of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) payments from that fund should be made only after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the identification of employees of the Department of Energy (including its predecessor agencies), and of contractors of the Department, who may be members of the group of covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of a process to receive and administer claims for compensation for disability or death of covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the submittal by the President of a legislative proposal for compensation of such employees that includes the estimated annual budget resources for that compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) consideration by the Congress of the legislative proposal submitted by the President; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) payments from that fund should commence not later than fiscal year 2002.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13179. Providing Compensation to America's Nuclear Weapons Workers</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13179, Dec. 7, 2000, 65 F.R. 77487, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including Public Law 106&ndash;398, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.] (Public Law 106&ndash;398, the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), and to allocate the responsibilities imposed by that legislation and to provide for further legislative efforts, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women have served their Nation in building its nuclear defense. In the course of their work, they overcame previously unimagined scientific and technical challenges. Thousands of these courageous Americans, however, paid a high price for their service, developing disabling or fatal illnesses as a result of exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards unique to nuclear weapons production and testing. Too often, these workers were neither adequately protected from, nor informed of, the occupational hazards to which they were exposed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Existing workers&rsquo; compensation programs have failed to provide for the needs of these workers and their families. Federal workers&rsquo; compensation programs have generally not included these workers. Further, because of long latency periods, the uniqueness of the hazards to which they were exposed, and inadequate exposure data, many of these individuals have been unable to obtain State workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. This problem has been exacerbated by the past policy of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessors of encouraging and assisting DOE contractors in opposing the claims of workers who sought those benefits. This policy has recently been reversed.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the Nation can never fully repay these workers or their families, they deserve recognition and compensation for their sacrifices. Since the Administration's historic announcement in July of 1999 that it in<!-- PDFPage:5090 -->tended to compensate DOE nuclear weapons workers who suffered occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to the unique hazards in building the Nation's nuclear defense, it has been the policy of this Administration to support fair and timely compensation for these workers and their survivors. The Federal Government should provide necessary information and otherwise help employees of the DOE or its contractors determine if their illnesses are associated with conditions of their nuclear weapons-related work; it should provide workers and their survivors with all pertinent and available information necessary for evaluating and processing claims; and it should ensure that this program minimizes the administrative burden on workers and their survivors, and respects their dignity and privacy. This order sets out agency responsibilities to accomplish these goals, building on the Administration's articulated principles and the framework set forth in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.]. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Energy shall be responsible for developing and implementing actions under the Act to compensate these workers and their families in a manner that is compassionate, fair, and timely. Other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall assist in this effort.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Designation of Responsibilities for Administering the Energy Employees&rsquo; Occupational Illness Compensation Program (&ldquo;Program&rdquo;).</em></p>

<p class="note-body">(v) Pursuant to Subtitle D of the Act [42 U.S.C. 7385<em>o</em>], negotiate agreements with the chief executive officer of each State in which there is a DOE facility, and other States as appropriate, to provide assistance to a DOE contractor employee on filing a State workers&rsquo; compensation system claim, and establish a Worker Assistance Program to help individuals whose illness is related to employment in the DOE's nuclear weapons complex, or the individual's survivor if the individual is deceased, in applying for State workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. This assistance shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Submittal of reasonable claims to a physician panel, appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and administered by the Secretary of Energy, under procedures established by the Secretary of Energy, for determination of whether the individual's illness or death arose out of and in the course of employment by the DOE or its contractors and exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) For cases determined by the physician panel and the Secretary of Energy under section 3661(d) and (e) of the Act [42 U.S.C. 7385<em>o</em>(d), (e)] to have arisen out of and in the course of employment by the DOE or its contractors and exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility, provide assistance to the individual in filing for workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. The Secretary shall not contest these claims and, to the extent permitted by law, shall direct a DOE contractor who employed the applicant not to contest the claim;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) Report on the Worker Assistance Program by making publicly available on at least an annual basis claims-related data, including the number of claims filed, the number of illnesses found to be related to work at a DOE facility, job location and description, and number of successful State workers&rsquo; compensation claims awarded; and</p>

L. 101&ndash;426, 42 U.S.C. 2210 note] has been or is ap<!-- PDFPage:5091 -->proved by the Department of Justice, of the availability of supplemental compensation and benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) Identify and notify eligible covered uranium employees or their survivors of the availability of supplemental compensation under the Program; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) Upon request by the Secretary of Labor, provide information needed to adjudicate the claim of a covered uranium employee under this Program.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Establishment of Interagency Working Group.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) There is hereby established an Interagency Working Group to be composed of representatives from the Office of Management and Budget, the National Economic Council, and the Departments of Labor, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Justice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">during a period when beryllium dust, particles, or vapor may have been present at such facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Cancer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An individual with cancer specified in subclause (I), (II), or (III) of section 7384<em>l</em>(9)(B)(ii) of this title shall be determined to have sustained that cancer in the performance of duty for purposes of the compensation program if, and only if, the cancer specified in that subclause was at least as likely as not related to employment at the facility specified in that subclause, as determined in accordance with the guidelines established under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of the compensation program, the President shall by regulation establish guidelines for making the determinations required by subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President shall establish such guidelines after technical review by the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health under section 7384<em>o</em> of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Such guidelines shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be based on the radiation dose received by the employee (or a group of employees performing similar work) at such facility and the upper 99 percent confidence interval of the probability of causation in the radioepidemiological tables published under section 7(b) of the Orphan Drug Act (42 U.S.C. 241 note), as such tables may be updated under section 7(b)(3) of such Act from time to time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) incorporate the methods established under subsection (d) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) take into consideration the type of cancer, past health-related activities (such as smoking), information on the risk of developing a radiation-related cancer from workplace exposure, and other relevant factors.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Methods for radiation dose reconstructions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President shall, through any Federal agency (other than the Department of Energy) or official (other than the Secretary of Energy or any other official within the Department of Energy) that the President may designate, establish by regulation methods for arriving at reasonable estimates of the radiation doses received by an individual specified in subparagraph (B) of section 7384<em>l</em>(9) of this title at a facility specified in that subparagraph by each of the following employees:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) An employee who was not monitored for exposure to radiation at such facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) An employee who was monitored inadequately for exposure to radiation at such facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An employee whose records of exposure to radiation at such facility are missing or incomplete.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President shall establish an independent review process using the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) assess the methods established under paragraph (1); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) verify a reasonable sample of the doses established under paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Information on radiation doses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Energy shall provide, to each covered employee with cancer specified in section 7384<em>l</em>(9)(B) of this title, information specifying the estimated radiation dose of that employee during each employment specified in section 7384<em>l</em>(9)(B) of this title, whether established by a dosimetry reading, by a method established under subsection (d) of this section, or by both a dosimetry reading and such method.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Health and Human Services and the Secretary of Energy shall each make available to researchers and the general public information on the assumptions, methodology, and data used in establishing radiation doses under subsection (d) of this section. The actions taken under this paragraph shall be consistent with the protection of private medical records.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health under section 7384<em>o</em> of this title shall advise the President whether there is a class of employees at any Department of Energy facility who likely were exposed to radiation at that facility but for whom it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose they received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The advice of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health under paragraph (1) shall be based on exposure assessments by radiation health professionals, information provided by the Department of Energy, and such other information as the Advisory Board considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The President shall request advice under paragraph (1) after consideration of petitions by classes of employees described in that paragraph for such advice. The President shall consider such petitions pursuant to procedures established by the President.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7384r. Separate treatment of chronic silicosis</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that employees who worked in Department of Energy test sites and later con<!-- PDFPage:5097 -->tracted chronic silicosis should also be considered for inclusion in the compensation program. Recognizing that chronic silicosis resulting from exposure to silica is not a condition unique to the nuclear weapons industry, it is not the intent of Congress with this subchapter to establish a precedent on the question of chronic silicosis as a compensable occupational disease. Consequently, it is the sense of Congress that a further determination by the President is appropriate before these workers are included in the compensation program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification by President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A covered employee with chronic silicosis shall be treated as a covered employee (as defined in section 7384<em>l</em>(1) of this title) for the purposes of the compensation program required by section 7384d of this title unless the President submits to Congress not later than 180 days after October 30, 2000, the certification of the President that there is insufficient basis to include such employees. The President shall submit with the certification any recommendations about the compensation program with respect to covered employees with chronic silicosis as the President considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exposure to silica in the performance of duty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A covered employee shall, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, be determined to have been exposed to silica in the performance of duty for the purposes of the compensation program if, and only if, the employee was present for a number of work days aggregating at least 250 work days during the mining of tunnels at a Department of Energy facility located in Nevada or Alaska for tests or experiments related to an atomic weapon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Covered employee with chronic silicosis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;covered employee with chronic silicosis&rdquo; means a Department of Energy employee, or a Department of Energy contractor employee, with chronic silicosis who was exposed to silica in the performance of duty as determined under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Chronic silicosis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;chronic silicosis&rdquo; means a nonmalignant lung disease if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the initial occupational exposure to silica dust preceded the onset of silicosis by at least 10 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a written diagnosis of silicosis is made by a medical doctor and is accompanied by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a chest radiograph, interpreted by an individual certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as a B reader, classifying the existence of pneumoconioses of category 1/0 or higher;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) results from a computer assisted tomograph or other imaging technique that are consistent with silicosis; or</p>
