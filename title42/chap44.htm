<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby declares that the general welfare and security of the Nation and the health and living standards of our people require, as a matter of national purpose, sound development of the Nation's communities and metropolitan areas in which the vast majority of its people live and work.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">To carry out such purpose, and in recognition of the increasing importance of housing and urban development in our national life, the Congress finds that establishment of an executive department is desirable to achieve the best administration of the principal programs of the Federal Government which provide assistance for housing and for the development of the Nation's communities; to assist the President in achieving maximum coordination of the various Federal activities which have a major effect upon urban community, suburban, or metropolitan development; to encourage the solution of problems of housing, urban development, and mass transportation through State, county, town, village, or other local and private action, including promotion of interstate, regional, and metropolitan cooperation; to encourage the maximum contributions that may be made by vigorous private homebuilding and mortgage lending industries to housing, urban development, and the national economy; and to provide for full and appropriate consideration, at the national level, of the needs and interests of the Nation's communities and of the people who live and work in them.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. The Nation's housing stock represents an important national resource which must be preserved and well managed if public and private investments are to be protected, and if we are to meet our goal of providing a decent home and suitable living environment for low and moderate income residents. The production of Federally-assisted housing has greatly expanded in recent years, creating a need for a balanced strategy to ensure that such housing remains viable for the purposes intended.</p>
<p class="note-body">This expansion also creates a need for a growing supply of new management manpower for the years ahead. Special skills must be developed among these managers so that they can effectively overcome the social and economic problems facing many residents of Federally-assisted housing, including the elderly. Training, the improvement of career opportunities, and the upgrading of industry standards are all essential to the improvement of the Nation's housing management capability, particularly for low and moderate income housing.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Establishment of a National Center for Housing Management</em>. (a) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is directed to call upon public-spirited citizens, dedicated and experienced in the appropriate disciplines, to create, in accordance with existing laws, a new, non-governmental, not-for-profit institution to serve as a National Center for Housing Management (referred to herein as the Center).</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Center should be designed to provide objective and independent leadership at the national level in helping meet the Nation's housing management and training needs and should work cooperatively with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and with the public and private organizations and institutions involved in, or affected by, its activities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Activities of the Center</em>. The activities of the Center should be developed along lines that include the following objectives:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Development of training and educational programs for housing management and personnel:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4240 --><p class="note-body">(2) Cooperation with public and private national, State, and local organizations and institutions in extending housing management training and educational opportunities, using to the fullest extent possible the services and facilities of existing agencies with expertise in training and education.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Cooperation with national, State, and local organizations and institutions in establishing or expanding recruitment and placement systems that will link training in housing management to job opportunities in that field.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Development of improved housing management practices and assistance in professionalizing the housing management industry; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Stimulating the creation of new management entities, and strengthening the effectiveness of existing management entities.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Assistance by Federal Agencies</em>. To the extent consistent with law, all other Federal executive departments and agencies shall cooperate and work with the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Center in providing appropriate advice and financial support so as to ensure that the above described objectives are carried out with the most effective and efficient use of Federal, State and local resources, both public and private.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Final orders</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If no hearing is requested within 15 days of receipt of the notice of opportunity for hearing, the imposition of the penalty shall constitute a final and unappealable order.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Objections not raised in hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The court shall not consider any objection that was not raised in the hearing conducted pursuant to paragraph (3)(A) unless a demonstration is made of extraordinary circumstances causing the failure to raise the objection. If any party demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that additional evi<!-- PDFPage:4253 -->dence not presented at such hearing is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to present such evidence at the hearing, the court shall remand the matter to the Secretary for consideration of such additional evidence.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Action to collect penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If any employee fails to comply with the Secretary's determination or order imposing a civil money penalty under paragraph (1), after the determination or order is no longer subject to review as provided by paragraphs (3)(A) and (4), the Secretary may request the Attorney General of the United States to bring an action in an appropriate United States district court to obtain a monetary judgment against the employee and such other relief as may be available. The monetary judgment may, in the court's discretion, include the attorneys&rsquo; fees and other expenses incurred by the United States in connection with the action. In an action under this subsection, the validity and appropriateness of the Secretary's determination or order imposing the penalty shall not be subject to review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that various departments, agencies, and instrumentalities of the Federal Government with responsibilities involving housing and housing finance programs, require, approve, use or otherwise employ a variety of different forms as residential mortgages (or deeds of trust or similar security instruments) as notes secured by those mortgages, and for applications, appraisals and other purposes, and that such duplication of forms constitutes a paperwork burden that adds to the costs imposed on the Nation's homeowners and home buyers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that unnecessary paperwork impairs the effectiveness of Federal housing and housing finance programs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that both single-family and multi-family programs are affected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that simplification of paperwork imposed by Federal housing and housing finance programs would contribute to achieving the Nation's housing goals by reducing housing costs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Uniform legal and other forms for use by agencies in housing programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than October 1, 1980, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, consistent with provisions of law governing the conduct of housing programs, employ in their respective programs&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a uniform application form for mortgage approval and commitment for mortgage insurance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a uniform form for computation of the monthly net effective income of applicants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a uniform property appraisal form;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a uniform settlement statement which shall satisfy the requirements of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 [12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) such other consolidated or simplified forms, particularly those which solicit identical or nearly identical information from the same persons in the conduct of two or more such programs, the consolidation or simplification of which the Secretaries of Housing and Urban Development and Agriculture and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs mutually agree would contribute to a reduction in the paperwork and regulatory burden of such programs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Secretary of Agriculture, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall, consistent with provisions of law governing their respective programs, provide by regulation for the elimination of forms which solicit information which is already available from other available sources through indexing or other means of identifying such forms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each agency referred to in subsection (b) of this section may employ riders, addenda, or similar forms of modification agreements to adapt such uniform forms to its respective programs and policies, consistent with the goals of minimizing the use and extent of such modification agreements and maximizing the suitability of such forms for the use of all participants, public and private.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Coordination and reports by Director of Office of Management and Budget</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget shall coordinate and monitor the development and implementation by Federal departments and agencies of the efforts required by subsection (b) of this section and shall report to the Congress on such development and implementation and with respect to any provisions of law which unnecessarily prevent such departments and agencies from carrying out the provisions of this section as part of each report required under Public Law 93&ndash;556.
