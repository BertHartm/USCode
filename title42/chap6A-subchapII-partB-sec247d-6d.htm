<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Scope of claims for loss</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Loss</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) physical, mental, or emotional injury, illness, disability, or condition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) fear of physical, mental, or emotional injury, illness, disability, or condition, including any need for medical monitoring; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) loss of or damage to property, including business interruption loss.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Each of clauses (i) through (iv) applies without regard to the date of the occurrence, presentation, or discovery of the loss described in the clause.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The immunity under paragraph (1) applies to any claim for loss that has a causal relationship with the administration to or use by an individual of a covered countermeasure, including a causal relationship with the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, manufacture, labeling, distribution, formulation, packaging, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, prescribing, administration, licensing, or use of such countermeasure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Certain conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to the other provisions of this section, immunity under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered countermeasure applies only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the countermeasure was administered or used for the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health specified in the declaration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in addition, in the case of a covered person who is a program planner or qualified person with respect to the administration or use of the countermeasure, the countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was in a population specified by the declaration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) was at the time of administration physically present in a geographic area <!-- PDFPage:216 -->specified by the declaration or had a connection to such area specified in the declaration.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Applicability of certain conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to immunity under paragraph (1) and subject to the other provisions of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the case of a covered person who is a manufacturer or distributor of the covered countermeasure involved, the immunity applies without regard to whether such countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual in accordance with the conditions described in paragraph (3)(C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the case of a covered person who is a program planner or qualified person with respect to the administration or use of the covered countermeasure, the scope of immunity includes circumstances in which the countermeasure was administered to or used by an individual in circumstances in which the covered person reasonably could have believed that the countermeasure was administered or used in accordance with the conditions described in paragraph (3)(C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Effect of distribution method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of this section apply to a covered countermeasure regardless of whether such countermeasure is obtained by donation, commercial sale, or any other means of distribution, except to the extent that, under paragraph (2)(E) of subsection (b) of this section, the declaration under such subsection provides that subsection (a) of this section applies only to covered countermeasures obtained through a particular means of distribution.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Rebuttable presumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), there shall be a rebuttable presumption that any administration or use, during the effective period of the emergency declaration by the Secretary under subsection (b) of this section, of a covered countermeasure shall have been for the category or categories of diseases, health conditions, or threats to health with respect to which such declaration was issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Declaration by Secretary</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority to issue declaration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), if the Secretary makes a determination that a disease or other health condition or other threat to health constitutes a public health emergency, or that there is a credible risk that the disease, condition, or threat may in the future constitute such an emergency, the Secretary may make a declaration, through publication in the Federal Register, recommending, under conditions as the Secretary may specify, the manufacture, testing, development, distribution, administration, or use of one or more covered countermeasures, and stating that subsection (a) of this section is in effect with respect to the activities so recommended.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In issuing a declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall identify, for each covered countermeasure specified in the declaration&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the geographic area or areas for which subsection (a) of this section is in effect with respect to the administration or use of the countermeasure (which may be a specification that such subsection applies without geographic limitation), including, with respect to individuals in the populations identified under subparagraph (C), a specification, as determined appropriate by the Secretary, of whether the declaration applies only to individuals physically present in such areas or whether in addition the declaration applies to individuals who have a connection to such areas, which connection is described in the declaration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) whether subsection (a) of this section is effective only to a particular means of distribution as provided in subsection (a)(5) of this section for obtaining the countermeasure, and if so, the particular means to which such subsection is effective.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Effective period of declaration</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Flexibility of period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may, in describing periods under paragraph (2)(B), have different periods for different covered persons to address different logistical, practical or other differences in responsibilities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Additional time to be specified</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In each declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary, after consulting, to the extent the Secretary deems appropriate, with the manufacturer of the covered countermeasure, shall also specify a date that is after the ending date specified under paragraph (2)(B) and that allows what the Secretary determines is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a reasonable period for the manufacturer to arrange for disposition of the covered countermeasure, including the return of such product to the manufacturer; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a reasonable period for covered persons to take such other actions as may be appropriate to limit administration or use of the covered countermeasure.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Additional period for certain strategic national stockpile countermeasures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to a covered countermeasure that is in the stockpile under section 247d&ndash;6b of this title, if such countermeasure was the subject of a declaration under paragraph (1) <!-- PDFPage:217 -->at the time that it was obtained for the stockpile, the effective period of such declaration shall include a period when the countermeasure is administered or used pursuant to a distribution or release from the stockpile.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Amendments to declaration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may through publication in the Federal Register amend any portion of a declaration under paragraph (1). Such an amendment shall not retroactively limit the applicability of subsection (a) of this section with respect to the administration or use of the covered countermeasure involved.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Certain disclosures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In publishing a declaration under paragraph (1) in the Federal Register, the Secretary is not required to disclose any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Factors to be considered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In deciding whether and under what circumstances or conditions to issue a declaration under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered countermeasure, the Secretary shall consider the desirability of encouraging the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, manufacture, labeling, distribution, formulation, packaging, marketing, promotion, sale, purchase, donation, dispensing, prescribing, administration, licensing, and use of such countermeasure.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Judicial review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No court of the United States, or of any State, shall have subject matter jurisdiction to review, whether by mandamus or otherwise, any action by the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Preemption of State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">During the effective period of a declaration under subsection (b) of this section, or at any time with respect to conduct undertaken in accordance with such declaration, no State or political subdivision of a State may establish, enforce, or continue in effect with respect to a covered countermeasure any provision of law or legal requirement that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) is different from, or is in conflict with, any requirement applicable under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) relates to the design, development, clinical testing or investigation, formulation, manufacture, distribution, sale, donation, purchase, marketing, promotion, packaging, labeling, licensing, use, any other aspect of safety or efficacy, or the prescribing, dispensing, or administration by qualified persons of the covered countermeasure, or to any matter included in a requirement applicable to the covered countermeasure under this section or any other provision of this chapter, or under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act [21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Within 30 days after making a declaration under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report that provides an explanation of the reasons for issuing the declaration and the reasons underlying the determinations of the Secretary with respect to paragraph (2).

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) in disregard of a known or obvious risk that is so great as to make it highly probable that the harm will outweigh the benefit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The criterion stated in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as establishing a standard for liability that is more stringent than a standard of negligence in any form or recklessness.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary, in consultation with the Attorney General, shall promulgate regulations, which may be promulgated through interim final rules, that further restrict the scope of actions or omissions by a covered person that may qualify as &ldquo;willful misconduct&rdquo; for purposes of subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors to be considered</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a program planner or qualified person shall not have engaged in &ldquo;willful misconduct&rdquo; as a matter of law where such program planner or qualified person acted consistent with applicable directions, guidelines, or recommendations by the Secretary regarding the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is specified in the declaration under subsection (b) of this section, provided either the Secretary, or a State or local health authority, was provided with notice of information regarding serious physical injury or death from the administration or use of a covered countermeasure that is material to the plaintiff's alleged loss within 7 days of the actual discovery of such information by such program planner or qualified person.</p>
