<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Allotments for States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes described in subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and in consultation with the Administrator of the Health Resources and Services Administration, shall for each of the fiscal years 1991 through 1995 make an allotment for each State in an amount determined in accordance with section 300ff&ndash;49 of this title. The Secretary shall make payments, as grants, to each State from the allotment for the State for the fiscal year involved if the Secretary approves for the fiscal year an application submitted by the State pursuant to section 300ff&ndash;65 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes of grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may not make a grant under subsection (a) of this section unless the State involved agrees to expend the grant for the purposes of providing, on an outpatient basis, each of the early intervention services specified in paragraph (2) with respect to HIV disease.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Specification of early intervention services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The early intervention services referred to in paragraph (1) are&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) referrals described in paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) other clinical and diagnostic services with respect to HIV disease, and periodic medical evaluations of individuals with the disease; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may expend the grant to provide outreach services to individuals who may have HIV disease, or may be at risk of the disease, and who may be unaware of the availability and potential benefits of early treatment of the disease, and to provide outreach services to health care professionals who may be unaware of such availability and potential benefits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may, in the case of individuals who seek early intervention services from the grantee, expend the grant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for case management to provide coordination in the provision of health care services to the individuals and to review the extent of utilization of the services by the individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to provide assistance to the individuals regarding establishing the eligibility of the individuals for financial assistance and services under Federal, State, or local programs providing for health services, mental health services, social services, or other appropriate services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any State to which the criterion described in subsection (c) of this section applies, the Secretary may not make a grant under section 300ff&ndash;41 of this title unless the State agrees that, with respect to the costs to be incurred by the State in carrying out the purpose referred to in such subsection, the State will, subject to subsection (b)(2) of this section, make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount equal to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for any subsequent fiscal year, not less than 331/3 percent of such costs ($1 for each $2 of Federal funds provided in the grant).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Determination of amount of non-Federal contribution</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Non-Federal contributions required in subsection (a) of this section may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. Amounts provided by the Federal Government, and any portion of any service subsidized by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Inclusion of certain amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In making a determination of the amount of non-Federal contributions made by a State for purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall, subject to subparagraph (B), include any non-Federal contributions provided by the State for HIV-related services, without regard to whether the contributions are made for programs established pursuant to this subchapter.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applicability of matching requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Percentage of national number of cases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The criterion referred to in subsection (a) of this section is, with respect to a State, that the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome reported to and confirmed by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the State for the period described in subparagraph (B) constitutes more than 1 percent of the number of such cases reported to and confirmed by the Director for the United States for such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The period referred to in subparagraph (A) is the 2-year period preceding the fiscal year for which the State involved is applying to receive a grant under section 300ff&ndash;41 of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the number of cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome reported and confirmed for the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico for any fiscal year shall be deemed to be less than 1 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Diminished State contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to a State that does not make available the entire amount of the non-Federal contribution referred to in subsection (a) of this section, the State shall continue to be eligible to receive Federal funds under a grant under section 300ff&ndash;41 of this title, except that the Secretary in providing Federal funds under the grant shall provide such funds (in accordance with the ratios prescribed in paragraph (1)) only with respect to the amount of funds contributed by such State.</p>
