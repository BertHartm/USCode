<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) suspend or cancel the designation of an accrediting entity found to be substantially out of compliance with the Convention, this chapter, other applicable laws, or implementing regulations under this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Suspension or cancellation of accreditation or approval</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Secretary's authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall suspend or cancel the accreditation or approval granted by an accrediting entity to an agency or person pursuant to section 14922 of this title when the Secretary finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the agency or person is substantially out of compliance with applicable requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the accrediting entity has failed or refused, after consultation with the Secretary, to take appropriate enforcement action.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Correction of deficiency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At any time when the Secretary is satisfied that the deficiencies on the basis of which an adverse action is taken under paragraph (1) have been corrected, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) there has been a pattern of serious, willful, or grossly negligent failures to comply or other aggravating circumstances indicating that continued accreditation or approval would not be in the best interests of the children and families concerned.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Period of debarment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary's debarment order shall state whether the debarment is temporary or permanent.

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to comply with certain requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A failure to comply with the requirements of section 14923(b)(1)(A)(ii) of this title shall constitute a serious failure to comply under subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section unless it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that such noncompliance had neither the purpose nor the effect of determining the outcome of a decision or proceeding by a court or other competent authority in the United States or the child's country of origin.</p>
