<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All test procedures and related determinations prescribed or made by the Secretary with respect to any covered product (or class thereof) which are in effect on March 17, 1987, shall remain in effect until the Secretary amends such test procedures and related determinations under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Amended and new procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary may amend test procedures with respect to any covered product if the Secretary determines that amended test procedures would more accurately or fully comply with the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may, in accordance with the requirements of this subsection, prescribe test procedures for any consumer product classified as a covered product under section 6292(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall direct the National Institute of Standards and Technology to assist in developing new or amended test procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines, on his own behalf or in response to a petition by any interested person, that a test procedure should be prescribed or amended, the Secretary shall promptly publish in the Federal Register proposed test procedures and afford interested persons an opportunity to present oral and written data, views, and arguments with respect to such procedures. The comment period shall not be less than 60 days and may be extended for good cause shown to not more than 270 days. In prescribing or amending a test procedure, the Secretary shall take into account such information as the Secretary determines relevant to such procedure, including technological developments relating to energy use or energy efficiency of the type (or class) of covered products involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any test procedures prescribed or amended under this section shall be reasonably designed to produce test results which measure energy efficiency, energy use, water use (in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets and urinals), or estimated annual operating cost of a covered product during a representative average use cycle or period of use, as determined by the Secretary, and shall not be unduly burdensome to conduct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the test procedure is a procedure for determining estimated annual operating costs, such procedure shall provide that such costs shall be calculated from measurements of energy use or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water use in a representative average use cycle or period of use, as determined by the Secretary, and from representative average unit costs of the energy needed to operate such product during such cycle, or in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, representative average unit costs of water and wastewater treatment service resulting from the operation of such products during such cycle. The Secretary shall provide information to manufacturers with respect to representative average unit costs of energy, water, and wastewater treatment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) With respect to fluorescent lamp ballasts manufactured on or after January 1, 1990, and to which standards are applicable under section 6295 of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe test procedures that are in accord with ANSI standard C82.2&ndash;1984 or other test procedures determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) With respect to fluorescent lamps and incandescent reflector lamps to which standards are applicable under subsection (i) of section 6295 of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe test procedures, to be carried out by accredited test laboratories, that take into consideration the applicable IES or ANSI standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) Test procedures for showerheads and faucets to which standards are applicable under subsection (j) of section 6295 of this title shall be the test procedures specified in ASME A112.18.1M&ndash;1989 for such products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the test procedure requirements of ASME A112.18.1M&ndash;1989 are revised at any time and approved by ANSI, the Secretary shall amend the test procedures established by subparagraph (A) to conform to such revised ASME/ANSI requirements unless the Secretary determines, by rule, that to do so would not meet the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8)(A) Test procedures for water closets and urinals to which standards are applicable under subsection (k) of section 6295 of this title shall be the test procedures specified in ASME A112.19.6&ndash;1990 for such products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the test procedure requirements of ASME A112.19.6&ndash;1990 are revised at any time and approved by ANSI, the Secretary shall amend the test procedures established by subparagraph (A) to conform to such revised ASME/ANSI requirements unless the Secretary determines, by rule, that to do so would not meet the requirements of paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Restriction on certain representations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler may make any representation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in writing (including a representation on a label); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any broadcast advertisement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">with respect to the energy use or efficiency or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, and urinals, water use of a covered product to which a test procedure is applicable under subsection (a) of this section or the cost of energy consumed by such product, unless such product has been tested in accordance with such test procedure and such representation fairly discloses the results of such testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Effective 180 days after an amended or new test procedure applicable to a covered product is prescribed or established under subsection (b) of this section, no manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler may make any representation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in writing (including a representation on a label); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any broadcast advertisement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">with respect to energy use or efficiency or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, and urinals, water use of such product or cost of energy consumed by such product, unless such product has been tested in accordance with such <!-- PDFPage:4104 -->amended or new test procedures and such representation fairly discloses the results of such testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the petition of any manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler, filed not later than the 60th day before the expiration of the period involved, the 180-day period referred to in paragraph (2) may be extended by the Secretary with respect to the petitioner (but in no event for more than an additional 180 days) if the Secretary determines that the requirements of paragraph (2) would impose an undue hardship on such petitioner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Case in which test procedure is not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is not required to publish and prescribe test procedures for a covered product (or class thereof) if the Secretary determines, by rule, that test procedures cannot be developed which meet the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section and publishes such determination in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of section 6297 of this title, a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to any covered product or class shall have the same effect as would a standard prescribed for a covered product (or class).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amendment of standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any amended test procedure which is prescribed pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall determine, in the rulemaking carried out with respect to prescribing such procedure, to what extent, if any, the proposed test procedure would alter the measured energy efficiency, measured energy use, or measured water use of any covered product as determined under the existing test procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines that the amended test procedure will alter the measured efficiency or measured use, the Secretary shall amend the applicable energy conservation standard during the rulemaking carried out with respect to such test procedure. In determining the amended energy conservation standard, the Secretary shall measure, pursuant to the amended test procedure, the energy efficiency, energy use, or water use of a representative sample of covered products that minimally comply with the existing standard. The average of such energy efficiency, energy use, or water use levels determined under the amended test procedure shall constitute the amended energy conservation standard for the applicable covered products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Models of covered products in use before the date on which the amended energy conservation standard becomes effective (or revisions of such models that come into use after such date and have the same energy efficiency, energy use, or water use characteristics) that comply with the energy conservation standard applicable to such covered products on the day before such date shall be deemed to comply with the amended energy conservation standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary's authority to amend energy conservation standards under this subsection shall not affect the Secretary's obligation to issue final rules as described in section 6295 of this title.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Study of certain products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, shall study consumer products for which labeling rules under this section have not been proposed, in order to determine (1) the aggregate energy consumption of such products, and (2) whether the imposition of labeling requirements under this section would be feasible and useful to consumers in making purchasing decisions. The Secretary shall include the results of such study in the annual report under section 6308 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Commission shall consult with each other on a continuing basis as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out their respective responsibilities under this part. Before the Commission makes any determination under subsection (a)(1) of this section, it shall obtain the views of the Secretary and shall take such views into account in making such determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is not consistent with the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) As part of the rulemaking conducted under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall also determine if adoption of a uniform national standard for any type or class of low consumption water closet or low consumption urinal more stringent than such amended ASME/ANSI Standard A112.19.6 for such product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) would result in additional conservation of energy or water;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) would be technologically feasible and economically justified under subsection (<em>o</em>) of this section; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary makes an affirmative determination under clause (i), the final rule published under subparagraph (A) shall waive the provisions of section 6297(c) of this title with respect to any State regulation concerning the water use or water efficiency of such type or class of low consumption water closet or low consumption urinal if such State regulation&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) is more stringent than amended ASME/ANSI Standard A112.19.6 for such type or class of low consumption water closet or low consumption urinal and the standard in effect for such product on the day before the date on which a final rule is published under subparagraph (A); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Standards for other covered products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may prescribe an energy conservation standard for any type (or class) of covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19) of section 6292(a) of this title if the requirements of subsections (<em>o</em>) and (p) of this section are met and the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the average per household energy use within the United States by products of such type (or class) exceeded 150 kilowatt-hours (or its Btu equivalent) for any 12-month period ending before such determination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the aggregate household energy use within the United States by products of such type (or class) exceeded 4,200,000,000 kilowatt-hours (or its Btu equivalent) for any such 12-month period;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) substantial improvement in the energy efficiency of products of such type (or class) is technologically feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the application of a labeling rule under section 6294 of this title to such type (or class) is not likely to be sufficient to induce manufacturers to produce, and consumers and other persons to purchase, covered products of such type (or class) which achieve the maximum energy efficiency which is technologically feasible and economically justified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any new or amended standard for covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19) of section 6292(a) of this title shall not apply to products manufactured within five years after the publication of a final rule establishing such standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may, in accordance with subsections (<em>o</em>) and (p) of this section, prescribe an energy conservation standard for television sets. Any such standard may not become effective with respect to products manufactured before January 1, 1992.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Further rulemaking</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After issuance of the last final rules required under subsections (b) through (i) of this section, the Secretary may publish final rules to determine whether standards for a covered product should be amended. An amendment prescribed under this subsection shall apply to products manufactured after a date which is 5 years after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effective date of the previous amendment made pursuant to this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the previous final rule published under this part did not amend the standard, the earliest date by which a previous amendment could have been in effect, except that in no case may an amended standard apply to products manufactured within 3 years (for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, and kitchen ranges and ovens) or 5 years (for central air conditioners and heat pumps, water heaters, pool heaters, direct heating equipment and furnaces) after publication of the final rule establishing a standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Petition for amended standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to each covered product described in paragraphs (1) through (11), and in paragraphs (13) and (14) of section 6292(a) of this title, any person may petition the Secretary to conduct a rulemaking to determine for a covered product if the standards contained either in the last final rule required under subsections (b) through (i) of this section or in a final rule published under this section should be amended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall grant a petition if he finds that it contains evidence which, assuming no other evidence were considered, provides an adequate basis for amending the standards under the following criteria&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) amended standards will result in significant conservation of energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) amended standards are technologically feasible; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) amended standards are cost effective as described in subsection (<em>o</em>)(2)(B)(i)(II) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The grant of a petition by the Secretary under this subsection creates no presumption with respect to the Secretary's determination of any of the criteria in a rulemaking under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An amendment prescribed under this subsection shall apply to products manufactured after a date which is 5 years after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the effective date of the previous amendment pursuant to this part; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the previous final rule published under this part did not amend the standard, the earliest date by which a previous amendment could have been in effect, except that in no case may an amended standard apply to products manufactured within 3 years (for refrigerators, refrigerator-freezers, and freezers, room air conditioners, dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, fluorescent lamp ballasts, general service fluorescent lamps, incandescent reflector lamps, and kitchen ranges and ovens) or 5 years (for central air conditioners and heat pumps, water heaters, pool heaters, direct heating equipment and furnaces) after publication of the final rule establishing a standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Criteria for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may not prescribe any amended standard which increases the maximum allowable energy use, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water use, or decreases the minimum required energy efficiency, of a covered product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed by the Secretary under <!-- PDFPage:4115 -->this section for any type (or class) of covered product shall be designed to achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency, or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water efficiency, which the Secretary determines is technologically feasible and economically justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In determining whether a standard is economically justified, the Secretary shall, after receiving views and comments furnished with respect to the proposed standard, determine whether the benefits of the standard exceed its burdens by, to the greatest extent practicable, considering&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the economic impact of the standard on the manufacturers and on the consumers of the products subject to such standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the savings in operating costs throughout the estimated average life of the covered product in the type (or class) compared to any increase in the price of, or in the initial charges for, or maintenance expenses of, the covered products which are likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the total projected amount of energy, or as applicable, water, savings likely to result directly from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) any lessening of the utility or the performance of the covered products likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) the impact of any lessening of competition, as determined in writing by the Attorney General, that is likely to result from the imposition of the standard;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VI) the need for national energy and water conservation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(VII) other factors the Secretary considers relevant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i)(V), the Attorney General shall make a determination of the impact, if any, of any lessening of competition likely to result from such standard and shall transmit such determination, not later than 60 days after the publication of a proposed rule prescribing or amending an energy conservation standard, in writing to the Secretary, together with an analysis of the nature and extent of such impact. Any such determination and analysis shall be published by the Secretary in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) If the Secretary finds that the additional cost to the consumer of purchasing a product complying with an energy conservation standard level will be less than three times the value of the energy, and as applicable, water, savings during the first year that the consumer will receive as a result of the standard, as calculated under the applicable test procedure, there shall be a rebuttable presumption that such standard level is economically justified. A determination by the Secretary that such criterion is not met shall not be taken into consideration in the Secretary's determination of whether a standard is economically justified.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section for a type (or class) of covered product if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) for products other than dishwashers, clothes washers, clothes dryers, and kitchen ranges and ovens, a test procedure has not been prescribed pursuant to section 6293 of this title with respect to that type (or class) of product; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary determines, by rule, that the establishment of such standard will not result in significant conservation of energy or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, or urinals, water, or that the establishment of such standard is not technologically feasible or economically justified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of section 6297 of this title, a determination under subparagraph (B) with respect to any type (or class) of covered products shall have the same effect as would a standard prescribed for such type (or class).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not prescribe an amended or new standard under this section if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established by a preponderance of the evidence that the standard is likely to result in the unavailability in the United States in any covered product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the United States at the time of the Secretary's finding. The failure of some types (or classes) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a standard for other types (or classes).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Procedure for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard shall be prescribed in accordance with the following procedure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall publish an advance notice of proposed rulemaking which specifies the type (or class) of covered products to which the rule may apply;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall invite interested persons to submit, within 60 days after the date of publication of such advance notice, written presentations of data, views, and arguments in response to such notice; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may identify proposed or amended standards that may be prescribed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A proposed rule which prescribes an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribes no amendment or no new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published in the Federal Register. In prescribing any such proposed rule with respect to a standard, the Secretary shall determine the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible for each type (or class) of covered products. If such standard is not designed to achieve such efficiency or use, the Secretary shall state in the proposed rule the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) After the publication of such proposed rulemaking, the Secretary shall, in accordance with section 6306 of this title, afford interested persons an opportunity, during a period of not less than 60 days, to present oral and written comments (including an opportunity to question those who make such presentations, as provided in such section) on mat<!-- PDFPage:4116 -->ters relating to such proposed rule, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the standard to be prescribed is economically justified (taking into account those factors which the Secretary must consider under subsection (<em>o</em>)(2) of this section) or will result in the effects described in subsection (<em>o</em>)(4) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the standard will achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which is technologically feasible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the standard will not achieve such improvement, whether the reasons for not achieving such improvement are adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether such rule should prescribe a level of energy use or efficiency which is higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply in the case of any group of products within the type (or class) that will be subject to such standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) A final rule prescribing an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribing no amended or new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published as soon as is practicable, but not less than 90 days, after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Special rule for certain types or classes of products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A rule prescribing an energy conservation standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall specify a level of energy use or efficiency higher or lower than that which applies (or would apply) for such type (or class) for any group of covered products which have the same function or intended use, if the Secretary determines that covered products within such group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered products within such type (or class); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have a capacity or other performance-related feature which other products within such type (or class) do not have and such feature justifies a higher or lower standard from that which applies (or will apply) to other products within such type (or class).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under this paragraph concerning whether a performance-related feature justifies the establishment of a higher or lower standard, the Secretary shall consider such factors as the utility to the consumer of such a feature, and such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any rule prescribing a higher or lower level of energy use or efficiency under paragraph (1) shall include an explanation of the basis on which such higher or lower level was established.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Inclusion in standards of test procedures and other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed under this section shall include, where applicable, test procedures prescribed in accordance with section 6293 of this title and may include any requirement which the Secretary determines is necessary to assure that each covered product to which such standard applies meets the required minimum level of energy efficiency or maximum quantity of energy use specified in such standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Determination of compliance with standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Compliance with, and performance under, the energy conservation standards (except for design standards authorized by this part) established in, or prescribed under, this section shall be determined using the test procedures and corresponding compliance criteria prescribed under section 6293 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Small manufacturer exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may, on application of any manufacturer, exempt such manufacturer from all or part of the requirements of any energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under this section for any period not longer than the 24-month period beginning on the date such rule becomes effective, if the Secretary finds that the annual gross revenues of such manufacturer from all its operations (including the manufacture and sale of covered products) does not exceed $8,000,000 for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application. In making such finding with respect to any manufacturer, the Secretary shall take into account the annual gross revenues of any other person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such manufacturer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not exercise the authority granted under paragraph (1) with respect to any type (or class) of covered product subject to an energy conservation standard under this section unless the Secretary makes a finding, after obtaining the written views of the Attorney General, that a failure to allow an exemption under paragraph (1) would likely result in a lessening of competition.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (5), the Secretary shall, within the period described in paragraph (2) and after consideration of the petition and the comments of interested persons, prescribe such rule if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that the State or river basin commission has established by a preponderance of the evidence that such State regulation is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy or water interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;unusual and compelling State or local energy or water interests&rdquo; means interests which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) are substantially different in nature or magnitude than those prevailing in the United States generally; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) are such that the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy or water savings resulting from the State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of alternative approaches to energy or water savings or production, including reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in efficiency of all products subject to the State regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The factors described in clause (ii) shall be evaluated within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, and, with respect to a State regulation for which a petition has been submitted to the Secretary which provides for any energy conservation standard or requirement with respect to water use of a covered product, within the context of the water supply and groundwater management plan, water quality program, and comprehensive plan (if any) of the State or river basin commission for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway affected by water supply development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall give notice of any petition filed under paragraph (1)(A) and afford interested persons a reasonable opportunity to make written comments, including rebuttal comments, thereon. The Secretary shall, within the 6-month period beginning on the date on which any such petition is filed, deny such petition or prescribe the requested rule, except that the Secretary may publish a notice in the Federal Register extending such period to a date certain but no longer than one year after the date on which the petition was filed. Such notice shall include the reasons for delay. In the case of any denial of a petition under this subsection, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of, and the reasons for, such denial.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may not prescribe a rule under this subsection if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such State regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sale, or servicing of the covered product on a national basis. In determining whether to make such finding, the Secretary shall evaluate all relevant factors, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the extent to which the State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of manufacturers, distributors, and others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the extent to which the State regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered product in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered product type (or class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation would result in a reduction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the current models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the current or projected sales volume of the covered product type (or class) in the State and the United States; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the extent to which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State appliance efficiency requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not prescribe a rule under this subsection if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the State regulation is likely to result in the unavailability in the State of any covered product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding, except that the failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for other classes (or types).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No final rule prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) permit any State regulation to become effective with respect to any covered product manufactured within three years after such rule is published in the Federal Register or <!-- PDFPage:4121 -->within five years if the Secretary finds that such additional time is necessary due to the substantial burdens of retooling, redesign, or distribution needed to comply with the State regulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) become effective with respect to a covered product manufactured before the earliest possible effective date specified in section 6295 of this title for the initial amendment of the energy conservation standard established in such section for the covered product; except that such rule may become effective before such date if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that, in addition to the other requirements of this subsection the State has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) there exists within the State an energy emergency condition or, if the State regulation provides for an energy conservation standard or other requirement with respect to the water use of a covered product for which there is a Federal energy conservation standard under subsection (j) or (k) of section 6295 of this title, a water emergency condition, which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) imperils the health, safety, and welfare of its residents because of the inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate quantities of gas or electric energy or, in the case of a water emergency condition, water or wastewater treatment, to its residents at less than prohibitive costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) cannot be substantially alleviated by the importation of energy or, in the case of a water emergency condition, by the importation of water, or by the use of interconnection agreements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the State regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any case in which a State is issued a rule under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered product and subsequently a Federal energy conservation standard concerning such product is amended pursuant to section 6295 of this title, any person subject to such State regulation may file a petition with the Secretary requesting the Secretary to withdraw the rule issued under paragraph (1) with respect to such product in such State. The Secretary shall consider such petition in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (3), and (4), except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the rule received by the State under paragraph (1) should be withdrawn as a result of the amendment to the Federal standard. If the Secretary determines that the petitioner has shown that the rule issued by the State should be so withdrawn, the Secretary shall withdraw it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception for certain State procurement standards</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Exception for certain building code requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A regulation or other requirement enacted or prescribed before January 8, 1987, that is contained in a State or local building code for new construction concerning the energy efficiency or energy use of a covered product is not superseded by this part until the effective date of the energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title for such covered product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A regulation or other requirement, or revision thereof, enacted or prescribed on or after January 8, 1987, that is contained in a State or local building code for new construction concerning the energy efficiency or energy use of a covered product is not superseded by this part until the effective date of the energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title for such covered product if the code does not require that the energy efficiency of such covered product exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the applicable minimum efficiency requirement in a national voluntary consensus standard; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the minimum energy efficiency level in a regulation or other requirement of the State meeting the requirements of subsection (b)(1) or (b)(5) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">whichever is higher.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Effective on the effective date of an energy conservation standard for a covered product established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title, a regulation or other requirement contained in a State or local building code for new construction concerning the energy efficiency or energy use of such covered product is not superseded by this part if the code complies with all of the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The code permits a builder to meet an energy consumption or conservation objective for a building by selecting items whose combined energy efficiencies meet the objective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The code does not require that the covered product have an energy efficiency exceeding the applicable energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title, except that the required efficiency may exceed such standard up to the level required by a regulation of that State for which the Secretary has issued a rule granting a waiver under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The credit to the energy consumption or conservation objective allowed by the code for installing covered products having energy efficiencies exceeding such energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title or the efficiency level required in a State regulation referred to in subparagraph (B) is on a one-for-one equivalent energy use or equivalent cost basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If the code uses one or more baseline building designs against which all submitted building designs are to be evaluated and such baseline building designs contain a covered product subject to an energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title, the baseline building designs are based on the efficiency level for such covered product which meets but does <!-- PDFPage:4122 -->not exceed such standard or the efficiency level required by a regulation of that State for which the Secretary has issued a rule granting a waiver under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) If the code sets forth one or more optional combinations of items which meet the energy consumption or conservation objective, for every combination which includes a covered product the efficiency of which exceeds either standard or level referred to in subparagraph (D), there also shall be at least one combination which includes such covered product the efficiency of which does not exceed such standard or level by more than 5 percent, except that at least one combination shall include such covered product the efficiency of which meets but does not exceed such standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) The energy consumption or conservation objective is specified in terms of an estimated total consumption of energy (which may be calculated from energy loss- or gain-based codes) utilizing an equivalent amount of energy (which may be specified in units of energy or its equivalent cost).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) The estimated energy use of any covered product permitted or required in the code, or used in calculating the objective, is determined using the applicable test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title, except that the State may permit the estimated energy use calculation to be adjusted to reflect the conditions of the areas where the code is being applied if such adjustment is based on the use of the applicable test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title or other technically accurate documented procedure.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Subject to subparagraph (B), a State or local government is not required to submit a petition to the Secretary in order to enforce or apply its building code or to establish that the code meets the conditions set forth in this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If a building code requires the installation of covered products with efficiencies exceeding both the applicable Federal standard established in or prescribed under section 6295 of this title and the applicable standard of such State, if any, that has been granted a waiver under subsection (d) of this section, such requirement of the building code shall not be applicable unless the Secretary has granted a waiver for such requirement under subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) No warranty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any disclosure with respect to energy use, energy efficiency, or estimated annual operating cost which is required to be made under the provisions of this part shall not create an express or implied warranty under State or Federal law that such energy efficiency will be achieved or that such energy use or estimated annual operating cost will not be exceeded under conditions of actual use.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, any person who knowingly violates any provision of section 6302 of this title shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $100 for each violation. Such penalties shall be assessed by the Commission, except that penalties for violations of section 6302(a)(3) of this title which relate to requirements prescribed by the Secretary, violations of section 6302(a)(4) of this title which relate to requests of the Secretary under section 6296(b)(2) of this title, or violations of section 6302(a)(5) of this title shall be assessed by the Secretary. Civil penalties assessed under this part may be compromised by the agency or officer authorized to assess the penalty, taking into account the nature and degree of the violation and the impact of the penalty upon a particular respondent. Each violation of paragraph (1), (2), or (5) of section 6302(a) of this title shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each covered product, and each day of violation of section 6302(a)(3) or (4) of this title shall constitute a separate violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Knowingly&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in subsection (a) of this section, the term &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; means (1) the having of actual knowledge, or (2) the presumed having of knowledge deemed to be possessed by a reasonable man who acts in the circumstances, including knowledge obtainable upon the exercise of due care.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce (within the meaning of section 45(a)(1) of title 15) for any person to violate section 6293(c) of this title, except to the extent that such violation is prohibited under the provisions of section 6302(a)(1) of this title, in which case such provisions shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedure for assessing penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty against any person under this section, the Secretary shall provide to such person notice of the proposed penalty. Such notice shall inform such person of his opportunity to elect in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice to have the procedures of paragraph (3) (in lieu of those of paragraph (2)) apply with respect to such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Unless an election is made within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice under paragraph (1) to have paragraph (3) apply with respect to such penalty, the Secretary shall assess the penalty, by order, after a determination of violation has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant to section 554 of title 5 before an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. Such assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's findings and the basis for such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this paragraph may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the Secretary assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United States court of appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary, or the court may remand the proceeding to the Secretary for such further action as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the procedures of this paragraph have been elected, the Secretary shall promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of the notice under paragraph (1) of the proposed penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the civil penalty has not been paid within 60 calendar days after the assessment order <!-- PDFPage:4125 -->has been made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall institute an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for an order affirming the assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to review de novo the law and the facts involved, and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (2), or after the appropriate district court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall institute an action to recover the amount of such penalty in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of title 28 or section 7192(c) of this title, the Secretary shall be represented by the general counsel of the Department of Energy (or any attorney or attorneys within the Department of Energy designated by the Secretary) who shall supervise, conduct, and argue any civil litigation to which paragraph (3) of this subsection applies (including any related collection action under paragraph (4)) in a court of the United States or in any other court, except the Supreme Court. However, the Secretary or the general counsel shall consult with the Attorney General concerning such litigation, and the Attorney General shall provide, on request, such assistance in the conduct of such litigation as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to the provisions of section 7192(c) of this title, the Secretary shall be represented by the Attorney General, or the Solicitor General, as appropriate, in actions under this subsection, except to the extent provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Section 7172(d) of this title shall not apply with respect to the functions of the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of applying the preceding provisions of this subsection in the case of the assessment of a penalty by the Commission for a violation of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 6302 of this title, references in such provisions to &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Department of Energy&rdquo; shall be considered to be references to the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;.</p>
