<p class="note-body">Section 16272(d) of this title, referred to in subsec. (b)(1), was in the original a reference to section 942(d) of Pub. L. 109&ndash;58, which is classified to section 16251(d) of this title but was translated as meaning section 952(d) of Pub. L. 109&ndash;58 to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because section 952(d) relates to Generation IV Nuclear Energy Systems Initiative and section 942(d) relates to limitations on production incentives for cellulosic biofuels.</p>
