<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Unless an election is made within thirty calendar days after receipt of notice under paragraph (1) to have paragraph (3) apply with respect to such penalty, the Secretary shall assess the penalty, by order, after a determination of violation has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant to section 554 of title 5 before an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. Such assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's findings and the basis for such assessment.</p>

The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary, or the court may remand the proceeding to the Secretary for such further action as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the procedures of this paragraph have been elected, the Secretary shall promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the election under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the civil penalty has not been paid within sixty calendar days after the assessment <!-- PDFPage:4633 -->order has been made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall institute an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for an order affirming the assessment of the civil penalty.

In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation for not-for-profit institutions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, in the case of any not-for-profit contractor, subcontractor, or supplier, the total amount of civil penalties paid under subsection (a) of this section may not exceed the total amount of fees paid within any 1-year period (as determined by the Secretary) under the contract under which the violation occurs.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No effect on health and safety enforcement</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Maximum amount</h4>
