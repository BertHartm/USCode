<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Prescription by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary has prescribed test procedures under section 6314 of this title for any class of covered equipment, he shall prescribe a labeling rule applicable to such class of covered equipment in accordance with the following provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Disclosure of energy efficiency of articles of covered equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A labeling rule prescribed in accordance with this section shall require that each article of covered equipment which is in the type (or class) of industrial equipment to which such rule applies, discloses by label, the energy efficiency of such article, determined in accordance with test procedures under section 6314 of this title. Such rule may also require that such disclosure include the estimated operating costs and energy use, determined in accordance with test procedures under section 6314 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Inclusion of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A rule prescribed in accordance with this section shall include such requirements as the Secretary determines are likely to assist purchasers in making purchasing decisions, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) requirements and directions for display of any label,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) requirements for including on any label, or separately attaching to, or shipping with, the covered equipment, such additional information relating to energy efficiency, energy use, and other measures of energy consumption, including instructions for the maintenance, use, or repair of the covered equipment, as the Secretary determines necessary to provide adequate information to purchasers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) requirements that printed matter which is displayed or distributed at the point of sale of such equipment shall disclose such information as may be required under this section to be disclosed on the label of such equipment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Labeling rules applicable to electric motors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (h) of this section, not later than 12 months after the Secretary establishes test procedures for electric motors under section 6314 of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe labeling rules under this section applicable to electric motors taking into consideration NEMA Standards Publication MG1&ndash;1987. Such rules shall provide that the labeling of any electric motor manufactured after the 12-month period beginning on the date the Secretary prescribes such labeling rules, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) indicate the energy efficiency of the motor on the permanent nameplate attached to such motor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prominently display the energy efficiency of the motor in equipment catalogs and other material used to market the equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include such other markings as the Secretary determines necessary solely to facilitate enforcement of the standards established for electric motors under section 6313 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Labeling rules for air conditioning and heating equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (h) of this section, not later than 12 months after the Secretary establishes test procedures for small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, very large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers, automatic commercial ice makers, commercial clothes washers, walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers, packaged terminal air conditioners, packaged terminal heat pumps, warm-air furnaces, packaged boilers, storage water heaters, instantaneous water heaters, and unfired hot water storage tanks under section 6314 of this title, the Secretary shall prescribe labeling rules under this section for such equipment. Such rules shall provide that the labeling of any small commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, very large commercial package air conditioning and heating equipment, commercial refrigerators, freezers, and refrigerator-freezers, automatic commercial ice makers, commercial clothes washers, walk-in coolers and walk-in freezers, packaged terminal air conditioner, packaged terminal heat pump, warm-air furnace, packaged boiler, storage water heater, instantaneous water heater, and unfired hot water storage tank manufactured after the 12-month period beginning on the date the Secretary prescribes such rules shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) indicate the energy efficiency of the equipment on the permanent nameplate attached to such equipment or other nearby permanent marking;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) prominently display the energy efficiency of the equipment in new equipment catalogs used by the manufacturer to advertise the equipment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) include such other markings as the Secretary determines necessary solely to facilitate enforcement of the standards established for such equipment under section 6313 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consultation with Federal Trade Commission</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Restrictions on Secretary's authority to promulgate rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall not promulgate labeling rules for any class of industrial equipment unless he has determined that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) labeling in accordance with this section is technologically and economically feasible with respect to such class;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) significant energy savings will likely result from such labeling; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) labeling in accordance with this section is likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Tests for accuracy of information contained on labels</h4>
