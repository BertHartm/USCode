<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a State for which a balance from a grant award made pursuant to section 300ff&ndash;28(a)(1) or 300ff&ndash;28(a)(2)(F)(i) of this title is unobligated as of the end of the grant year for the award&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the Secretary shall reduce, by the same amount as such unobligated balance (less any amount of such balance that is the subject of a waiver of cancellation under paragraph (1)), the amount of the grant under such section for the first fiscal year beginning after the fiscal year in which the Secretary obtains the information necessary for determining that such balance was unobligated as of the end of the grant year (which requirement for a reduction applies without regard to whether a waiver under paragraph (1) has been approved with respect to such balance); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the grant funds involved in such reduction shall be made available by the Secretary as additional funds for grants under section 300ff&ndash;29a of this title for such first fiscal year, subject to section 300ff&ndash;28(a)(2)(H) of this title;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">except that this subparagraph does not apply to the State if the amount of the unobligated balance was 5 percent or less.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Relation to increases in grant</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A reduction under subparagraph (A) for a State for a fiscal year may not be taken into account in applying section 300ff&ndash;28(a)(2)(H) of this title with respect to the State for the subsequent fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Treatment of drug rebates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, funds that are drug rebates referred to in section 300ff&ndash;26(g) of this title may not be considered part of any grant award referred to in subsection (a). If an expenditure of ADAP rebate funds would trigger a penalty under this section or a higher penalty than would otherwise have applied, the State may request that for purposes of this section, the Secretary deem the State's unobligated balance to be reduced by the amount of rebate funds in the proposed expenditure. Notwithstanding 300ff&ndash;28(a)(2)(F)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300ff-31a_1_target" name="300ff-31a_1">1</a></sup> of this title, any unobligated amount under section 300ff&ndash;28(a)(2)(F)(ii)(V) of this title that is returned to the Secretary for reallocation shall be used by the Secretary for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the ADAP supplemental program if the Secretary determines appropriate; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for additional amounts for grants pursuant to section 300ff&ndash;29a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authority regarding administration of provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In administering subsections (b) and (c) with respect to the unobligated balance of a State, the Secretary may elect to reduce the amount of future grants to the State under section 300ff&ndash;28, 300ff&ndash;29a, or 300ff&ndash;30 of this title, as applicable, by the amount of any such unobligated balance in lieu of cancelling such amount as provided for in subsection (b) or (c)(1). In such case, the Secretary may permit the State to use such unobligated balance for purposes of any such future grant. An amount equal to such reduction shall be available for use as additional amounts for grants pursuant to section 300ff&ndash;29a of this title, subject to section 300ff&ndash;28(a)(2)(H) of this title. Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to affect the authority of the Secretary under subsections (b) and (c), including the authority to grant waivers under subsection (c)(1). The reduction in future grants authorized under this subsection shall be notwithstanding the penalty required under subsection (c)(4) with respect to unobligated funds.</p>
