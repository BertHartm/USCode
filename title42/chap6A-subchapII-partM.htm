<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Statewide cancer registries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, acting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control, may make grants to States, or may make grants or enter into contracts with academic or nonprofit organizations designated by the State to operate the State's cancer registry in lieu of making a grant directly to the State, to support the operation of population-based, statewide registries to collect, for each condition specified in paragraph (2)(A), data concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) demographic information about each case of cancer;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) information on the industrial or occupational history of the individuals with the cancers, to the extent such information is available from the same record;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) administrative information, including date of diagnosis and source of information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) pathological data characterizing the cancer, including the cancer site, stage of disease (pursuant to Staging Guide), incidence, and type of treatment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) other elements determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Cancer; benign brain-related tumors</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1), the conditions referred to in this paragraph are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Each form of in-situ and invasive cancer (with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinoma of the skin), including malignant brain-related tumors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Benign brain-related tumors.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Brain-related tumor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (A):</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The term &ldquo;brain-related tumor&rdquo; means a listed primary tumor (whether malignant or benign) occurring in any of the following sites:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) The brain, meninges, spinal cord, cauda equina, a cranial nerve or nerves, or any other part of the central nervous system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) The pituitary gland, pineal gland, or craniopharyngeal duct.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The term &ldquo;listed&rdquo;, with respect to a primary tumor, means a primary tumor that is listed in the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology (commonly referred to as the ICD&ndash;O).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) The term &ldquo;International Classification of Diseases for Oncology&rdquo; means a classification system that includes topography (site) information and histology (cell type information) developed by the World Health Organization, in collaboration with international centers, to promote international comparability in the collection, classification, processing, and presentation of cancer statistics. The ICD&ndash;O system is a supplement to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (commonly known as the ICD) and is the standard coding system used by cancer registries worldwide. Such term includes any modification made to such system for purposes of the United States. Such term further includes any published classification system that is internationally recognized as a successor to the classification system <!-- PDFPage:413 -->referred to in the first sentence of this clause.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Statewide cancer registry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">References in this section to cancer registries shall be considered to be references to registries described in this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Matching funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may make a grant under subsection (a) of this section only if the State, or the academic or nonprofit private organization designated by the State to operate the cancer registry of the State, involved agrees, with respect to the costs of the program, to make available (directly or through donations from public or private entities) non-Federal contributions toward such costs in an amount that is not less than 25 percent of such costs or $1 for every $3 of Federal funds provided in the grant.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of amount of non-Federal contribution; maintenance of effort</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Non-Federal contributions required in paragraph (1) may be in cash or in kind, fairly evaluated, including plant, equipment, or services. Amounts provided by the Federal Government, or services assisted or subsidized to any significant extent by the Federal Government, may not be included in determining the amount of such non-Federal contributions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) With respect to a State in which the purpose described in subsection (a) of this section is to be carried out, the Secretary, in making a determination of the amount of non-Federal contributions provided under paragraph (1), may include only such contributions as are in excess of the amount of such contributions made by the State toward the collection of data on cancer for the fiscal year preceding the first year for which a grant under subsection (a) of this section is made with respect to the State. The Secretary may decrease the amount of non-Federal contributions that otherwise would have been required by this subsection in those cases in which the State can demonstrate that decreasing such amount is appropriate because of financial hardship.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for grants</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">No grant shall be made by the Secretary under subsection (a) of this section unless an application has been submitted to, and approved by, the Secretary.

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) a means for the statewide cancer registry to access all records of physicians and surgeons, hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes, and all other facilities, individuals, or agencies providing such services to patients which would identify cases of cancer or would establish characteristics of the cancer, treatment of the cancer, or medical status of any identified patient;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) for the reporting of cancer case data to the statewide cancer registry in such a format, with such data elements, and in accordance with such standards of quality timeliness and completeness, as may be established by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) for the protection of the confidentiality of all cancer case data reported to the statewide cancer registry, including a prohibition on disclosure to any person of information reported to the statewide cancer registry that identifies, or could lead to the identification of, an individual cancer patient, except for disclosure to other State cancer registries and local and State health officers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) for a means by which confidential case data may in accordance with State law be disclosed to cancer researchers for the purposes of cancer prevention, control and research;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vii) for the authorization or the conduct, by the statewide cancer registry or other persons and organizations, of studies utilizing statewide cancer registry data, <!-- PDFPage:414 -->including studies of the sources and causes of cancer, evaluations of the cost, quality, efficacy, and appropriateness of diagnostic, therapeutic, rehabilitative, and preventative services and programs relating to cancer, and any other clinical, epidemiological, or other cancer research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(viii) for protection for individuals complying with the law, including provisions specifying that no person shall be held liable in any civil action with respect to a cancer case report provided to the statewide cancer registry, or with respect to access to cancer case information provided to the statewide cancer registry.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Relationship to certain programs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">This section may not be construed to act as a replacement for or diminishment of the program carried out by the Director of the National Cancer Institute and designated by such Director as the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program (SEER).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Supplanting of activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In areas where both such programs exist, the Secretary shall ensure that SEER support is not supplanted and that any additional activities are consistent with the guidelines provided for in subsection (c)(2)(C) and (D) of this section and are appropriately coordinated with the existing SEER program.</p>
