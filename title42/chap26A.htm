<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the vitality of the Nation and the quality of life of the citizens of the Nation depend increasingly on the understanding, assessment, development, and utilization of space resources;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the understanding and development of the space frontiers require a broad commitment and an intense involvement on the part of the Federal Government in partnership with State and local governments, private industry, universities, organizations, and individuals concerned with the exploration and utilization of space;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, through the national space grant college and fellowship program, offers the most suitable means for such commitment and involvement through the promotion of activities that will result in greater understanding, assessment, development, and utilization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Federal support of the establishment, development, and operation of programs and projects by space grant colleges, space grant regional consortia, institutions of higher education, institutes, laboratories, and other appropriate public and private entities is the most cost-effective way to promote such activities.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage and support the existence of interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary programs of space research within the university community of the Nation, to engage in integrated activities of training, research and public service, to have cooperative programs with industry, and to be coordinated with the overall program of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) encourage and support the existence of consortia, made up of university and industry members, to advance the exploration and development of space resources in cases in which national objectives can be better fulfilled than through the programs of single universities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) encourage and support Federal funding for graduate fellowships in fields related to space; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) support activities in colleges and universities generally for the purpose of creating and operating a network of institutional programs that will enhance achievements resulting from efforts under this chapter.</p>
