<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby finds that the imposition and application of the durational residency requirement as a precondition to voting for the offices of President and Vice President, and the lack of sufficient opportunities for absentee registration and absentee balloting in presidential elections&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) denies or abridges the inherent constitutional right of citizens to vote for their President and Vice President;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) denies or abridges the inherent constitutional right of citizens to enjoy their free movement across State lines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) denies or abridges the privileges and immunities guaranteed to the citizens of each State under article IV, section 2, clause 1, of the Constitution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in some instances has the impermissible purpose or effect of denying citizens the right to vote for such officers because of the way they may vote;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) has the effect of denying to citizens the equality of civil rights, and due process and equal protection of the laws that are guaranteed to them under the fourteenth amendment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) does not bear a reasonable relationship to any compelling State interest in the conduct of presidential elections.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional declaration: durational residency requirement, abolishment; absentee registration and balloting standards, establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the basis of these findings, Congress declares that in order to secure and protect the above-stated rights of citizens under the Constitution, to enable citizens to better obtain the enjoyment of such rights, and to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth amendment, it is necessary (1) to completely abolish the durational residency requirement as a precondition to voting for President and Vice President, and (2) to establish nationwide, uniform standards relative to absentee registration and absentee balloting in presidential elections.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4339 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibition of denial of right to vote because of durational residency requirement or absentee balloting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No citizen of the United States who is otherwise qualified to vote in any election for President and Vice President shall be denied the right to vote for electors for President and Vice President, or for President and Vice President, in such election because of the failure of such citizen to comply with any durational residency requirement of such State or political subdivision; nor shall any citizen of the United States be denied the right to vote for electors for President and Vice President, or for President and Vice President, in such election because of the failure of such citizen to be physically present in such State or political subdivision at the time of such election, if such citizen shall have complied with the requirements prescribed by the law of such State or political subdivision providing for the casting of absentee ballots in such election.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Registration: time for application; absentee balloting: time of application and return of ballots</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section, each State shall provide by law for the registration or other means of qualification of all duly qualified residents of such State who apply, not later than thirty days immediately prior to any presidential election, for registration or qualification to vote for the choice of electors for President and Vice President or for President and Vice President in such election; and each State shall provide by law for the casting of absentee ballots for the choice of electors for President and Vice President, or for President and Vice President, by all duly qualified residents of such State who may be absent from their election district or unit in such State on the day such election is held and who have applied therefor not later than seven days immediately prior to such election and have returned such ballots to the appropriate election official of such State not later than the time of closing of the polls in such State on the day of such election.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Change of residence; voting in person or by absentee ballot in State of prior residence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any citizen of the United States who is otherwise qualified to vote in any State or political subdivision in any election for President and Vice President has begun residence in such State or political subdivision after the thirtieth day next preceding such election and, for that reason, does not satisfy the registration requirements of such State or political subdivision he shall be allowed to vote for the choice of electors for President and Vice President, or for President and Vice President, in such election, (1) in person in the State or political subdivision in which he resided immediately prior to his removal if he had satisfied, as of the date of his change of residence, the requirements to vote in that State or political subdivision, or (2) by absentee ballot in the State or political subdivision in which he resided immediately prior to his removal if he satisfies, but for his nonresident status and the reason for his absence, the requirements for absentee voting in that State or political subdivision.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Absentee registration requirement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No citizen of the United States who is otherwise qualified to vote by absentee ballot in any State or political subdivision in any election for President and Vice President shall be denied the right to vote for the choice of electors for President and Vice President, or for President and Vice President, in such election because of any requirement of registration that does not include a provision for absentee registration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) State or local adoption of less restrictive voting practices</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this section shall prevent any State or political subdivision from adopting less restrictive voting practices than those that are prescribed herein.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &ldquo;State&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;State&rdquo; as used in this section includes each of the several States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) False registration, and other fraudulent acts and conspiracies: application of penalty for false information in registering or voting</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1973aa&ndash;1a. Bilingual election requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that, through the use of various practices and procedures, citizens of language minorities have been effectively excluded from participation in the electoral process. Among other factors, the denial of the right to vote of such minority group citizens is ordinarily directly related to the unequal educational opportunities afforded them resulting in high illiteracy and low voting participation. The Congress declares that, in order to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth and fifteenth amendments to the United States Constitution, it is necessary to eliminate such discrimination by prohibiting these practices, and by prescribing other remedial devices.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Bilingual voting materials requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before August 6, 2032, no covered State or political subdivision shall provide voting materials only in the English language.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Covered States and political subdivisions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Generally</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State or political subdivision is a covered State or political subdivision for the purposes of this subsection if the Director of the Census determines, based on the 2010 American Community Survey census data and subsequent American Community Survey data in 5-year increments, or comparable census data, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i)(I) more than 5 percent of the citizens of voting age of such State or political subdivision are members of a single lan<!-- PDFPage:4340 -->guage minority and are limited-English proficient;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) more than 10,000 of the citizens of voting age of such political subdivision are members of a single language minority and are limited-English proficient; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) in the case of a political subdivision that contains all or any part of an Indian reservation, more than 5 percent of the American Indian or Alaska Native citizens of voting age within the Indian reservation are members of a single language minority and are limited-English proficient; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the illiteracy rate of the citizens in the language minority as a group is higher than the national illiteracy rate.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The prohibitions of this subsection do not apply in any political subdivision that has less than 5 percent voting age limited-English proficient citizens of each language minority which comprises over 5 percent of the statewide limited-English proficient population of voting age citizens, unless the political subdivision is a covered political subdivision independently from its State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As used in this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the term &ldquo;voting materials&rdquo; means registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the term &ldquo;limited-English proficient&rdquo; means unable to speak or understand English adequately enough to participate in the electoral process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the term &ldquo;Indian reservation&rdquo; means any area that is an American Indian or Alaska Native area, as defined by the Census Bureau for the purposes of the 1990 decennial census;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the term &ldquo;illiteracy&rdquo; means the failure to complete the 5th primary grade.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The determinations of the Director of the Census under this subsection shall be effective upon publication in the Federal Register and shall not be subject to review in any court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirement of voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials and ballots in minority language</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any State or political subdivision subject to the prohibition of subsection (b) of this section provides any registration or voting notices, forms, instructions, assistance, or other materials or information relating to the electoral process, including ballots, it shall provide them in the language of the applicable minority group as well as in the English language: <em>Provided</em>, That where the language of the applicable minority group is oral or unwritten or in the case of Alaskan natives and American Indians, if the predominant language is historically unwritten, the State or political subdivision is only required to furnish oral instructions, assistance, or other information relating to registration and voting.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Action for declaratory judgment permitting English-only materials</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State or political subdivision subject to the prohibition of subsection (b) of this section, which seeks to provide English-only registration or voting materials or information, including ballots, may file an action against the United States in the United States District Court for a declaratory judgment permitting such provision. The court shall grant the requested relief if it determines that the illiteracy rate of the applicable language minority group within the State or political subdivision is equal to or less than the national illiteracy rate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;language minorities&rdquo; or &ldquo;language minority group&rdquo; means persons who are American Indian, Asian American, Alaskan Natives, or of Spanish heritage.</p>
