<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Statement of purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to assure adequate Federal support to foster a demonstration program to produce alternative fuels from coal, oil shale, biomass, and other domestic resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to authorize assistance, through loan guarantees under subsection&nbsp;<sup><a href="#5919_1_target" name="5919_1">1</a></sup> (b) and (y) of this section for construction and startup and related costs, to demonstration facilities for the conversion of domestic coal, oil shale, biomass, and other domestic resources into alternative fuels; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to gather information about the technological, economic, environmental, and social costs, benefits, and impacts of such demonstration facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance of obligations for alternative fuel conversion facilities; terms and conditions; rules and regulations; informational requirements; concurrence of Secretary of Treasury to terms and conditions; pledge of full faith and credit of United States; cooperative agreements for construction, etc., of modular facilities; bidding practices</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) An applicant for any financial assistance under this section shall provide information to the Secretary in such form and with such content as the Secretary deems necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Prior to issuing any guarantee under this section the Secretary shall obtain the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the timing, interest rate, and substantial terms and conditions of such guarantee. The Secretary of the Treasury shall insure to the maximum extent feasible that the timing, interest rate, and substantial terms and conditions of such guarantee will have the minimum possible impact on the capital markets of the United States, taking into account other Federal direct and indirect securities activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The full faith and credit of the United States is pledged to the payment of all guarantees issued under this section with respect to principal and interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Secretary is authorized, in the case of a facility for the conversion of oil shale to alternative fuels which is determined by the Secretary pursuant to the proviso in paragraph (1) of this subsection, to be constructed at a modular size, to enter into a cooperative agreement with the applicant in accordance with section 5907 of this title and the other provisions of this chapter to share the estimated total design and construction costs, plus operation and maintenance costs, of such modular facility. The Federal share shall not exceed 75 per centum of such costs. All receipts for the sale of any products produced during the operation of the facility shall be used to offset the costs incurred in the operation and maintenance of the facility. The provisions of subsections (d), (e), (k), (m), (p), (s), (t), (u), (v), (w), and (x) of this section shall apply to any such modular facility. The provisions of this section shall apply to any loan guarantee for such modular facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) After successful demonstration of the modular facility, as determined by the Secretary, the facility is eligible for financial assistance under this section for purposes of expansion to a full sized facility and the applicant may purchase the Federal interest in the modular facility as represented by the Federal share thereof by means of (i) a cash payment to the United States, or (ii) a share of the product or sales resulting from such expanded operation, as determined by the Secretary. If expansion of such facility is determined not to be warranted by the Secretary, he may, at the option of the applicant, dispose of the modular facility to the applicant at not less than fair market value, as determined by the Secretary as of the date of the disposal, or otherwise dispose of it, in accordance with applicable provisions of law, and distribute the net proceeds thereof, after expenses of such disposal, to the applicant in proportion to the applicant's share of the costs of such facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) To the extent possible, loan guarantees shall be issued on the basis of competitive bidding among guarantee applicants in a particular technology area.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prerequisites</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, with due regard for the need for competition, shall guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee any obligation under subsection (b) or (y) of this section only if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the amount guaranteed to any borrower at any time does not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an amount equal to 75 per centum of the project cost of the demonstration facility as estimated at the time the guarantee is issued, which cost shall not include amounts expended for facilities and equipment used in the extraction of a mineral other than coal or shale, and in the case of coal only to the extent that the Secretary determines that the coal is to be converted to alternative fuel; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an amount equal to 60 per centum of that portion of the actual total project cost of any demonstration facility which exceeds the project cost of such facility as estimated at the time the loan guarantee is issued;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the Secretary has determined that there will be a continued reasonable assurance of full repayment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the obligation is subject to the condition that it not be subordinated to any other financing;</p>

To the maximum extent possible repayment or provision therefor shall be required to be made in equal payments payable at equal intervals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the obligation provides that the Secretary shall, after a period of not less than ten years from issuance of the obligation, taking into consideration whether the Government's needs for information to be derived from the project have been substantially met and whether the project is capable of commercial operation, determine the feasibility and advisability of terminating the Federal participation in the project. In the event that such determination is positive, the Secretary shall notify the borrower and provide the borrower with not less than two nor more than three years in which to find alternative financing. At the expiration of the designated period of time, if the borrower has been unable to secure alternative financing, the Secretary is authorized to collect from the borrower an additional fee of 1 per centum per annum on the remaining obligation to which the Federal guarantee applies.</p>

The Secretary shall not guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee or enter into a cooperative agreement under subsection (b) or subsection (y) of this section, if the Governor of the State in which the proposed facility would be located recommends that such action not be taken, unless the Secretary finds that there is an overriding national interest in taking such action in order to achieve the purpose of this section. If the Secretary decides to guarantee or make a commitment to guarantee or enter into a cooperative agreement despite a Governor's recommendation not to take such action, the Secretary shall communicate, in writing, to the Governor reasons for not concurring with such recommendation. This Secretary's decision, pursuant to this subsection, shall be final unless determined upon judicial review initiated by the Governor to be unlawful by the reviewing court pursuant to section 706(2)(A) through (D) of title 5. Such review shall take place in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the State involved is located, upon application made within ninety days from the date of such decision. The Secretary shall, by regulation, establish procedures for review of, and comment on, the proposed facility by States, local political subdivisions, and Indian tribes which may be impacted by such facility, and the general public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall review and approve the plans of the applicant for the construction and operation of any demonstration and related facilities constructed or to be constructed with assistance under this section. Such plans and the actual construction shall include such monitoring and other data-gathering costs associated with such facility as are required by the comprehensive plan and program under this section. The Secretary shall determine the estimated total cost of such demonstration facility, including, but not limited to, construction costs, startup costs, costs to political subdivisions and Indian tribe by such facility, and cost of any water storage facilities needed in connection with such demonstration facility, and determine who shall pay such costs.

<p class="statutory-body">Except in accordance with reasonable terms and conditions contained in the written contract of guarantee, no guarantee issued or commitment to guarantee made under this section shall be terminated, canceled, or otherwise revoked. Such a guarantee or commitment shall be conclusive evidence that the underlying obligation is in compliance with the provisions of this section and that such obligation has been approved and is legal as to principal, interest, and other terms. Subject to the conditions of the guarantee or commitment to guarantee, such a guarantee shall be incontestable in the hands of the holder of the guaranteed obligation, except as to fraud or material misrepresentation on the part of the holder.</p>

Within such period as may be specified in the guarantee or related agreements, the Secretary shall pay to the holder of the obligation the unpaid interest on, and unpaid principal of, the guaranteed obligation as to which the borrower has defaulted, unless the Secretary finds that there was no default by the borrower in the payment of interest or principal or that such default has been remedied. Nothing in this section shall be construed to preclude any forebearance by the holder of the obligation for the benefit of the borrower which may be agreed upon by the parties to the guaranteed obligation and approved by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary makes a payment under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the Secretary shall be subrogated to the rights of the recipient of such payment (and such subrogation shall be expressly set forth in the guarantee or related agreements), including the authority to complete, maintain, operate, lease, or otherwise dispose of any property acquired pursuant to such guarantee or related agreements, or any other property of the borrower (of a value equal to the amount of such payment) to the extent that the guarantee applies to amounts in excess of the estimated project cost under subsection (c)(2)(B) of this section, without regard to the provisions of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949, as amended,<sup><a href="#5919_2_target" name="5919_2">2</a></sup> except section 207 of that Act,<sup><a href="#5919_2_target" name="5919_2">2</a></sup> or any other law, or to permit the borrower, pursuant to an agreement with the Secretary, to continue to pursue the purposes of the demonstration facility if the Secretary determines that this is in the public interest.

<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of this section, patents, including any inventions for which a waiver was made by the Secretary under section 5908 of this title, and technology resulting from the demonstration facility, shall be treated as project assets of such facility. The guarantee agreement shall include such detailed terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate to protect the interests of the United States in the case of default and to have available all the patents and technology necessary for any person selected, including, but not limited to the Secretary, to complete and operate the defaulting project. Furthermore, the guarantee agreement shall contain a provision specifying that patents, technology, and other proprietary rights which are necessary for the completion or operation of the demonstration facility shall be available to the United States and its designees on equitable terms, including due consideration to the amount of the United States default payments. Inventions made or conceived in the course of or under such guarantee, title to which is vested in the United States under this chapter, shall not be treated as project assets of such facility for disposal purposes under this subsection, unless the Secretary determines in writing that it is in the best interests of the United States to do so.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) When one or more States, political subdivisions, or Indian tribes would be eligible for assistance under this subsection, but for the fact that construction and operation of the demonstration facilities occurs outside its jurisdiction, the Secretary is authorized to provide, to the greatest extent possible, arrangements for equitable sharing of such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Such amounts as may be necessary for direct loans and grants pursuant to this subsection shall be available as provided in annual authorization Acts.</p>
