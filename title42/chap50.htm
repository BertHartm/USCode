<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4001. Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Necessity and reasons for flood insurance program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that (1) from time to time flood disasters have created personal hardships and economic distress which have required unforeseen disaster relief measures and have placed an increasing burden on the Nation's resources; (2) despite the installation of preventive and protective works and the adoption of other public programs designed to reduce losses caused by flood damage, these methods have not been sufficient to protect adequately against growing exposure to future flood losses; (3) as a matter of national policy, a reasonable method of sharing the risk of flood losses is through a program of flood insurance which can complement and encourage preventive and protective measures; and (4) if such a program is initiated and carried out gradually, it can be expanded as knowledge is gained and experience is appraised, thus eventually making flood insurance coverage available on reasonable terms and conditions to persons who have need for such protection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Participation of Federal Government in flood insurance program carried out by private insurance industry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress also finds that (1) many factors have made it uneconomic for the private insurance industry alone to make flood insurance available to those in need of such protection on reasonable terms and conditions; but (2) a program of flood insurance with large-scale participation of the Federal Government and carried out to the maximum extent practicable by the private insurance industry is feasible and can be initiated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Unified national program for flood plain management</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress further finds that (1) a program of flood insurance can promote the public interest by providing appropriate protection against the perils of flood losses and encouraging sound land use by minimizing exposure of property to flood losses; and (2) the objectives of a flood insurance program should be integrally related to a unified national program for flood plain management and, to this end, it is the sense of Congress that within two years following the effective date of this chapter the President should transmit to the Congress for its consideration any further proposals necessary for such a unified program, including proposals for the allocation of costs among beneficiaries of flood protection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of flood insurance program; flexibility in program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to (1) authorize a flood insurance program by means of which flood insurance, over a period of time, can be made available on a nationwide basis through the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and the private insurance industry, and (2) provide flexibility in the program so that such flood insurance may be based on workable methods of pooling risks, minimizing costs, and distributing burdens equitably among those who will be protected by flood insurance and the general public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Land use adjustments by State and local governments; development of proposed future construction; assistance of lending and credit institutions; relation of Federal assistance to all flood-related programs; continuing studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the further purpose of this chapter to (1) encourage State and local governments to make appropriate land use adjustments to constrict the development of land which is exposed to flood damage and minimize damage caused by flood losses, (2) guide the development of proposed future construction, where practicable, away from locations which are threatened by flood hazards, (3) encourage lending and credit institutions, as a matter of national policy, to assist in furthering the objectives of the flood insurance program, (4) assure that any Federal assistance provided under the program will be related closely to all flood-related programs and activities of the Federal Government, and (5) authorize continuing studies of flood hazards in order to provide for a constant reappraisal of the flood insurance program and its effect on land use requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Mudslides</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress also finds that (1) the damage and loss which results from mudslides is related in cause and similar in effect to that which results directly from storms, deluges, overflowing waters, and other forms of flooding, and (2) the problems involved in providing protection against this damage and loss, and the possibilities for making such protection available through a Federal or federally sponsored program, are similar to those which exist in connection with efforts to provide protection against damage and loss caused by such other forms of flooding. It is therefore the further purpose of this chapter to make available, by means of the methods, procedures, and instrumentalities which are otherwise established or available under this chapter for purposes of the flood insurance program, protection against damage and loss resulting from mudslides that are caused by accumulations of water on or under the ground.</p>

<p class="note-body">1994&mdash;Subsec. (g). Pub. L. 103&ndash;325 struck out subsec. (g) which read as follows: &ldquo;The Congress also finds that (1) the damage and loss which may result from the erosion and undermining of shorelines by waves or currents in lakes and other bodies of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels is related in cause and similar in effect to that which results directly from storms, deluges, overflowing waters, and other forms of flooding, and (2) the problems involved in providing protection against this damage and loss, and the possibilities for making such protection available through a Federal or federally sponsored program, are similar to those which exist in connection with efforts to provide protection against damage and loss caused by such other forms of flooding.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4002. Additional Congressional findings and declaration of purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) annual losses throughout the Nation from floods and mudslides are increasing at an alarming rate, largely as a result of the accelerating development of, and concentration of population in, areas of flood and mudslide hazards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the availability of Federal loans, grants, guaranties, insurance, and other forms of financial assistance are often determining factors in the utilization of land and the location and construction of public and of private industrial, commercial, and residential facilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) property acquired or constructed with grants or other Federal assistance may be exposed to risk of loss through floods, thus frustrating the purpose for which such assistance was extended;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Federal instrumentalities insure or otherwise provide financial protection to banking and credit institutions whose assets include a substantial number of mortgage loans and other indebtedness secured by property exposed to loss and damage from floods and mudslides;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Nation cannot afford the tragic losses of life caused annually by flood occurrences, nor the increasing losses of property suffered by flood victims, most of whom are still inadequately compensated despite the provision of costly disaster relief benefits; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) it is in the public interest for persons already living in flood-prone areas to have both an opportunity to purchase flood insurance and access to more adequate limits of coverage, so that they will be indemnified, for their losses in the event of future flood disasters.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purpose of this Act, therefore, is to&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3474 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) substantially increase the limits of coverage authorized under the national flood insurance program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for the expeditious identification of, and the dissemination of information concerning, flood-prone areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) require States or local communities, as a condition of future Federal financial assistance, to participate in the flood insurance program and to adopt adequate flood plan ordinances with effective enforcement provisions consistent with Federal standards to reduce or avoid future flood losses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) require the purchase of flood insurance by property owners who are being assisted by Federal programs or by federally supervised, regulated, or insured agencies or institutions in the acquisition or improvement of land or facilities located or to be located in identified areas having special flood hazards.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) any remaining administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the flood insurance and floodplain management programs (including the costs of mapping activities under section 4101 of this title) not included under clause (ii), which shall be recovered by a fee charged to policyholders and such fee shall not be subject to any agents&rsquo; commissions, company expense allowances, or State or local premium taxes,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">would be required in order to make such insurance available on an actuarial basis for any types and classes of properties for which insur<!-- PDFPage:3483 -->ance coverage is available under section 4012(a) of this title (or is recommended to the Congress under section 4012(b) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the rates, if less than the rates estimated under paragraph (1), which would be reasonable, would encourage prospective insureds to purchase flood insurance, and would be consistent with the purposes of this chapter, and which, together with a fee charged to policyholders that shall not be not subject to any agents&rsquo; commission, company expenses allowances, or State or local premium taxes, shall include any administrative expenses incurred in carrying out the flood insurance and floodplain management programs (including the costs of mapping activities under section 4101 of this title); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent, if any, to which federally assisted or other flood protection measures initiated after August 1, 1968, affect such rates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Utilization of services of other Departments and agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out subsection (a) of this section, the Director shall, to the maximum extent feasible and on a reimbursement basis, utilize the services of the Department of the Army, the Department of the Interior, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of Commerce, and the Tennessee Valley Authority, and, as appropriate, other Federal departments or agencies, and for such purposes may enter into agreements or other appropriate arrangements with any persons.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priority to studies and investigations in States or areas evidencing positive interest in securing insurance under program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall give priority to conducting studies and investigations and making estimates under this section in those States or areas (or subdivisions thereof) which he has determined have evidenced a positive interest in securing flood insurance coverage under the flood insurance program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Parishes of Louisiana; premium rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any structure existing on December 31, 1973, and located within Avoyelles, Evangeline, Rapides, or Saint Landry Parish in the State of Louisiana, which the Secretary determines is subject to additional flood hazards as a result of the construction or operation of the Atchafalaya Basin Levee System, shall be eligible for flood insurance under this chapter (if and to the extent it is eligible for such insurance under the other provisions of this chapter) at premium rates that shall not exceed those which would be applicable if such additional hazards did not exist.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Eligibility of community making adequate progress on construction of flood protection system for rates not exceeding those applicable to completed flood protection system; determination of adequate progress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any community that has made adequate progress, acceptable to the Director, on the construction of a flood protection system which will afford flood protection for the one-hundred year frequency flood as determined by the Director, shall be eligible for flood insurance under this chapter (if and to the extent it is eligible for such insurance under the other provisions of this chapter) at premium rates not exceeding those which would be applicable under this section if such flood protection system had been completed. The Director shall find that adequate progress on the construction of a flood protection system as required herein has been only if (1) 100 percent of the project cost of the system has been authorized, (2) at least 60 percent of the project cost of the system has been appropriated, (3) at least 50 percent of the project cost of the system has been expended, and (4) the system is at least 50 percent completed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Availability of flood insurance in communities restoring disaccredited flood protection systems; criteria; rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, this subsection shall only apply in a community which has been determined by the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency to be in the process of restoring flood protection afforded by a flood protection system that had been previously accredited on a Flood Insurance Rate Map as providing 100-year frequency flood protection but no longer does so. Except as provided in this subsection, in such a community, flood insurance shall be made available to those properties impacted by the disaccreditation of the flood protection system at premium rates that do not exceed those which would be applicable to any property located in an area of special flood hazard, the construction of which was started prior to the effective date of the initial Flood Insurance Rate Map published by the Director for the community in which such property is located. A revised Flood Insurance Rate Map shall be prepared for the community to delineate as Zone AR the areas of special flood hazard that result from the disaccreditation of the flood protection system. A community will be considered to be in the process of restoration if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the flood protection system has been deemed restorable by a Federal agency in consultation with the local project sponsor;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a minimum level of flood protection is still provided to the community by the disaccredited system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) restoration of the flood protection system is scheduled to occur within a designated time period and in accordance with a progress plan negotiated between the community and the Federal Emergency Management Agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Communities that the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency determines to meet the criteria set forth in paragraphs (1) and (2) as of January 1, 1992, shall not be subject to revised Flood Insurance Rate Maps that contravene the intent of this subsection. Such communities shall remain eligible for C zone rates for properties located in zone AR for any policy written prior to promulgation of final regulations for this section. Floodplain management criteria for such communities shall not require the elevation of improvements to existing structures and shall not exceed 3 feet above existing <!-- PDFPage:3484 -->grade for new construction, provided the base flood elevation based on the disaccredited flood control system does not exceed five feet above existing grade, or the remaining new construction in such communities is limited to infill sites, rehabilitation of existing structures, or redevelopment of previously developed areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency shall develop and promulgate regulations to implement this subsection, including minimum floodplain management criteria, within 24 months after October 28, 1992.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Requirement for participation in flood insurance program</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After December 31, 1971, no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided under this chapter in any area (or subdivision thereof) unless an appropriate public body shall have adopted adequate land use and control measures (with effective enforcement provisions) which the Director finds are consistent with the comprehensive criteria for land management and use under section 4102 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Agricultural structures</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Activity restrictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the adequate land use and control measures required to be adopted in an area (or subdivision thereof) pursuant to paragraph (1) may provide, at the discretion of the appropriate State or local authority, for the repair and restoration to predamaged conditions of an agricultural structure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is a repetitive loss structure; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) has incurred flood-related damage to the extent that the cost of restoring the structure to its predamaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Premium rates and coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent applicable, an agricultural structure repaired or restored pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall pay chargeable premium rates established under section 4015 of this title at the estimated risk premium rates under section 4014(a)(1) of this title. If resources are available, the Director shall provide technical assistance and counseling, upon request of the owner of the structure, regarding wet flood-proofing and other flood damage reduction measures for agricultural structures. The Director shall not be required to make flood insurance coverage available for such an agricultural structure unless the structure is wet flood-proofed through permanent or contingent measures applied to the structure or its contents that prevent or provide resistance to damage from flooding by allowing flood waters to pass through the structure, as determined by the Director.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prohibition on disaster relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any agricultural structure repaired or restored pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall not be eligible for disaster relief assistance under any program administered by the Director or any other Federal agency.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the term &ldquo;agricultural structure&rdquo; means any structure used exclusively in <!-- PDFPage:3489 -->connection with the production, harvesting, storage, raising, or drying of agricultural commodities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the term &ldquo;agricultural commodities&rdquo; means agricultural commodities and livestock.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Community rating system and incentives for community floodplain management</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authority and goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall carry out a community rating system program, under which communities participate voluntarily&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to provide incentives for measures that reduce the risk of flood or erosion damage that exceed the criteria set forth in section 4102 of this title and evaluate such measures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to encourage adoption of more effective measures that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to encourage floodplain and erosion management; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to promote the reduction of Federal flood insurance losses.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Incentives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The program shall provide incentives in the form of credits on premium rates for flood insurance coverage in communities that the Director determines have adopted and enforced measures that reduce the risk of flood and erosion damage that exceed the criteria set forth in section 4102 of this title. In providing incentives under this paragraph, the Director may provide for credits to flood insurance premium rates in communities that the Director determines have implemented measures that protect natural and beneficial floodplain functions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Credits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The credits on premium rates for flood insurance coverage shall be based on the estimated reduction in flood and erosion damage risks resulting from the measures adopted by the community under this program. If a community has received mitigation assistance under section 4104c of this title, the credits shall be phased in a manner, determined by the Director, to recover the amount of such assistance provided for the community.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 2 years after September 23, 1994, and not less than every 2 years thereafter, the Director shall submit a report to the Congress regarding the program under this subsection. Each report shall include an analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the program, any other accomplishments or shortcomings of the program, and any recommendations of the Director for legislation regarding the program.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;4104. Flood elevation determinations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Publication or notification of proposed flood elevation determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing projected flood elevations for land use purposes with respect to any community pursuant to section 4102 of this title, the Director shall first propose such determinations by publication for comment in the Federal Register, by direct notification to the chief executive officer of the community, and by publication in a prominent local newspaper.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Publication of flood elevation determinations; appeal of owner or lessee to local government; scientific or technical knowledge or information as basis for appeal; modification of proposed determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director shall publish notification of flood elevation determinations in a prominent local newspaper at least twice during the ten-day period following notification to the local government. During the ninety-day period following the second publication, any owner or lessee of real property within the community who believes his property rights to be adversely affected by the Director's proposed determination may appeal such determination to the local government. The sole basis for such appeal shall be the possession of knowledge or information indicating that the elevations being proposed by the Director with respect to an identified area having special flood hazards are scientifically or technically incorrect, and the sole relief which shall be granted under the authority of this section in the event that such appeal is sustained in accordance with subsection (e) or (f) of this section is a modification of the Director's proposed determination accordingly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Appeals by private persons; submission of negativing or contradicting data to community; opinion of community respecting justification for appeal by community; transmission of individual appeals to Director; filing of community action with Director</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Appeals by private persons shall be made to the chief executive officer of the community, or to such agency as he shall publicly designate, and shall set forth the data that tend to negate or contradict the Director's finding in such form as the chief executive officer may specify. The community shall review and consolidate all such appeals and issue a written opinion stating whether the evidence presented is sufficient to justify an appeal on behalf of such persons by the community in its own name. Whether or not the community decides to appeal the Director's determination, copies of individual appeals shall be sent to the Director as they are received by the community, and the community's appeal or a copy of its decision not to appeal shall be filed with the Director not later than ninety days after the date of the second newspaper publication of the Director's notification.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administrative review of appeals by private persons; modification of proposed determinations; decision of Director: form and distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event the Director does not receive an appeal from the community within the ninety days provided, he shall consolidate and review on their own merits, in accordance with the procedures set forth in subsection (e) of this section, the appeals filed within the community by private persons and shall make such modifications of his proposed determinations as may be appropriate, taking into account the written opinion, if any, issued by the community in not supporting such appeals. The Director's decision shall be in written form, and copies thereof shall be sent both to the chief executive officer of the community and to each individual appellant.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Administrative review of appeals by community; agencies for resolution of conflicting data; availability of flood insurance pending such resolution; time for determination of Director; community adoption of local land use and control measures within reasonable time of final determination; public inspection and admissibility in evidence of reports and other administrative information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon appeal by any community, as provided by this section, the Director shall review and take fully into account any technical or scientific data submitted by the community that tend to negate or contradict the information upon which his proposed determination is based. The Director shall resolve such appeal by consultation with officials of the local government involved, by administrative hearing, or by submission of the conflicting data to an independent scientific body or appropriate Federal agency for advice. Until the conflict in data is resolved, and the Director makes a final determination on the basis of his findings in the Federal Register, and so notifies the governing body of the community, flood insurance previously available within the community shall continue to be available, and no person shall be denied the right to purchase such insurance at chargeable rates. The Director shall make his determination within a reasonable time. The community shall be given a reasonable time after the Director's final determination in which to adopt local land use and control measures consistent with the Director's determination. The reports and other information used by the Director in making his final determination shall be made available for public inspection and shall be admissible in a court of law in the event the community seeks judicial review as provided by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Reimbursement of certain expenses; appropriation authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When, incident to any appeal under subsection (b) or (c) of this section, the owner or lessee of real property or the community, as the case may be, incurs expense in connection with the services of surveyors, engineers, or similar services, but not including legal services, in the effecting of an appeal which is successful in whole or part, the Director shall reimburse such individual or community to an extent measured by <!-- PDFPage:3502 -->the ratio of the successful portion of the appeal as compared to the entire appeal and applying such ratio to the reasonable value of all such services, but no reimbursement shall be made by the Director in respect to any fee or expense payment, the payment of which was agreed to be contingent upon the result of the appeal. There is authorized to be appropriated for purposes of implementing this subsection, not to exceed $250,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Judicial review of final administrative determinations; venue; time for appeal; scope of review; good cause for stay of final determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any appellant aggrieved by any final determination of the Director upon administrative appeal, as provided by this section, may appeal such determination to the United States district court for the district within which the community is located not more than sixty days after receipt of notice of such determination. The scope of review by the court shall be as provided by chapter 7 of title 5. During the pendency of any such litigation, all final determinations of the Director shall be effective for the purposes of this chapter unless stayed by the court for good cause shown.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Director, in consultation with representatives of the mortgage and lending industry, the Federal entities for lending regulation, the Federal agency lenders, and any other appropriate individuals, shall develop a standard form for determining, in the case of a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home, whether the building or mobile home is located in an area identified by the Director as an area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance under this chapter is available. The form shall be established by regulations issued not later than 270 days after September 23, 1994.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Design and contents</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The form under subsection (a) of this section shall be designed to facilitate compliance with the flood insurance purchase requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The form shall require identification of the type of flood-risk zone in which the building or mobile home is located, the complete map and panel numbers for the improved real estate or property on which the mobile home is located, the community identification number and community participation status (for purposes of the national flood insurance program) of the community in which the improved real estate or such property is located, and the date of the map used for the determination, with respect to flood hazard information on file with the Director. If the building or mobile home is not located in an area having special flood hazards the form shall require a statement to such effect and shall indicate the complete map and panel numbers of the improved real estate or property on which the mobile home is located. If the complete map and panel numbers are not available because the building or mobile home is not located in a community that is participating in the national flood insurance program or because no map exists for the relevant area, the form shall require a statement to such effect. The form shall provide for inclusion or attachment of any relevant documents indicating revisions or amendments to maps.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Required use</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal entities for lending regulation shall by regulation require the use of the form under this section by regulated lending institutions. Each Federal agency lender shall by regulation provide for the use of the form with respect to any loan made by such Federal agency lender. The Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation and the Government National Mortgage Association shall require the use of the form with respect to any loan purchased by such entities. A lender or other person may comply with the requirement under this subsection by using the form in a printed, computerized, or electronic manner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guarantees regarding information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing information regarding special flood hazards on the form developed under this section, any lender (or other person required to use the form) who makes, increases, extends, or renews a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home may provide for the acquisition or determination of such information to be made by a person other than such lender (or other person), only to the extent such person guarantees the accuracy of the information.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reliance on previous determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any person increasing, extending, renewing, or purchasing a loan secured by improved real estate or a mobile home may rely on a previous determination of whether the building or mobile home is located in an area having special flood hazards (and shall not be liable for any error in such previous determination), if the previous determination was made not more than 7 years before the date of the transaction and the basis for the previous determination has been set forth on a form under this section, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) map revisions or updates pursuant to section 4101(f) of this title after such previous determination have resulted in the building or mobile home being located in an area having special flood hazards; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3504 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the person contacts the Director to determine when the most recent map revisions or updates affecting such property occurred and such revisions and updates have occurred after such previous determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The regulations under this section requiring use of the form established pursuant to this section shall be issued together with the regulations required under subsection (a) of this section and shall take effect upon the expiration of the 180-day period beginning on such issuance.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Initial notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than six months following December 31, 1973, the Director shall publish information in accordance with section 4101(1) of this title, and shall notify the chief executive officer of each known flood-prone community not already participating in the national flood insurance program of its tentative identification as a community containing one or more areas having special flood hazards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Alternative actions of tentatively identified communities; public hearing; opportunity for submission of evidence; finality of administrative determination of existence or extent of flood hazard area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After such notification, each tentatively identified community shall either (1) promptly make proper application to participate in the national flood insurance program or (2) within six months submit technical data sufficient to establish to the satisfaction of the Director that the community either is not seriously flood prone or that such flood hazards as may have existed have been corrected by flood-works or other flood control methods. The Director may, in his discretion, grant a public hearing to any community with respect to which conflicting data exist as to the nature and extent of a flood hazard. If the Director decides not to hold a hearing, the community shall be given an opportunity to submit written and documentary evidence. Whether or not such hearing is granted, the Director's final determination as to the existence or extent of a flood hazard area in a particular community shall be deemed conclusive for the purposes of this Act if supported by substantial evidence in the record considered as a whole.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Subsequent notification to additional communities known to be flood prone areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As information becomes available to the Director concerning the existence of flood hazards in communities not known to be flood prone at the time of the initial notification provided for by subsection (a) of this section he shall provide similar notifications to the chief executive officers of such additional communities, which shall then be subject to the requirements of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Provisions of section 4106 applicable to flood-prone communities disqualified for flood insurance program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Formally identified flood-prone communities that do not qualify for the national flood insur<!-- PDFPage:3507 -->ance program within one year after such notification or by the date specified in section 4106 of this title, whichever is later, shall thereafter be subject to the provisions of that section relating to flood-prone communities which are not participating in the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Administrative procedures; establishment; reimbursement of certain expenses; appropriation authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Director is authorized to establish administrative procedures whereby the identification under this section of one or more areas in the community as having special flood hazards may be appealed to the Director by the community or any owner or lessee of real property within the community who believes his property has been inadvertently included in a special flood hazard area by the identification. When, incident to any appeal under this subsection, the owner or lessee of real property or the community, as the case may be, incurs expense in connection with the services of surveyors, engineers, or similar services, but not including legal services, in the effecting of an appeal which is successful in whole or part, the Director shall reimburse such individual or community to an extent measured by the ratio of the successful portion of the appeal as compared to the entire appeal and applying such ratio to the reasonable value of all such services, but no reimbursement shall be made by the Director in respect to any fee or expense payment, the payment of which was agreed to be contingent upon the result of the appeal. There is authorized to be appropriated for purposes of implementing this subsection not to exceed $250,000.</p>
