<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in any broadcast advertisement,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">with respect to energy use or efficiency or, in the case of showerheads, faucets, water closets, and urinals, water use of such product or cost of energy consumed by such product, unless such product has been tested in accordance with such amended or new test procedures and such representation fairly discloses the results of such testing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On the petition of any manufacturer, distributor, retailer, or private labeler, filed not later than the 60th day before the expiration of the period involved, the 180-day period referred to in paragraph (2) may be extended by the Secretary with respect to the petitioner (but in no event for more than an additional 180 days) if the Secretary determines that the requirements of paragraph (2) would impose an undue hardship on such petitioner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Case in which test procedure is not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary is not required to publish and prescribe test procedures for a covered product (or class thereof) if the Secretary determines, by rule, that test procedures cannot be developed which meet the requirements of subsection (b)(3) of this section and publishes such determination in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of section 6297 of this title, a determination under paragraph (1) with respect to any covered product or class shall have the same effect as would a standard prescribed for a covered product (or class).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amendment of standard</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of any amended test procedure which is prescribed pursuant to this section, the Secretary shall determine, in the rulemaking carried out with respect to prescribing such procedure, to what extent, if any, the proposed test procedure would alter the measured energy efficiency, measured energy use, or measured water use of any covered product as determined under the existing test procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines that the amended test procedure will alter the measured efficiency or measured use, the Secretary shall amend the applicable energy conservation standard during the rulemaking carried out with respect to such test procedure. In determining the amended energy conservation standard, the Secretary shall measure, pursuant to the amended test procedure, the energy efficiency, energy use, or water use of a representative sample of covered products that minimally comply with the existing standard. The average of such energy efficiency, energy use, or water use levels determined under the amended test procedure shall constitute the amended energy conservation standard for the applicable covered products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Models of covered products in use before the date on which the amended energy conservation standard becomes effective (or revisions of such models that come into use after such date and have the same energy efficiency, energy use, or water use characteristics) that comply with the energy conservation standard applicable to such covered products on the day before such date shall be deemed to comply with the amended energy conservation standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary's authority to amend energy conservation standards under this subsection shall not affect the Secretary's obligation to issue final rules as described in section 6295 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Additional consumer and commercial products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 2 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall prescribe testing requirements for refrigerated bottled or canned beverage vending machines.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) To the maximum extent practicable, the testing requirements prescribed under paragraph (1) shall be based on existing test procedures used in industry.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) After March 17, 1987, and not later than 30 days after the date on which a proposed test procedure applicable to a covered product of any of the types specified in paragraphs (1) through (13), and paragraphs (15) through (19)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6294_1_target" name="6294_1">1</a></sup> of section 6292(a) of this title (or class thereof) is prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title, the Commission shall publish a proposed labeling rule applicable to such type (or class thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Commission shall afford interested persons an opportunity to present written or oral data, views, and comments with respect to the proposed labeling rules published under para<!-- PDFPage:5293 -->graph (1). The period for such presentations shall not be less than 45 days.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Not earlier than 45 days nor later than 60 days after the date on which test procedures are prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title with respect to covered products of any type (or class thereof) specified in paragraphs (1) through (12) of section 6292(a) of this title, the Commission shall prescribe labeling rules with respect to covered products of such type (or class thereof). Not earlier than 45 days after the date on which test procedures are prescribed under section 6293(b) of this title with respect to covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6294_1_target" name="6294_1">1</a></sup> of section 6292(a) of this title, the Commission may prescribe labeling rules with respect to covered products of such type (or class thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A labeling rule prescribed under paragraph (3) shall take effect not later than 3 months after the date of prescription of such rule, except that such rules may take effect not later than 6 months after such date of prescription if the Commission determines that such extension is necessary to allow persons subject to such rules adequate time to come into compliance with such rules.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission may delay the publication of a proposed labeling rule, or the prescription of a labeling rule, beyond the dates specified in paragraph (1) or (3), if it determines that it cannot publish proposed labeling rules or prescribe labeling rules which meet the requirements of this section on or prior to the date specified in the applicable paragraph and publishes such determination in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor. In any such case, it shall publish proposed labeling rules or prescribe labeling rules for covered products of such type (or class thereof) as soon as practicable unless it determines (A) that labeling in accordance with this section is not economically or technically feasible, or (B) in the case of a type specified in paragraphs (3), (5), and (7) of section 6292(a) of this title, that labeling in accordance with this section is not likely to assist consumers in purchasing decisions. Any such determination shall be published in the Federal Register, together with the reasons therefor. This paragraph shall not apply to the prescription of a labeling rule with respect to covered products of a type specified in paragraph (19)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6294_1_target" name="6294_1">1</a></sup> of section 6292(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Content of label</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (6), a rule prescribed under this section shall require that each covered product in the type or class of covered products to which the rule applies bear a label which discloses&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the estimated annual operating cost of such product (determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title), except that if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the Secretary determines that disclosure of estimated annual operating cost is not technologically feasible, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the Commission determines that such disclosure is not likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions or is not economically feasible,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">the Commission shall require disclosure of a different useful measure of energy consumption (determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) information respecting the range of estimated annual operating costs for covered products to which the rule applies; except that if the Commission requires disclosure under subparagraph (A) of a measure of energy consumption different from estimated annual operating cost, then the label shall disclose the range of such measure of energy consumption of covered products to which such rule applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A rule under this section shall include the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) A description of the type or class of covered products to which such rule applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subject to paragraph (6), information respecting the range of estimated annual operating costs or other useful measure of energy consumption (determined in such manner as the rule may prescribe) for such type or class of covered products.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) A prototype label and directions for displaying such label.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A rule under this section shall require that the label be displayed in a manner that the Commission determines is likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and is appropriate to carry out this part. The Commission may permit a tag to be used in lieu of a label in any case in which the Commission finds that a tag will carry out the purposes for which the label was intended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A rule under this section applicable to a covered product may require disclosure, in any printed matter displayed or distributed at the point of sale of such product, of any information which may be required under this section to be disclosed on the label of such product. Requirements under this paragraph shall not apply to any broadcast advertisement or any advertisement in any newspaper, magazine, or other periodical.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Commission may require that a manufacturer of a covered product to which a rule under this section applies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) include on the label,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) separately attach to the product, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) ship with the product,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">additional information relating to energy consumption, including instructions for the maintenance, use, or repair of the covered product, if the Commission determines that such additional information would assist consumers in making purchasing decisions or in using such product, and that such requirement would not be unduly burdensome to manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Commission may delay the effective date of the requirement specified in paragraph (1)(B) of this subsection applicable to a type or class of covered product, insofar as it requires the disclosure on the label of information respecting range of a measure of energy consumption, for not more than 12 months after the date on which the rule under this section is first ap<!-- PDFPage:5294 -->plicable to such type or class, if the Commission determines that such information will not be available within an adequate period of time before such date.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this subsection shall not apply to the covered product specified in paragraphs (13), (14), (15), (16), (17), and (18) of section 6292(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) If a manufacturer of a covered product specified in paragraph (15) or (17) of section 6292(a) of this title elects to provide a label for such covered product conveying the estimated annual operating cost of such product or the range of estimated annual operating costs for the type or class of such product&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such estimated cost or range of costs shall be determined in accordance with test procedures prescribed under section 6293 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the format of such label shall be in accordance with a format prescribed by the Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such label shall be displayed in a manner, prescribed by the Commission, to be likely to assist consumers in making purchasing decisions and appropriate to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(9) <cap-smallcap>Discretionary application</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Commission may apply paragraphs (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6) of this subsection to the labeling of any product covered by paragraph (2)(I) or (6) of subsection (a).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A rule under this section (or an amendment thereto) shall not apply to any covered product the manufacture of which was completed prior to the effective date of such rule or amendment, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Study of certain products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, shall study consumer products for which labeling rules under this section have not been proposed, in order to determine (1) the aggregate energy consumption of such products, and (2) whether the imposition of labeling requirements under this section would be feasible and useful to consumers in making purchasing decisions. The Secretary shall include the results of such study in the annual report under section 6308 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary and the Commission shall consult with each other on a continuing basis as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out their respective responsibilities under this part. Before the Commission makes any determination under subsection (a)(1) of this section, it shall obtain the views of the Secretary and shall take such views into account in making such determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Other authority of the Commission</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Until such time as labeling rules under this section take effect with respect to a type or class of covered product, this section shall not affect any authority of the Commission under the Federal Trade Commission Act [15 U.S.C. 41 et seq.] to require labeling with respect to energy consumption of such type or class of covered product.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Procedure for prescribing new or amended standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard shall be prescribed in accordance with the following procedure:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A proposed rule which prescribes an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribes no amendment or no new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published in the Federal Register. In prescribing any such proposed rule with respect to a standard, the Secretary shall determine the maximum improvement in energy efficiency or maximum reduction in energy use that is technologically feasible for each type (or class) of covered products. If such standard is not designed to achieve such efficiency or use, the Secretary shall state in the proposed rule the reasons therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) After the publication of such proposed rulemaking, the Secretary shall, in accordance with section 6306 of this title, afford interested persons an opportunity, during a period of not less than 60 days, to present oral and written comments (including an opportunity to question those who make such pres<!-- PDFPage:5309 -->entations, as provided in such section) on matters relating to such proposed rule, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) whether the standard to be prescribed is economically justified (taking into account those factors which the Secretary must consider under subsection (<em>o</em>)(2) of this section) or will result in the effects described in subsection (<em>o</em>)(4) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whether the standard will achieve the maximum improvement in energy efficiency which is technologically feasible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) if the standard will not achieve such improvement, whether the reasons for not achieving such improvement are adequate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) whether such rule should prescribe a level of energy use or efficiency which is higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply in the case of any group of products within the type (or class) that will be subject to such standard.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A final rule prescribing an amended or new energy conservation standard or prescribing no amended or new standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall be published as soon as is practicable, but not less than 90 days, after publication of the proposed rule in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) <cap-smallcap>Direct final rules.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On receipt of a statement that is submitted jointly by interested persons that are fairly representative of relevant points of view (including representatives of manufacturers of covered products, States, and efficiency advocates), as determined by the Secretary, and contains recommendations with respect to an energy or water conservation standard&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) if the Secretary determines that the recommended standard contained in the statement is in accordance with subsection (<em>o</em>) or section 6313(a)(6)(B) of this title, as applicable, the Secretary may issue a final rule that establishes an energy or water conservation standard and is published simultaneously with a notice of proposed rulemaking that proposes a new or amended energy or water conservation standard that is identical to the standard established in the final rule to establish the recommended standard (referred to in this paragraph as a &ldquo;direct final rule&rdquo;); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the Secretary determines that a direct final rule cannot be issued based on the statement, the Secretary shall publish a notice of the determination, together with an explanation of the reasons for the determination.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) <cap-smallcap>Public comment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary shall solicit public comment for a period of at least 110 days with respect to each direct final rule issued by the Secretary under subparagraph (A)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Withdrawal of direct final rules.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 120 days after the date on which a direct final rule issued under subparagraph (A)(i) is published in the Federal Register, the Secretary shall withdraw the direct final rule if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the Secretary receives 1 or more adverse public comments relating to the direct final rule under subparagraph (B)(i)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6295_4_target" name="6295_4">4</a></sup> or any alternative joint recommendation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) based on the rulemaking record relating to the direct final rule, the Secretary determines that such adverse public comments or alternative joint recommendation may provide a reasonable basis for withdrawing the direct final rule under subsection (<em>o</em>), section 6313(a)(6)(B) of this title, or any other applicable law.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) <cap-smallcap>Action on withdrawal</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;On withdrawal of a direct final rule under clause (i), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) proceed with the notice of proposed rulemaking published simultaneously with the direct final rule as described in subparagraph (A)(i); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) publish in the Federal Register the reasons why the direct final rule was withdrawn.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) <cap-smallcap>Treatment of withdrawn direct final rules</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;A direct final rule that is withdrawn under clause (i) shall not be considered to be a final rule for purposes of subsection (<em>o</em>).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Effect of paragraph</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Nothing in this paragraph authorizes the Secretary to issue a direct final rule based solely on receipt of more than 1 statement containing recommended standards relating to the direct final rule.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Special rule for certain types or classes of products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A rule prescribing an energy conservation standard for a type (or class) of covered products shall specify a level of energy use or efficiency higher or lower than that which applies (or would apply) for such type (or class) for any group of covered products which have the same function or intended use, if the Secretary determines that covered products within such group&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) consume a different kind of energy from that consumed by other covered products within such type (or class); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) have a capacity or other performance-related feature which other products within such type (or class) do not have and such feature justifies a higher or lower standard from that which applies (or will apply) to other products within such type (or class).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In making a determination under this paragraph concerning whether a performance-related feature justifies the establishment of a higher or lower standard, the Secretary shall consider such factors as the utility to the consumer of such a feature, and such other factors as the Secretary deems appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any rule prescribing a higher or lower level of energy use or efficiency under paragraph (1) shall include an explanation of the basis on which such higher or lower level was established.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5310 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Inclusion in standards of test procedures and other requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any new or amended energy conservation standard prescribed under this section shall include, where applicable, test procedures prescribed in accordance with section 6293 of this title and may include any requirement which the Secretary determines is necessary to assure that each covered product to which such standard applies meets the required minimum level of energy efficiency or maximum quantity of energy use specified in such standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Determination of compliance with standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Compliance with, and performance under, the energy conservation standards (except for design standards authorized by this part) established in, or prescribed under, this section shall be determined using the test procedures and corresponding compliance criteria prescribed under section 6293 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Small manufacturer exemption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary may, on application of any manufacturer, exempt such manufacturer from all or part of the requirements of any energy conservation standard established in or prescribed under this section for any period not longer than the 24-month period beginning on the date such rule becomes effective, if the Secretary finds that the annual gross revenues of such manufacturer from all its operations (including the manufacture and sale of covered products) does not exceed $8,000,000 for the 12-month period preceding the date of the application. In making such finding with respect to any manufacturer, the Secretary shall take into account the annual gross revenues of any other person who controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, such manufacturer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may not exercise the authority granted under paragraph (1) with respect to any type (or class) of covered product subject to an energy conservation standard under this section unless the Secretary makes a finding, after obtaining the written views of the Attorney General, that a failure to allow an exemption under paragraph (1) would likely result in a lessening of competition.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(u) Battery charger and external power supply electric energy consumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Not later than 18 months after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall, after providing notice and an opportunity for comment, prescribe, by rule, definitions and test procedures for the power use of battery chargers and external power supplies.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) <cap-smallcap>External power supplies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than 2 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall issue a final rule that determines whether energy conservation standards shall be issued for external power supplies or classes of external power supplies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) <cap-smallcap>Battery chargers</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Not later than July 1, 2011, the Secretary shall issue a final rule that prescribes energy conservation standards for battery chargers or classes of battery chargers or determine that no energy conservation standard is technically feasible and economically justified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For each product class, any energy conservation standards issued under clause (i) shall be set at the lowest level of energy use that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) meets the criteria and procedures of subsections (<em>o</em>), (p), (q), (r), (s), and (t) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) would result in significant overall annual energy savings, considering standby mode and other operating modes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary and the Administrator shall collaborate and develop programs (including programs under section 6294a of this title and other voluntary industry agreements or codes of conduct) that are designed to reduce standby mode energy use.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) <cap-smallcap>Efficiency standards for class a external power supplies.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Subject to subparagraphs (B) through (D), a class A external power supply manufactured on or after the later of July 1, 2008, or December 19, 2007, shall meet the following standards:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Any State or river basin commission with a State regulation which provides for any energy conservation standard or other requirement with respect to energy use, energy efficiency, or water use for any type (or class) of covered product for which there is a Federal energy conservation standard under section 6295 of this title may file a petition with the Secretary requesting a rule that such State regulation become effective with respect to such covered product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to paragraphs (2) through (5), the Secretary shall, within the period described in paragraph (2) and after consideration of the petition and the comments of interested persons, prescribe such rule if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that the State or river basin commission has established by a preponderance of the evidence that such State regulation is needed to meet unusual and compelling State or local energy or water interests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;unusual and compelling State or local energy or water interests&rdquo; means interests which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) are substantially different in nature or magnitude than those prevailing in the United States generally; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) are such that the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of energy or water savings resulting from the State regulation make such regulation preferable or necessary when measured against the costs, benefits, burdens, and reliability of alternative approaches to energy or water savings or production, including reliance on reasonably predictable market-induced improvements in efficiency of all products subject to the State regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The factors described in clause (ii) shall be evaluated within the context of the State's energy plan and forecast, and, with respect to a State regulation for which a petition has been submitted to the Secretary which provides for any energy conservation standard or requirement with respect to water use of a covered product, within the context of the water supply and groundwater management plan, water quality program, and comprehensive plan (if any) of the State or river basin commission for improving, developing, or conserving a waterway affected by water supply development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall give notice of any petition filed under paragraph (1)(A) and afford interested persons a reasonable opportunity to make written comments, including rebuttal comments, thereon. The Secretary shall, within the 6-month period beginning on the date on which any such petition is filed, deny such petition or prescribe the requested rule, except that the Secretary may publish a notice in the Federal Register extending such period to a date certain but no longer than one year after the date on which the petition was filed. Such notice shall include the reasons for delay. In the case of any denial of a petition under this subsection, the Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register notice of, and the reasons for, such denial.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5320 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may not prescribe a rule under this subsection if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that such State regulation will significantly burden manufacturing, marketing, distribution, sale, or servicing of the covered product on a national basis. In determining whether to make such finding, the Secretary shall evaluate all relevant factors, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the extent to which the State regulation will increase manufacturing or distribution costs of manufacturers, distributors, and others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the extent to which the State regulation will disadvantage smaller manufacturers, distributors, or dealers or lessen competition in the sale of the covered product in the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the extent to which the State regulation would cause a burden to manufacturers to redesign and produce the covered product type (or class), taking into consideration the extent to which the regulation would result in a reduction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the current models, or in the projected availability of models, that could be shipped on the effective date of the regulation to the State and within the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the current or projected sales volume of the covered product type (or class) in the State and the United States; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the extent to which the State regulation is likely to contribute significantly to a proliferation of State appliance efficiency requirements and the cumulative impact such requirements would have.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not prescribe a rule under this subsection if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that interested persons have established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the State regulation is likely to result in the unavailability in the State of any covered product type (or class) of performance characteristics (including reliability), features, sizes, capacities, and volumes that are substantially the same as those generally available in the State at the time of the Secretary's finding, except that the failure of some classes (or types) to meet this criterion shall not affect the Secretary's determination of whether to prescribe a rule for other classes (or types).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) No final rule prescribed by the Secretary under this subsection may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) permit any State regulation to become effective with respect to any covered product manufactured within three years after such rule is published in the Federal Register or within five years if the Secretary finds that such additional time is necessary due to the substantial burdens of retooling, redesign, or distribution needed to comply with the State regulation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) become effective with respect to a covered product manufactured before the earliest possible effective date specified in section 6295 of this title for the initial amendment of the energy conservation standard established in such section for the covered product; except that such rule may become effective before such date if the Secretary finds (and publishes such finding) that, in addition to the other requirements of this subsection the State has established, by a preponderance of the evidence, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) there exists within the State an energy emergency condition or, if the State regulation provides for an energy conservation standard or other requirement with respect to the water use of a covered product for which there is a Federal energy conservation standard under subsection (j) or (k) of section 6295 of this title, a water emergency condition, which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) imperils the health, safety, and welfare of its residents because of the inability of the State or utilities within the State to provide adequate quantities of gas or electric energy or, in the case of a water emergency condition, water or wastewater treatment, to its residents at less than prohibitive costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) cannot be substantially alleviated by the importation of energy or, in the case of a water emergency condition, by the importation of water, or by the use of interconnection agreements; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the State regulation is necessary to alleviate substantially such condition.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) In any case in which a State is issued a rule under paragraph (1) with respect to a covered product and subsequently a Federal energy conservation standard concerning such product is amended pursuant to section 6295 of this title, any person subject to such State regulation may file a petition with the Secretary requesting the Secretary to withdraw the rule issued under paragraph (1) with respect to such product in such State. The Secretary shall consider such petition in accordance with the requirements of paragraphs (1), (3), and (4), except that the burden shall be on the petitioner to show by a preponderance of the evidence that the rule received by the State under paragraph (1) should be withdrawn as a result of the amendment to the Federal standard. If the Secretary determines that the petitioner has shown that the rule issued by the State should be so withdrawn, the Secretary shall withdraw it.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Exception for certain State procurement standards</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, any person who knowingly violates any provision of section 6302 of this title shall be subject to a civil penalty of not more than $100 for each violation. Such penalties shall be assessed by the Commission, except that penalties for violations of section 6302(a)(3) of this title which relate to requirements prescribed by the Secretary, violations of section 6302(a)(4) of this title which relate to requests of the Secretary under section 6296(b)(2) of this title, or violations of section 6302(a)(5) of this title shall be assessed by the Secretary. Civil penalties assessed under this part may be compromised by the agency or officer authorized to assess the penalty, taking into account the nature and degree of the violation and the impact of the penalty upon a particular respondent. Each violation of paragraph (1), (2), or (5) of section 6302(a) of this title shall constitute a separate violation with respect to each covered product, and each day of violation of section 6302(a)(3) or (4) of this title shall constitute a separate violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Knowingly&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in subsection (a) of this section, the term &ldquo;knowingly&rdquo; means (1) the having of actual knowledge, or (2) the presumed having of knowledge deemed to be possessed by a reasonable man who acts in the circumstances, including knowledge obtainable upon the exercise of due care.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be an unfair or deceptive act or practice in or affecting commerce (within the meaning of section 45(a)(1) of title 15) for any person to violate section 6293(c) of this title, except to the extent that such violation is prohibited under the provisions of section 6302(a)(1) of this title, in which case such provisions shall apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Procedure for assessing penalty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before issuing an order assessing a civil penalty against any person under this section, the Secretary shall provide to such person notice of the proposed penalty. Such notice shall inform such person of his opportunity to elect in writing within 30 days after the date of receipt of such notice to have the procedures of paragraph (3) (in lieu of those of paragraph (2)) apply with respect to such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Unless an election is made within 30 calendar days after receipt of notice under paragraph (1) to have paragraph (3) apply with respect to such penalty, the Secretary shall assess the penalty, by order, after a determination of violation has been made on the record after an opportunity for an agency hearing pursuant to section 554 of title 5 before an administrative law judge appointed under section 3105 of such title 5. Such assessment order shall include the administrative law judge's findings and the basis for such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any person against whom a penalty is assessed under this paragraph may, within 60 calendar days after the date of the order of the Secretary assessing such penalty, institute an action in the United States court of appeals for the appropriate judicial circuit for judicial review of such order in accordance with chapter 7 of title 5. The court shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the Secretary, or the court may remand the proceeding to the Secretary for such further action as the court may direct.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In the case of any civil penalty with respect to which the procedures of this paragraph have been elected, the Secretary shall promptly assess such penalty, by order, after the date of the receipt of the notice under paragraph (1) of the proposed penalty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the civil penalty has not been paid within 60 calendar days after the assessment order has been made under subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall institute an action in the appropriate district court of the United States for an order affirming the assessment of the civil penalty. The court shall have authority to review de novo the law and the facts involved, and shall have jurisdiction to enter a judgment enforcing, modifying, and enforcing as so modified, or setting aside in whole or in part, such assessment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any election to have this paragraph apply may not be revoked except with the consent of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If any person fails to pay an assessment of a civil penalty after it has become a final and unappealable order under paragraph (2), or after the appropriate district court has entered final judgment in favor of the Secretary under paragraph (3), the Secretary shall institute an action to recover the amount of such penalty in any appropriate district court of the United States. In such action, the validity and appropriateness of such final assessment order or judgment shall not be subject to review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of title 28 or section 7192(c) of this title, the Secretary shall be represented by the general counsel of the Department of Energy (or any attorney or attorneys within the Department of Energy designated by the Secretary) who shall supervise, conduct, and argue any civil litigation to which paragraph (3) of this subsection applies (including any related collection action under paragraph (4)) in a court of the United States or in any other court, except the Supreme Court. However, the Secretary or the general counsel shall consult with the Attorney General concerning such litigation, and the Attorney General shall provide, on request, such assistance in the conduct of such litigation as may be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to the provisions of section 7192(c) of this title, the Secretary shall be represented <!-- PDFPage:5325 -->by the Attorney General, or the Solicitor General, as appropriate, in actions under this subsection, except to the extent provided in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Section 7172(d) of this title shall not apply with respect to the functions of the Secretary under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of applying the preceding provisions of this subsection in the case of the assessment of a penalty by the Commission for a violation of paragraphs (1) and (2) of section 6302 of this title, references in such provisions to &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; and &ldquo;Department of Energy&rdquo; shall be considered to be references to the &ldquo;Commission&rdquo;.</p>
