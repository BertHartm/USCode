<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of grant</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of each grant made for purposes of this subsection shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighting of factors under paragraph (1), with severe need under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph counting one-third.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Severe need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining severe need in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall consider the ability of the qualified applicant to expend funds efficiently and the impact of relevant factors on the cost and complexity of delivering health care and support services to individuals with HIV disease in the eligible area, including factors such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, tuberculosis, severe mental illness, or other comorbid factors determined relevant by the Secretary;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) the current prevalence of HIV disease;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) unmet need for such services, as determined under section 300ff&ndash;12(b)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prevalence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the impact of the factors described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, use national, quantitative incidence data that are available for each eligible area. Not later than 18 months after October 20, 2000, the Secretary shall develop a mechanism to utilize such data. Such a mechanism shall be modified to reflect the findings of the study under section 501(b) of the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 (relating to the relationship between epidemiological measures and health care for certain individuals with HIV disease). In the absence of such data, the Secretary may consider a detailed description and qualitative analysis of severe need, as determined under subparagraph (B), including any local prevalence data gathered and analyzed by the eligible area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsequent to the development of the quantitative mechanism described in subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall phase in, over a 3-year period beginning in fiscal year 1998, the use of such a mechanism to determine the severe need of an eligible area compared to other eligible areas and to determine, in part, the amount of supplemental funds awarded to the eligible area under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remainder of amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of funds to be obligated under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include amounts that are not paid to the eligible areas under expedited procedures under subsection (a)(2) of this section as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the failure of any eligible area to submit an application under section 300ff&ndash;15(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300ff-13_2_target" name="300ff-13_2">2</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any eligible area informing the Secretary that such eligible area does not intend to expend the full amount of its grant under such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to submit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The failure of an eligible area to submit an application for an expedited grant under subsection (a)(2) of this section shall not result in such area being ineligible for a grant under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The application of an eligible area submitted under section 300ff&ndash;15(b) of this title shall contain the assurances required under subsection (a) of such section if such eligible area fails to submit an application for an expedited grant under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compliance with priorities of HIV planning council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Secretary, in carrying out section 300ff&ndash;11(a) of this title, may not make any grant under subsection (a) or (b) of this section to an eligible area unless the application submitted by such area under section 300ff&ndash;15 of this title for the grant involved demonstrates that the grants made under subsections (a) and (b) of this section to the area for the preceding fiscal year (if any) were expended in accordance with the priorities applicable to such year that were established, pursuant to section 300ff&ndash;12(b)(4)(C) of this title, by the planning council serving the area.</p>
