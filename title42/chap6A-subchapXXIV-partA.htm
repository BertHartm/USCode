<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) no later than the beginning of fiscal year 2008 or 2009, the Secretary, in consultation with the chief executive of the State in which the area is located, determines that a system has become operational in the State that provides sufficiently accurate and reliable names-based reporting of such cases throughout the State.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Requirements for exemption for fiscal year 2007</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For fiscal year 2007, an exemption under clause (ii) for an eligible area applies only if, by October 1, 2006&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">For each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2010, an exemption under clause (ii) for an eligible area applies only if, as of April 1, 2008, the State in which the area is located is substantially in compliance with the agreement under clause (iii)(II).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(v) Progress toward names-based reporting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For fiscal year 2009, the Secretary may terminate an exemption under clause (ii) for an eligible area if the State in which the area is located submitted a plan under clause (iii)(I)(aa) and the Secretary determines that the State is not substantially following the plan.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vi) Counting of cases in areas with exemptions</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">With respect to an eligible area that is under a reporting system for living non-AIDS cases of HIV that is not names-based (referred to in this subparagraph as &ldquo;code-based reporting&rdquo;), the Secretary shall, for purposes of this subparagraph, modify the number of such cases reported for the eligible area in order to adjust for duplicative reporting in and among systems that use code-based reporting.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Adjustment rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The adjustment rate under subclause (I) for an eligible area shall be a reduction of 5 percent in the number of living non-AIDS cases of HIV reported for the area.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(vii) Multiple political jurisdictions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">With respect to living non-AIDS cases of HIV, if an eligible area is not entirely within one political jurisdiction and as a result is subject to more than one reporting system for purposes of this subparagraph:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) Names-based reporting under clause (i) applies in a jurisdictional portion of the area, or an exemption under clause (ii) applies in such portion (subject to applicable provisions of this subparagraph), according to whether names-based reporting or code-based reporting is used in such portion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) If under subclause (I) both names-based reporting and code-based reporting apply in the area, the number of code-based cases shall be reduced under clause (vi).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(viii) List of eligible areas meeting standard regarding December 31, 2005</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">If an eligible area or portion thereof is in a State specified in subclause (II), the eligible area or portion shall be considered to meet the standard described in clause (ii)(I). No other eligible area or portion thereof may be considered to meet such standard.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">With respect to an eligible area that is subject to the requirement under clause (i) and is not in compliance with the requirement for names-based reporting of living non-AIDS cases of HIV, the Secretary shall, notwithstanding such noncompliance, accept reports of living cases of AIDS that are in accordance with such clause.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Applicability of exemption requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The provisions of clauses (ii) through (viii) may not be construed as having any legal effect for fiscal year 2010 or any subsequent fiscal year, and accordingly, the status of a State for purposes of such clauses may not be considered after fiscal year 2009.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(x) Program for detecting inaccurate or fraudulent counting</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall carry out a program to monitor the reporting of names-based cases for purposes of this subparagraph and to detect instances of inaccurate reporting, including fraudulent reporting.</p>
