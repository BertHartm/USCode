<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;169, title I, &sect;101(a), Dec. 14, 1999, 113 Stat. 1823, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) States are required to make reasonable efforts to find adoptive families for all children, including older children, for whom reunification with their biological family is not in the best interests of the child. However, some older children will continue to live in foster care. These children should be enrolled in an Independent Living program designed and conducted by State and local government to help prepare them for employment, postsecondary education, and successful management of adult responsibilities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Older children who continue to be in foster care as adolescents may become eligible for Independent Living programs. These Independent Living programs are not an alternative to adoption for these children. Enrollment in Independent Living programs can occur concurrent with continued efforts to locate and achieve placement in adoptive families for older children in foster care.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) About 20,000 adolescents leave the Nation's foster care system each year because they have reached 18 years of age and are expected to support themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Congress has received extensive information that adolescents leaving foster care have significant difficulty making a successful transition to adulthood; this information shows that children aging out of foster care show high rates of homelessness, non-marital childbearing, poverty, and delinquent or criminal behavior; they are also frequently the target of crime and physical assaults.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Nation's State and local governments, with financial support from the Federal Government, should offer an extensive program of education, training, employment, and financial support for young adults leaving foster care, with participation in such program beginning several years before high school graduation and continuing, as needed, until the young adults emancipated from foster care establish independence or reach 21 years of age.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Upon completion of the study, the Secretary shall issue a report to the Committee on Finance of the Senate and the Committee on Ways and Means of the House of Representatives.&rdquo;</p>
