<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Increase in allotments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any year in which the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title for a fiscal year exceeds the total amount appropriated under such section (or a corresponding provision) for the preceding fiscal year by a percentage greater than the most recent percentage change in the Consumer Price Index published by the Secretary of Labor under section 720(c)(1) of title 29 (if the percentage change indicates an increase), the Secretary shall increase each of the minimum allotments described in paragraphs (3) and (4). The Secretary shall increase each minimum allotment by an amount that bears the same ratio to the amount of such minimum allotment (including any increases in such minimum allotment under this paragraph (or a corresponding provision) for prior fiscal years) as the amount that is equal to the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title for the fiscal year for which the increase in the minimum allotment is being made; minus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the total amount appropriated under section 15029 of this title (or a corresponding provision) for the immediately preceding fiscal year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">If a State plan approved in accordance with section 15024 of this title provides for cooperative or joint effort between or among States or agencies, public or private, in more than 1 State, portions of funds allotted to 1 or more States described in this subsection may be combined in accordance with the agreements between the States or agencies involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reallotments</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that an amount of an allotment to a State for a period (of a fiscal year or longer) will not be required by the State during the period for the purpose for which the allotment was made, the Secretary may reallot the amount.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may make such a reallotment from time to time, on such date as the Secretary may fix, but not earlier than 30 days after the Secretary has published notice of the intention of the Secretary to make the reallotment in the Federal Register.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall reallot the amount to other States with respect to which the Sec<!-- PDFPage:6909 -->retary has not made that determination. The Secretary shall reallot the amount in proportion to the original allotments of the other States for such fiscal year, but shall reduce such proportionate amount for any of the other States to the extent the proportionate amount exceeds the sum that the Secretary estimates the State needs and will be able to use during such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Reallotment of reductions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall similarly reallot the total of the reductions among the States whose proportionate amounts were not so reduced.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Treatment</h4>
