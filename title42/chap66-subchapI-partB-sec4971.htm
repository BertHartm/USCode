<p class="statutory-body">(a) The purpose of this part is to assist students, through service-learning and community <!-- PDFPage:4002 -->service programs, to undertake volunteer service in such a way as to enhance the educational value of the service experience, through participation in activities that strengthen and supplement efforts to eliminate and alleviate poverty and poverty-related problems. Its purpose further is to provide technical assistance and training to encourage other students and faculty to engage in volunteer service on a part-time, self-supporting basis, to meet the needs of the poor in the surrounding community through expansion of service-learning and community service programs and otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) This part provides for the University Year for VISTA (UYV) program of full-time volunteer service by students enrolled in institutions of higher education. The purpose of the UYV program is to strengthen and supplement efforts to eliminate poverty and poverty-related human, social, and environmental problems by enabling students at cooperating institutions to perform meaningful and constructive volunteer service in connection with the satisfaction of course-work while attending such institutions. Volunteer service under this part is conducted in agencies, institutions, and situations where the application of human talent and dedication may assist in the solution of poverty and poverty-related problems and secure and exploit opportunities for self-advancement by individuals experiencing such problems.</p>
