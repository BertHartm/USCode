<p class="note-body">(iii) changes needed for selecting Federal agencies to test and evaluate new approaches to the establishment and enforcement of child support obligations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) proposals to improve service of process for civilian employees and members of the Uniformed Services stationed outside the United States, including the possibility of serving process by certified mail in establishment and enforcement cases or of designating an agent for service of process that would have the same effect and bind employees to the same extent as actual service upon the employees;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) strategies to facilitate compliance with Federal and State child support requirements by quasi-governmental agencies, advisory groups, and commissions; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) analysis of whether compliance with support orders should be a factor used in defining suitability for Federal employment.</p>
