<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) United States and District of Columbia to be subject to legal process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (including section 407 of this title), effective January 1, 1975, moneys (the entitlement to which is based upon remuneration for employment) due from, or payable by, the United States or the District of Columbia (including any agency, subdivision, or instrumentality thereof) to any individual, including members of the armed services, shall be subject, in like manner and to the same extent as if the United States or the District of Columbia were a private person, to legal process brought for the enforcement, against such individual of his legal obligations to provide child support or make alimony payments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Methods of service of legal process</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Service of legal process brought for the enforcement of an individual's obligation to provide child support or make alimony payments shall be accomplished by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service, upon the appropriate agent designated for receipt of such service of process pursuant to regulations promulgated pursuant to section 661 of this title (or, if no agent has been designated for the governmental entity having payment responsibility for the moneys involved, then upon the head of such governmental entity). Such process shall be accompanied by sufficient data to permit prompt identification of the individual and the moneys involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Disclosure of information in answering interrogatories; disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability or penalty prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No Federal employee whose duties include responding to interrogatories pursuant to requirements imposed by section 661(b)(3) of this title shall be subject under any law to any disciplinary action or civil or criminal liability or penalty for, or on account of, any disclosure of information made by him in connection with the carrying out of any of his duties which pertain (directly or indirectly) to the answering of any such interrogatory.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever any person, who is designated by law or regulation to accept service of process to which the United States is subject under this section, is effectively served with any such process or with interrogatories relating to an individual's child support or alimony payment obligations, such person shall respond thereto within thirty days (or within such longer period as may be prescribed by applicable State law) after the date effective service thereof is made, and shall, as soon as possible but not later than fifteen days after the date effective service is so made of any such process, send written notice that such process has been so served (together with a copy thereof) to the individual whose moneys are affected thereby at his duty station or last-known home address.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Variance in normal pay and disbursement cycles not required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Governmental entities affected by legal processes served for the enforcement of an individual's child support or alimony payment obligations shall not be required to vary their normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with any such legal process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Non-liability of United States, disbursing officers, and governmental entities with respect to payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Neither the United States, any disbursing officer, nor governmental entity shall be liable with respect to any payment made from moneys due or payable from the United States to any individual pursuant to legal process regular on its face, if such payment is made in accordance with this section and the regulations issued to carry out this section.</p>
