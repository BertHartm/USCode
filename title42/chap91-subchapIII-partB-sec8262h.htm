<p class="statutory-body">The Postmaster General shall issue regulations to ensure the reliable and accurate accounting of energy consumption costs for all buildings or facilities which it owns, leases, operates, or manages. Such regulations shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) establish a monitoring system to determine which facilities are the most costly to operate on an energy consumption per square foot basis or other relevant analytical basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) identify unusual or abnormal changes in energy consumption; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) check the accuracy of utility charges for electricity and gas consumption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Identification of energy efficiency products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Postmaster General shall actively undertake a program to identify and procure energy efficiency products for use in its facilities.

L. 102&ndash;486 directed Postmaster General to conduct an energy survey, as defined in 42 U.S.C. 8259(5), for purposes of determining maximum potential cost effective energy savings that may be achieved in a representative sample of buildings owned or leased by United States Postal Service in different areas of the country, making recommendations for cost effective energy efficiency and renewable energy improvements in those buildings and in other similar United States Postal Service buildings, and identifying barriers which may prevent the United States Postal Service from complying with energy management goals, and further directed Postmaster General to transmit to Congress within 180 days after Oct. 24, 1992, a plan for implementing this survey, and to report to Congress on the findings and conclusions of such survey as soon as practicable after its completion.</p>
