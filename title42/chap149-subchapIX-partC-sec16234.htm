<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall conduct a program of research and development to evaluate the potential for concentrating solar power for hydrogen production, including cogeneration approaches for both hydrogen and electricity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program shall take advantage of existing facilities to the extent practicable and shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) development of optimized technologies that are common to both electricity and hydrogen production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) evaluation of thermochemical cycles for hydrogen production at the temperatures attainable with concentrating solar power;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) evaluation of materials issues for the thermochemical cycles described in paragraph (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) cogeneration of solar thermal electric power and photo-synthetic-based hydrogen production;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) system architectures and economics studies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) coordination with activities under the Next Generation Nuclear Plant Project estab<!-- PDFPage:7527 -->lished under part B of subchapter VI on high temperature materials, thermochemical cycles, and economic issues.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In carrying out the program under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) assess conflicting guidance on the economic potential of concentrating solar power for electricity production received from the National Research Council in the report entitled &ldquo;Renewable Power Pathways: A Review of the U.S. Department of Energy's Renewable Energy Programs&rdquo; and dated 2000 and subsequent reviews of that report funded by the Department; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide an assessment of the potential impact of technology used to concentrate solar power for electricity before, or concurrent with, submission of the budget for fiscal year 2008.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 5 years after August 8, 2005, the Secretary shall provide to Congress a report on the economic and technical potential for electricity or hydrogen production, with or without cogeneration, with concentrating solar power, including the economic and technical feasibility of potential construction of a pilot demonstration facility suitable for commercial production of electricity or hydrogen from concentrating solar power.</p>
