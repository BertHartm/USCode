<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The United States of America annually produces millions of tons of pollution and spends tens of billions of dollars per year controlling this pollution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) There are significant opportunities for industry to reduce or prevent pollution at the source through cost-effective changes in production, operation, and raw materials use. Such changes offer industry substantial savings in reduced raw material, pollution control, and liability costs as well as help protect the environment and reduce risks to worker health and safety.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The opportunities for source reduction are often not realized because existing regulations, and the industrial resources they require for compliance, focus upon treatment and disposal, rather than source reduction; existing regulations do not emphasize multi-media management of pollution; and businesses need information and technical assistance to overcome institutional barriers to the adoption of source reduction practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Source reduction is fundamentally different and more desirable than waste management and pollution control. The Environmental Protection Agency needs to address the historical lack of attention to source reduction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) As a first step in preventing pollution through source reduction, the Environmental Protection Agency must establish a source reduction program which collects and disseminates information, provides financial assistance to States, and implements the other activities provided for in this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress hereby declares it to be the national policy of the United States that pollution should be prevented or reduced at the source whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented should be recycled in an environmentally safe manner, whenever feasible; pollution that cannot be prevented or recycled should be treated in an environmentally safe manner whenever feasible; and disposal or other release into the environment should be employed only as a last resort and should be conducted in an environmentally safe manner.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Reporting requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each owner or operator of a facility required to file an annual toxic chemical release form under section 11023 of this title for any toxic chemical shall include with each such annual filing a toxic chemical source reduction and recycling report for the preceeding&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13106_1_target" name="13106_1">1</a></sup> calendar year. The toxic chemical source reduction and recycling report shall cover each toxic chemical required to be reported in the annual toxic chemical release form filed by the owner or operator under section 11023(c) of this title. This section shall take effect with the annual report filed under section 11023 of this title for the first full calendar year beginning after November 5, 1990.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Items included in report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The toxic chemical source reduction and recycling report required under subsection (a) of this section shall set forth each of the following on a facility-by-facility basis for each toxic chemical:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The quantity of the chemical entering any waste stream (or otherwise released into the environment) prior to recycling, treatment, or disposal during the calendar year for which the report is filed and the percentage change from the previous year. The quantity reported shall not include any amount reported under paragraph (7). When actual measurements of the quantity of a toxic chemical entering the waste streams are not readily available, reasonable estimates should be made based on best engineering judgment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount of the chemical from the facility which is recycled (at the facility or elsewhere) during such calendar year, the percentage change from the previous year, and the process of recycling used.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The source reduction practices used with respect to that chemical during such year at the facility. Such practices shall be reported in accordance with the following categories unless the Administrator finds other categories to be more appropriate.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5558 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Equipment, technology, process, or procedure modifications.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Reformulation or redesign of products.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Substitution of raw materials.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Improvement in management, training, inventory control, materials handling, or other general operational phases of industrial facilities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The amount expected to be reported under paragraph&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13106_2_target" name="13106_2">2</a></sup> (1) and (2) for the two calendar years immediately following the calendar year for which the report is filed. Such amount shall be expressed as a percentage change from the amount reported in paragraphs (1) and (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) A ratio of production in the reporting year to production in the previous year. The ratio should be calculated to most closely reflect all activities involving the toxic chemical. In specific industrial classifications subject to this section, where a feedstock or some variable other than production is the primary influence on waste characteristics or volumes, the report may provide an index based on that primary variable for each toxic chemical. The Administrator is encouraged to develop production indexes to accommodate individual industries for use on a voluntary basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The techniques which were used to identify source reduction opportunities. Techniques listed should include, but are not limited to, employee recommendations, external and internal audits, participative team management, and material balance audits. Each type of source reduction listed under paragraph (3) should be associated with the techniques or multiples of techniques used to identify the source reduction technique.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The amount of any toxic chemical released into the environment which resulted from a catastrophic event, remedial action, or other one-time event, and is not associated with production processes during the reporting year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The amount of the chemical from the facility which is treated (at the facility or elsewhere) during such calendar year and the percentage change from the previous year. For the first year of reporting under this subsection, comparison with the previous year is required only to the extent such information is available.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) SARA provisions</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Biennial reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall provide Congress with a report within eighteen months after November 5, 1990, and biennially thereafter, containing a detailed description of the actions taken to implement the strategy to promote source reduction developed under section 13103(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13107_1_target" name="13107_1">1</a></sup> of this title and of the results of such actions. The report shall include an assessment of the effectiveness of the clearinghouse and grant program established under this chapter in promoting the goals of the strategy, and shall evaluate data gaps and data duplication with respect to data collected under Federal environmental statutes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Subsequent reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each biennial report submitted under subsection (a) of this section after the first report shall contain each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) An analysis of the data collected under section 13106 of this title on an industry-by-industry basis for not less than five SIC codes or other categories as the Administrator deems appropriate. The analysis shall begin with those SIC codes or other categories of facilities which generate the largest quantities of toxic chemical waste. The analysis shall include an evaluation of trends in source reduction by industry, firm size, production, or other useful means. Each such subsequent report shall cover five SIC codes or other categories which were not covered in a prior report until all SIC codes or other categories have been covered.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) An analysis of the usefulness and validity of the data collected under section 13106 of this title for measuring trends in source reduction and the adoption of source reduction by business.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Identification of regulatory and nonregulatory barriers to source reduction, and of opportunities for using existing regulatory programs, and incentives and disincentives to promote and assist source reduction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Identification of industries and pollutants that require priority assistance in multi-media source reduction&nbsp;<sup><a href="#13107_2_target" name="13107_2">2</a></sup></p>
<!-- PDFPage:5559 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Recommendations as to incentives needed to encourage investment and research and development in source reduction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Identification of opportunities and development of priorities for research and development in source reduction methods and techniques.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) An evaluation of the cost and technical feasibility, by industry and processes, of source reduction opportunities and current activities and an identification of any industries for which there are significant barriers to source reduction with an analysis of the basis of this identification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) An evaluation of methods of coordinating, streamlining, and improving public access to data collected under Federal environmental statutes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) An evaluation of data gaps and data duplication with respect to data collected under Federal environmental statutes.</p>
