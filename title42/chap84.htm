<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress therefore declares that the establishment of a Department of Energy is in the public interest and will promote the general welfare by assuring coordinated and effective administration of Federal energy policy and programs. It is the purpose of this chapter:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To establish a Department of Energy in the executive branch.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To achieve, through the Department, effective management of energy functions of the Federal Government, including consultation with the heads of other Federal departments and agencies in order to encourage them to establish and observe policies consistent with a coordinated energy policy, and to promote maximum possible energy conservation measures in connection with the activities within their respective jurisdictions.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title&nbsp;5</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to the other requirements of this subchapter, the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of title 5 shall apply in accordance with its terms to any rule or regulation, or any order having the applicability and effect of a rule (as defined in section 551(4) of title 5), issued pursuant to authority vested by law in, or transferred or delegated to, the Secretary, or required by this chapter or any other Act to be carried out by any other officer, employee, or component of the Department, other than the Commission, including any such rule, regulation, or order of a State, or local government agency or officer thereof, issued pursuant to authority delegated by the Secretary in accordance with this subchapter. If any provision of any Act, the functions of which are transferred, vested, or delegated pursuant to this chapter, provides administrative procedure requirements in addition to the requirements provided in this subchapter, such additional requirements shall also apply to actions under that provision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), this subchapter shall apply to the Commission to the same extent this subchapter applies to the Secretary in the exercise of any of the Commission's functions under section 7172(c)(1) of this title or which the Secretary has assigned under section 7172(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Substantial issue of fact or law or likelihood of substantial impact on Nation's economy, etc.; oral presentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary determines, on his own initiative or in response to any showing made pursuant to paragraph (2) (with respect to a proposed rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a) of this section) that no substantial issue of fact or law exists and that such rule, regulation, or order is unlikely to have a substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses, such proposed rule, regulation, or order may be promulgated in accordance with section 553 of title <!-- PDFPage:5384 -->5. If the Secretary determines that a substantial issue of fact or law exists or that such rule, regulation, or order is likely to have a substantial impact on the Nation's economy or large numbers of individuals or businesses, an opportunity for oral presentation of views, data, and arguments shall be provided.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any person, who would be adversely affected by the implementation of any proposed rule, regulation, or order who desires an opportunity for oral presentation of views, data, and arguments, may submit material supporting the existence of such substantial issues or such impact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A transcript shall be kept of any oral presentation with respect to a rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The requirements of subsection (b) of this section may be waived where strict compliance is found by the Secretary to be likely to cause serious harm or injury to the public health, safety, or welfare, and such finding is set out in detail in such rule, regulation, or order. In the event the requirements of this section are waived, the requirements shall be satisfied within a reasonable period of time subsequent to the promulgation of such rule, regulation, or order.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effects confined to single unit of local government, geographic area within State, or State; hearing or oral presentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) With respect to any rule, regulation, or order described in subsection (a) of this section, the effects of which, except for indirect effects of an inconsequential nature, are confined to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a single unit of local government or the residents thereof;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a single geographic area within a State or the residents thereof; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a single State or the residents thereof;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall, in any case where appropriate, afford an opportunity for a hearing or the oral presentation of views, and provide procedures for the holding of such hearing or oral presentation within the boundaries of the unit of local government, geographic area, or State described in paragraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;unit of local government&rdquo; means a county, municipality, town, township, village, or other unit of general government below the State level; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prescription of procedures for State and local government agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where authorized by any law vested, transferred, or delegated pursuant to this chapter, the Secretary may, by rule, prescribe procedures for State or local government agencies authorized by the Secretary to carry out such functions as may be permitted under applicable law. Such procedures shall apply to such agencies in lieu of this section, and shall require that prior to taking any action, such agencies shall take steps reasonably calculated to provide notice to persons who may be affected by the action, and shall afford an opportunity for presentation of views (including oral presentation of views where practicable) within a reasonable time before taking the action.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary is authorized to enter into and perform such contracts, leases, cooperative agreements, or other similar transactions with public agencies and private organizations and persons, and to make such payments (in lump sum or installments, and by way of advance or reimbursement) as he may deem to be necessary or appropriate to carry out functions now or hereafter vested in the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Limitation on authority; appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, no authority to enter into contracts or to make payments under this subchapter shall be effective except to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Leasing of excess Department of Energy property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may lease, upon terms and conditions the Secretary considers appropriate to promote national security or the public interest, acquired real property and related personal property that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is under the control of the Department of Energy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Terms of lease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section may not be for a term of more than 10 years, except that the Secretary may enter into a lease that includes an option to renew for a term of more than 10 years if the Secretary determines that entering into such a lease will promote the national security or be in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section may provide for the payment (in cash or in kind) by the lessee of consideration in an amount that is less than the fair market rental value of the leasehold interest.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Environmental concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Before entering into a lease under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall consult with the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (with respect to prop<!-- PDFPage:5392 -->erty located on a site on the National Priorities List) or the appropriate State official (with respect to property located on a site that is not listed on the National Priorities List) to determine whether the environmental conditions of the property are such that leasing the property, and the terms and conditions of the lease agreement, are consistent with safety and the protection of public health and the environment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before entering into a lease under subsection (c) of this section, the Secretary shall obtain the concurrence of the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency or the appropriate State official, as the case may be, in the determination required under paragraph (1). The Secretary may enter into a lease under subsection (c) of this section without obtaining such concurrence if, within 60 days after the Secretary requests the concurrence, the Administrator or appropriate State official, as the case may be, fails to submit to the Secretary a notice of such individual's concurrence with, or rejection of, the determination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Retention and use of rentals; report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent provided in advance in appropriations Acts, the Secretary may retain and use money rentals received by the Secretary directly from a lease entered into under subsection (c) of this section in any amount the Secretary considers necessary to cover the administrative expenses of the lease, the maintenance and repair of the leased property, or environmental restoration activities at the facility where the leased property is located. Amounts retained under this subsection shall be retained in a separate fund established in the Treasury for such purpose. The Secretary shall annually submit to the Congress a report on amounts retained and amounts used under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A transaction under paragraph (1) shall relate to a research, development, or demonstration project only if the Secretary determines in writing that the use of a standard contract, grant, or cooperative agreement for the project is not feasible or appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may protect from disclosure, for up to 5 years after the date on which the information is developed, any information developed pursuant to a transaction under paragraph (1) that would be protected from disclosure under section 552(b)(4) of title 5, if obtained from a person other than a Federal agency.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7274p. Advice to President and Congress regarding safety, security, and reliability of United States nuclear weapons stockpile</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Nuclear weapons are the most destructive weapons on earth. The United States and its allies continue to rely on nuclear weapons to deter potential adversaries from using weapons of mass destruction. The safety and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile are essential to ensure its credibility as a deterrent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) On September 24, 1996, President Clinton signed the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Effective as of September 30, 1996, the United States is prohibited by section 507 of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 1993 (Public Law 102&ndash;377; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> from conducting underground nuclear tests &ldquo;unless a foreign state conducts a nuclear test after this date, at which time the prohibition on United States nuclear testing is lifted&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Section 1436(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 1989 (Public Law 100&ndash;456; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> requires the Secretary of Energy to &ldquo;establish and support a program to assure that the United States is in a position to maintain the reliability, safety, and continued deterrent effect of its stockpile of existing nuclear weapons designs in the event that a low-threshold or comprehensive test ban on nuclear explosive testing is negotiated and ratified.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Section 3138(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> (Public Law 103&ndash;160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note) required the President to submit an annual report to Congress which sets forth &ldquo;any concerns with respect to the safety, security, effectiveness, or reliability of existing United States nuclear weapons raised by the Stockpile Stewardship Program of the Department of Energy&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) President Clinton declared in July 1993 that &ldquo;to assure that our nuclear deterrent remains unquestioned under a test ban, we will explore other means of maintaining our confidence in the safety, reliability, and the performance of our weapons&rdquo;. This decision was incorporated in a Presidential Directive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Section 3138 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1994 (Public Law 103&ndash;160; 42 U.S.C. 2121 note)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7274p_1_target" name="7274p_1">1</a></sup> also requires that the Secretary of Energy establish a &ldquo;stewardship program to ensure the preservation of the core intellectual and technical competencies of the United States in nuclear weapons&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The plan of the Department of Energy to maintain the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile is known as the Stockpile Stewardship and Management Program. The ability of the United States to maintain and certify the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile without testing will require utilization of new and sophisticated computational capabilities and diagnostic technologies, methods, and procedures. Current diagnostic technologies and laboratory testing techniques are insufficient to certify the safety and reliability of the United States nuclear weapons stockpile into the future. Whereas in the past laboratory and diagnostic tools were used in conjunction with nuclear testing, in the future they will provide, under the Department of Energy's stockpile stewardship plan, the sole basis for assessing past test data and for making judgments on phenomena observed in connection with the aging of the stockpile.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Section 3159 of the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1997 (Public Law 104&ndash;201; 42 U.S.C. 7274<em>o</em>) requires that the directors of the nuclear weapons laboratories and the nuclear weapons production plants submit a report to the Assistant Secretary of Energy for Defense Programs if they identify a problem that has significant bearing on confidence in the safety or reliability of a nuclear weapon or nuclear weapon type, that the Assistant Secretary must transmit that report, along with any comments, to the congressional defense committees and to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense, and that the Joint Nuclear Weapons Council advise Congress regarding its analysis of any such problems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) On August 11, 1995, President Clinton directed &ldquo;the establishment of a new annual reporting and certification requirement [to] ensure that our nuclear weapons remain safe and reliable under a comprehensive test ban&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) On the same day, the President noted that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Energy have the responsibility, after being &ldquo;advised by the Nuclear Weapons Council, the Directors of DOE's nuclear weapons laboratories, and the Commander of United States Strategic Command&rdquo;, to provide the President with the information regarding the certification referred to in paragraph (10).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5408 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) The Joint Nuclear Weapons Council established by section 179 of title 10 is responsible for providing advice to the Secretary of Energy and the Secretary of Defense regarding nuclear weapons issues, including &ldquo;considering safety, security, and control issues for existing weapons&rdquo;. The Council plays a critical role in advising Congress in matters relating to nuclear weapons.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) It is essential that the President receive well-informed, objective, and honest opinions, including dissenting views, from his advisers and technical experts regarding the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the nuclear weapons stockpile.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to maintain a safe, secure, effective, and reliable nuclear weapons stockpile; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) as long as other nations control or actively seek to acquire nuclear weapons, to retain a credible nuclear deterrent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Nuclear weapons stockpile</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is in the security interest of the United States to sustain the United States nuclear weapons stockpile through a program of stockpile stewardship, carried out at the nuclear weapons laboratories and nuclear weapons production plants.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the United States should retain a triad of strategic nuclear forces sufficient to deter any future hostile foreign leadership with access to strategic nuclear forces from acting against the vital interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the United States should continue to maintain nuclear forces of sufficient size and capability to implement an effective and robust deterrent strategy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the advice of the persons required to provide the President and Congress with assurances of the safety, security, effectiveness, and reliability of the nuclear weapons force should be scientifically based, without regard for politics, and of the highest quality and integrity.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after October 24, 1992, the Administrator shall, by regulation, revise the Final Amended Guidelines and Acceptance Criteria for Customer Conservation and Renewable Energy Programs published in the Federal Register on August 21, 1985 (50 F.R. 33892), or any subsequent amendments thereto, to require each customer to fully comply with the applicable integrated resource plan and submit an annual report to the Administrator (in such form and containing such information as the Administrator may require) describing the customer's progress to the goals established in such plan. After the initial review under subsection (a) of this section the Administrator shall periodically conduct reviews of a representative sample of applicable integrated resource plans and the customer's implementation of the applicable integrated resource plan to determine if the customers are in compliance with their plans. If the Administrator finds a customer out-of-compliance, the Administrator shall impose a surcharge under this section on all electric energy purchased by the customer from the Western Area Power Administration or reduce such customer's power allocation by 10 percent, unless the Administrator finds that a good faith effort has been made to comply with the approved plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Enforcement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) No approved plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an integrated resource plan for any customer is not submitted before the date 12 months after the guidelines are amended as required under this section or if the plan is disapproved by the Administrator and a revised plan is not resubmitted by the date 9 months after the date of such disapproval, the Administrator shall impose a surcharge of 10 percent of the purchase price on all power obtained by that customer from the Western Area Power Administration after such date. The surcharge shall remain in effect until an integrated resource plan is approved for that customer. If the plan is not submitted for more than one year after the required date, the surcharge shall increase to 20 percent for the second year (or any portion thereof prior to approval of the plan) and to 30 percent thereafter until the plan is submitted or the contract for the purchase of power by such customer from the Western Area Power Administration terminates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Failure to comply with approved plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After approval by the Administrator of an applicable integrated resource plan for any customer, the Administrator shall impose a 10 percent surcharge on all power purchased by such customer from the Western Area Power Administration whenever the Administrator determines that such customer's activities are not consistent with the applicable integrated resource plan. The surcharge shall remain in effect until the Administrator determines that the customer's activities are consistent with the applicable integrated resource plan. The surcharge shall be increased to 20 percent if the customer's activities are out of compliance for more than one year and to 30 percent after more than 2 years, except that no surcharge shall be imposed if the customer demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Administrator, that a good faith effort has been made to comply with the approved plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Reduction in power allocation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of any customer subject to a surcharge under paragraph (1) or (2), in lieu of imposing such surcharge the Administrator may reduce such customer's power allocation from the Western Area Power Administration by 10 percent. The Administrator shall provide by regulation the terms and conditions under which a power allocation terminated under this subsection may be reinstated.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Integrated resource planning cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With the approval of the Administrator, customers within any State or region may form integrated resource planning cooperatives for the purposes of complying with sections 7275 to 7276c of this title, and such customers shall be allowed an additional 6 months to submit an initial integrated resource plan to the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Customers with more than 1 contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If more than one long-term firm power service contract exists between the Administrator and a customer, only one integrated resource plan shall be required for that customer under sections 7275 to 7276c of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Program review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Within 1 year after January 1, 1999, and at appropriate intervals thereafter, the Adminis<!-- PDFPage:5412 -->trator shall initiate a public process to review the program established by this section. The Administrator is authorized at that time to revise the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this section to reflect changes, if any, in technology, needs, or other developments.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Scientific, technical, and engineering competence is essential to the Nation's future well-being.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The scientific, technical, and engineering capability at the Federal laboratories is unmatched throughout the world.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Superb research, development, testing, and evaluation occur in Department of Energy research and development facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Department of Energy research and development facilities will play an increasing role in assuring that the United States remains competitive in world markets.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Improvements in mathematics, science, and engineering education are needed desperately to provide the trained and educated citizenry essential to the future competitiveness of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The future health and vitality of the economy of the United States is predicated on the availability of an adequate supply of scientists, mathematicians, and engineers to provide for growing needs and to replenish the workforce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) United States college and university enrollment in science, mathematics, and engineering programs is sharply declining at undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The Federal Government is the largest United States employer of research scientists, mathematicians, and engineers, and the Department of Energy has a growing need for scientists, mathematicians, and engineers at a time when these enrollments are declining.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Women and minorities are grossly underrepresented in science and mathematics fields, and this group represents more than 80 percent of the projected increase in the national workforce through the year 2000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this subchapter are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to encourage the development and implementation of science, mathematics, and engineering education programs at the Department of Energy and at its research and development facilities as part of a national effort to improve science, mathematics, and engineering education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide more efficient coordination among science, mathematics, and engineering education programs.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7384. Findings; sense of Congress</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Since World War II, Federal nuclear activities have been explicitly recognized under Federal law as activities that are ultra-hazardous. Nuclear weapons production and testing have involved unique dangers, including potential catastrophic nuclear accidents that private insurance carriers have not covered and recurring exposures to radioactive substances and beryllium that, even in small amounts, can cause medical harm.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Since the inception of the nuclear weapons program and for several decades afterwards, a large number of nuclear weapons workers at sites of the Department of Energy and at sites of vendors who supplied the Cold War effort were put at risk without their knowledge and consent for reasons that, documents reveal, were driven by fears of adverse publicity, liability, and employee demands for hazardous duty pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Many previously secret records have documented unmonitored exposures to radiation and beryllium and continuing problems at these sites across the Nation, at which the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies have been, since World War II, self-regulating with respect to nuclear safety and occupational safety and health. No other hazardous Federal activity has been permitted to be carried out under such sweeping powers of self-regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The policy of the Department of Energy has been to litigate occupational illness claims, which has deterred workers from filing workers&rsquo; compensation claims and has imposed major financial burdens for such employees who have sought compensation. Contractors of the Department have been held harmless and the employees have been denied workers&rsquo; compensation coverage for occupational disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Over the past 20 years, more than two dozen scientific findings have emerged that indicate that certain of such employees are experiencing increased risks of dying from cancer and non-malignant diseases. Several of these studies have also established a correlation between excess diseases and exposure to radiation and beryllium.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) While linking exposure to occupational hazards with the development of occupational disease is sometimes difficult, scientific evidence supports the conclusion that occupational exposure to dust particles or vapor of beryllium can cause beryllium sensitivity and chronic beryllium disease. Furthermore, studies indicate than 98 percent of radiation-induced cancers within the nuclear weapons complex have occurred at dose levels below existing maximum safe thresholds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Existing information indicates that State workers&rsquo; compensation programs do not provide a uniform means of ensuring adequate compensation for the types of occupational illnesses and diseases that relate to the employees at those sites.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To ensure fairness and equity, the civilian men and women who, over the past 50 years, have performed duties uniquely related to the nuclear weapons production and testing programs of the Department of Energy and its predecessor agencies should have efficient, uniform, and adequate compensation for beryllium-related health conditions and radiation-related health conditions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) On April 12, 2000, the Secretary of Energy announced that the Administration intended to seek compensation for individuals with a broad range of work-related illnesses throughout the Department of Energy's nuclear weapons complex.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) However, as of October 2, 2000, the Administration has failed to provide Congress with the necessary legislative and budget proposals to enact the promised compensation program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a program should be established to provide compensation to covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a fund for payment of such compensation should be established on the books of the Treasury;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) payments from that fund should be made only after&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the identification of employees of the Department of Energy (including its predecessor agencies), and of contractors of the Department, who may be members of the group of covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the establishment of a process to receive and administer claims for compensation for disability or death of covered employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the submittal by the President of a legislative proposal for compensation of such employees that includes the estimated annual budget resources for that compensation; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13179. Providing Compensation to America's Nuclear Weapons Workers</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13179, Dec. 7, 2000, 65 F.R. 77487, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including Public Law 106&ndash;398, the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.] (Public Law 106&ndash;398, the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), and to allocate the responsibilities imposed by that legislation and to provide for further legislative efforts, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy</em>. Since World War II, hundreds of thousands of men and women have served their Nation in building its nuclear defense. In the course of their work, they overcame previously unimagined scientific and technical challenges. Thousands of these courageous Americans, however, paid a high price for their service, developing disabling or fatal illnesses as a result of exposure to beryllium, ionizing radiation, and other hazards unique to nuclear weapons production and testing. Too often, these workers were neither adequately protected from, nor informed of, the occupational hazards to which they were exposed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Existing workers&rsquo; compensation programs have failed to provide for the needs of these workers and their families. Federal workers&rsquo; compensation programs have generally not included these workers. Further, because of long latency periods, the uniqueness of the hazards to which they were exposed, and inadequate exposure data, many of these individuals have been unable to obtain State workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. This problem has been exacerbated by the past policy of the Department of Energy (DOE) and its predecessors of encouraging and assisting DOE contractors in opposing the claims of workers who sought those benefits. This policy has recently been reversed.</p>
<p class="note-body">While the Nation can never fully repay these workers or their families, they deserve recognition and com<!-- PDFPage:5430 -->pensation for their sacrifices. Since the Administration's historic announcement in July of 1999 that it intended to compensate DOE nuclear weapons workers who suffered occupational illnesses as a result of exposure to the unique hazards in building the Nation's nuclear defense, it has been the policy of this Administration to support fair and timely compensation for these workers and their survivors. The Federal Government should provide necessary information and otherwise help employees of the DOE or its contractors determine if their illnesses are associated with conditions of their nuclear weapons-related work; it should provide workers and their survivors with all pertinent and available information necessary for evaluating and processing claims; and it should ensure that this program minimizes the administrative burden on workers and their survivors, and respects their dignity and privacy. This order sets out agency responsibilities to accomplish these goals, building on the Administration's articulated principles and the framework set forth in the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000 [42 U.S.C. 7384 et seq.]. The Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Energy shall be responsible for developing and implementing actions under the Act to compensate these workers and their families in a manner that is compassionate, fair, and timely. Other Federal agencies, as appropriate, shall assist in this effort.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Designation of Responsibilities for Administering the Energy Employees&rsquo; Occupational Illness Compensation Program (&ldquo;Program&rdquo;).</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Secretary of Labor</em>. The Secretary of Labor shall have primary responsibility for administering the Program. Specifically, the Secretary shall:</p>

<p class="note-body">(v) Pursuant to Subtitle D of the Act [42 U.S.C. 7385<em>o</em>], negotiate agreements with the chief executive officer of each State in which there is a DOE facility, and other States as appropriate, to provide assistance to a DOE contractor employee on filing a State workers&rsquo; compensation system claim, and establish a Worker Assistance Program to help individuals whose illness is related to employment in the DOE's nuclear weapons complex, or the individual's survivor if the individual is deceased, in applying for State workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. This assistance shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Submittal of reasonable claims to a physician panel, appointed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services and administered by the Secretary of Energy, under procedures established by the Secretary of Energy, for determination of whether the individual's illness or death arose out of and in the course of employment by the DOE or its contractors and exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) For cases determined by the physician panel and the Secretary of Energy under section 3661(d) and (e) of the Act [42 U.S.C. 7385<em>o</em>(d), (e)] to have arisen out of and in the course of employment by the DOE or its contractors and exposure to a toxic substance at a DOE facility, provide assistance to the individual in filing for workers&rsquo; compensation benefits. The Secretary shall not contest these claims and, to the extent permitted by law, shall direct a DOE contractor who employed the applicant not to contest the claim;</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) Report on the Worker Assistance Program by making publicly available on at least an annual basis claims-related data, including the number of claims filed, the number of illnesses found to be related to work at a DOE facility, job location and description, and number of successful State workers&rsquo; compensation claims awarded; and</p>

L. 101&ndash;426, 42 U.S.C. 2210 note] has been or is approved by the Department of Justice, of the availability of supplemental compensation and benefits under the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) Identify and notify eligible covered uranium employees or their survivors of the availability of supplemental compensation under the Program; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) Upon request by the Secretary of Labor, provide information needed to adjudicate the claim of a covered uranium employee under this Program.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Establishment of Interagency Working Group.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) There is hereby established an Interagency Working Group to be composed of representatives from the Office of Management and Budget, the National Economic Council, and the Departments of Labor, Energy, Health and Human Services, and Justice.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Advice on additional members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health under section 7384<em>o</em> of this title <!-- PDFPage:5437 -->shall advise the President whether there is a class of employees at any Department of Energy facility who likely were exposed to radiation at that facility but for whom it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose they received.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The advice of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health under paragraph (1) shall be based on exposure assessments by radiation health professionals, information provided by the Department of Energy, and such other information as the Advisory Board considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The President shall request advice under paragraph (1) after consideration of petitions by classes of employees described in that paragraph for such advice. The President shall consider such petitions pursuant to procedures established by the President.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation of additional members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of section 7384<em>l</em>(14)(C) of this title, the members of a class of employees at a Department of Energy facility, or at an atomic weapons employer facility, may be treated as members of the Special Exposure Cohort for purposes of the compensation program if the President, upon recommendation of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health, determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is not feasible to estimate with sufficient accuracy the radiation dose that the class received; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) there is a reasonable likelihood that such radiation dose may have endangered the health of members of the class.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Deadlines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 180 days after the date on which the President receives a petition for designation as members of the Special Exposure Cohort, the Director of the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health shall submit to the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health a recommendation on that petition, including all supporting documentation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon receipt by the President of a recommendation of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health that the President should determine in the affirmative that paragraphs (1) and (2) of subsection (b) of this section apply to a class, the President shall have a period of 30 days in which to determine whether such paragraphs apply to the class and to submit that determination (whether affirmative or negative) to Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the determination submitted by the President under subparagraph (A) is in the affirmative, the President shall also submit a report meeting the requirements of section 7384<em>l</em>(14)(C)(ii) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the President does not submit a determination required by subparagraph (A) within the period required by subparagraph (A), then upon the day following the expiration of that period, it shall be deemed for purposes of section 7384<em>l</em>(14)(C)(ii) of this title that the President submitted the report under that provision on that day.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Access to information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Energy shall provide, in accordance with law, the Secretary of Health and Human Services and the members and staff of the Advisory Board on Radiation and Worker Health access to relevant information on worker exposures, including access to Restricted Data (as defined in section 2014(y) of this title.<sup><a href="#7384q_1_target" name="7384q_1">1</a></sup></p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7384r. Separate treatment of chronic silicosis</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds that employees who worked in Department of Energy test sites and later contracted chronic silicosis should also be considered for inclusion in the compensation program. Recognizing that chronic silicosis resulting from exposure to silica is not a condition unique to the nuclear weapons industry, it is not the intent of Congress with this subchapter to establish a precedent on the question of chronic silicosis as a compensable occupational disease. Consequently, it is the sense of Congress that a further determination by the President is appropriate before these workers are included in the compensation program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification by President</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A covered employee with chronic silicosis shall be treated as a covered employee (as defined in section 7384<em>l</em>(1) of this title) for the purposes of the compensation program required by section 7384d of this title unless the President submits to Congress not later than 180 days after October 30, 2000, the certification of the President that there is insufficient basis to include such employees. The President shall submit with the certification any recommendations about the compensation program with respect to covered employees with chronic silicosis as the President considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exposure to silica in the performance of duty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A covered employee shall, in the absence of substantial evidence to the contrary, be determined to have been exposed to silica in the performance of duty for the purposes of the compensation program if, and only if, the employee was present for a number of work days aggregating at least 250 work days during the mining of tunnels at a Department of Energy facility located in Nevada or Alaska for tests or experiments related to an atomic weapon.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Covered employee with chronic silicosis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;covered employee with chronic silicosis&rdquo; means a Department of Energy employee, or a Department of Energy contractor employee, with chronic silicosis who was exposed to silica in the performance of duty as determined under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5438 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Chronic silicosis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this subchapter, the term &ldquo;chronic silicosis&rdquo; means a nonmalignant lung disease if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the initial occupational exposure to silica dust preceded the onset of silicosis by at least 10 years; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a written diagnosis of silicosis is made by a medical doctor and is accompanied by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a chest radiograph, interpreted by an individual certified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as a B reader, classifying the existence of pneumoconioses of category 1/0 or higher;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) results from a computer assisted tomograph or other imaging technique that are consistent with silicosis; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this paragraph, if there is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) a surviving spouse described in subparagraph (A); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) at least one child of the covered employee who is living and a minor at the time of payment and who is not a recognized natural child or adopted child of such surviving spouse,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">then half of such payment shall be made to such surviving spouse, and the other half of such payment shall be made in equal shares to each child of the covered employee who is living and a minor at the time of payment.</p>
