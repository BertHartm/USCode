<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) some 43,000,000 Americans have one or more physical or mental disabilities, and this number is increasing as the population as a whole is growing older;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) historically, society has tended to isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities, and, despite some improvements, such forms of discrimination against individuals with disabilities continue to be a serious and pervasive social problem;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) discrimination against individuals with disabilities persists in such critical areas as employment, housing, public accommodations, education, transportation, communication, recreation, institutionalization, health services, voting, and access to public services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) unlike individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, national origin, religion, or age, individuals who have experienced discrimination on the basis of disability have often had no legal recourse to redress such discrimination;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) individuals with disabilities continually encounter various forms of discrimination, including outright intentional exclusion, the discriminatory effects of architectural, transportation, and communication barriers, overprotective rules and policies, failure to make modifications to existing facilities and practices, exclusionary qualification standards and criteria, segregation, and relegation to lesser services, programs, activities, benefits, jobs, or other opportunities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) census data, national polls, and other studies have documented that people with disabilities, as a group, occupy an inferior status in our society, and are severely disadvantaged socially, vocationally, economically, and educationally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) individuals with disabilities are a discrete and insular minority who have been faced with restrictions and limitations, subjected to a history of purposeful unequal treatment, and relegated to a position of political powerlessness in our society, based on characteristics that are beyond the control of such individuals and resulting from stereotypic assumptions not truly indicative of the individual ability of such individuals to participate in, and contribute to, society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the Nation's proper goals regarding individuals with disabilities are to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for such individuals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the continuing existence of unfair and unnecessary discrimination and prejudice denies people with disabilities the opportunity to compete on an equal basis and to pursue those opportunities for which our free society is justifiably famous, and costs the United States billions of dollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from dependency and nonproductivity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to provide a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide clear, strong, consistent, enforceable standards addressing discrimination against individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ensure that the Federal Government plays a central role in enforcing the standards established in this chapter on behalf of individuals with disabilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to invoke the sweep of congressional authority, including the power to enforce the fourteenth amendment and to regulate commerce, in order to address the major areas of discrimination faced day-to-day by people with disabilities.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Public participation</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;12185. Study</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Office of Technology Assessment shall undertake a study to determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the access needs of individuals with disabilities to over-the-road buses and over-the-road bus service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the most cost-effective methods for providing access to over-the-road buses and over-<!-- PDFPage:5753 -->the-road bus service to individuals with disabilities, particularly individuals who use wheelchairs, through all forms of boarding options.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The study shall include, at a minimum, an analysis of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The anticipated demand by individuals with disabilities for accessible over-the-road buses and over-the-road bus service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The degree to which such buses and service, including any service required under sections 12184(b)(4) and 12186(a)(2) of this title, are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The effectiveness of various methods of providing accessibility to such buses and service to individuals with disabilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The cost of providing accessible over-the-road buses and bus service to individuals with disabilities, including consideration of recent technological and cost saving developments in equipment and devices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Possible design changes in over-the-road buses that could enhance accessibility, including the installation of accessible restrooms which do not result in a loss of seating capacity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The impact of accessibility requirements on the continuation of over-the-road bus service, with particular consideration of the impact of such requirements on such service to rural communities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Advisory committee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In conducting the study required by subsection (a) of this section, the Office of Technology Assessment shall establish an advisory committee, which shall consist of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) members selected from among private operators and manufacturers of over-the-road buses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) members selected from among individuals with disabilities, particularly individuals who use wheelchairs, who are potential riders of such buses; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) members selected for their technical expertise on issues included in the study, including manufacturers of boarding assistance equipment and devices.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The number of members selected under each of paragraphs (1) and (2) shall be equal, and the total number of members selected under paragraphs (1) and (2) shall exceed the number of members selected under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deadline</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The study required by subsection (a) of this section, along with recommendations by the Office of Technology Assessment, including any policy options for legislative action, shall be submitted to the President and Congress within 36 months after July 26, 1990. If the President determines that compliance with the regulations issued pursuant to section 12186(a)(2)(B) of this title on or before the applicable deadlines specified in section 12186(a)(2)(B) of this title will result in a significant reduction in intercity over-the-road bus service, the President shall extend each such deadline by 1 year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In developing the study required by subsection (a) of this section, the Office of Technology Assessment shall provide a preliminary draft of such study to the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board established under section 792 of title 29. The Board shall have an opportunity to comment on such draft study, and any such comments by the Board made in writing within 120 days after the Board's receipt of the draft study shall be incorporated as part of the final study required to be submitted under subsection (d) of this section.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Availability of remedies and procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The remedies and procedures set forth in section 2000a&ndash;3(a) of this title are the remedies and procedures this subchapter provides to any person who is being subjected to discrimination on the basis of disability in violation of this subchapter or who has reasonable grounds for believing that such person is about to be subjected to discrimination in violation of section 12183 of this title. Nothing in this section shall require a person with a disability to engage in a futile gesture if such person has actual notice that a person or organization covered by this subchapter does not intend to comply with its provisions.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Injunctive relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of violations of sections 12182(b)(2)(A)(iv) and section&nbsp;<sup><a href="#12188_1_target" name="12188_1">1</a></sup> 12183(a) of this title, injunctive relief shall include an order to alter facilities to make such facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities to the extent required by this subchapter. Where appropriate, injunctive relief shall also include requiring the provision of an auxiliary aid or service, modification of a policy, or provision of alternative methods, to the extent required by this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Enforcement by Attorney General</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Denial of rights</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Duty to investigate</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Attorney General shall investigate alleged violations of this subchapter, and shall undertake periodic reviews of compliance of covered entities under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Attorney General certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">On the application of a State or local government, the Attorney General may, in consultation with the Architectural and Transportation Barriers Compliance Board, and after prior notice and a public hearing at which persons, including individuals with disabilities, are provided an opportunity to testify against such certification, certify that a State law or local building code or similar ordinance that establishes accessibility requirements meets or exceeds the minimum requirements of this chapter for the accessibility and usability of covered facilities under this subchapter. At any enforcement proceeding under this section, such certification by the Attorney General shall be rebuttable evidence that such State law or local ordinance does meet or exceed the minimum requirements of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Potential violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Attorney General has reasonable cause to believe that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any person or group of persons is engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination under this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any person or group of persons has been discriminated against under this subchapter and such discrimination raises an issue of general public importance,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">the Attorney General may commence a civil action in any appropriate United States district court.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority of court</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a civil action under paragraph (1)(B), the court&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) may grant any equitable relief that such court considers to be appropriate, including, to the extent required by this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) granting temporary, preliminary, or permanent relief;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) providing an auxiliary aid or service, modification of policy, practice, or procedure, or alternative method; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) making facilities readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) may award such other relief as the court considers to be appropriate, including monetary damages to persons aggrieved when requested by the Attorney General; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may, to vindicate the public interest, assess a civil penalty against the entity in an amount&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) not exceeding $50,000 for a first violation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) not exceeding $100,000 for any subsequent violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Single violation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (2)(C), in determining whether a first or subsequent violation has occurred, a determination in a single action, by judgment or settlement, that the covered entity has engaged in more than one discriminatory act shall be counted as a single violation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Punitive damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of subsection (b)(2)(B) of this section, the term &ldquo;monetary damages&rdquo; and <!-- PDFPage:5756 -->&ldquo;such other relief&rdquo; does not include punitive damages.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Judicial consideration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In a civil action under paragraph (1)(B), the court, when considering what amount of civil penalty, if any, is appropriate, shall give consideration to any good faith effort or attempt to comply with this chapter by the entity. In evaluating good faith, the court shall consider, among other factors it deems relevant, whether the entity could have reasonably anticipated the need for an appropriate type of auxiliary aid needed to accommodate the unique needs of a particular individual with a disability.</p>
