<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the supply and installation, with the approval of the owner of the residential building, in such building in a timely manner of the energy conservation measures which are as specified in the contract and which the owner or occupant was informed (pursuant to the inspection under paragraph (1)) would be supplied and installed in such building; and</p>
