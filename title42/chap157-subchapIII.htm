<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provides for the essential health benefits defined by the Secretary under subsection (b);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) limits cost-sharing for such coverage in accordance with subsection (c); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) subject to subsection (e), provides either the bronze, silver, gold, or platinum level of coverage described in subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Essential health benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall define the essential health benefits, except that such benefits shall include at least the following general categories and the items and services covered within the categories:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8118 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Ambulatory patient services.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall ensure that the scope of the essential health benefits under paragraph (1) is equal to the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer plan, as determined by the Secretary. To inform this determination, the Secretary of Labor shall conduct a survey of employer-sponsored coverage to determine the benefits typically covered by employers, including multiemployer plans, and provide a report on such survey to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In defining the essential health benefits described in paragraph (1), and in revising the benefits under paragraph (4)(H), the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress containing a certification from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that such essential health benefits meet the limitation described in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Notice and hearing</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In defining the essential health benefits under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) ensure that such essential health benefits reflect an appropriate balance among the categories described in such subsection,<sup><a href="#18022_2_target" name="18022_2">2</a></sup> so that benefits are not unduly weighted toward any category;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) not make coverage decisions, determine reimbursement rates, establish incentive programs, or design benefits in ways that discriminate against individuals because of their age, disability, or expected length of life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take into account the health care needs of diverse segments of the population, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and other groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that health benefits established as essential not be subject to denial to individuals against their wishes on the basis of the individuals&rsquo; age or expected length of life or of the individuals&rsquo; present or predicted disability, degree of medical dependency, or quality of life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) provide that a qualified health plan shall not be treated as providing coverage for the essential health benefits described in paragraph (1) unless the plan provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) coverage for emergency department services will be provided without imposing any requirement under the plan for prior authorization of services or any limitation on coverage where the provider of services does not have a contractual relationship with the plan for the providing of services that is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that apply to emergency department services received from providers who do have such a contractual relationship with the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such services are provided out-of-network, the cost-sharing requirement (expressed as a copayment amount or coinsurance rate) is the same requirement that would apply if such services were provided in-network;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) provide that if a plan described in section 18031(b)(2)(B)(ii)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18022_3_target" name="18022_3">3</a></sup> of this title (relating to stand-alone dental benefits plans) is offered through an Exchange, another health plan offered through such Exchange shall not fail to be treated as a qualified health plan solely because the plan does not offer coverage of benefits offered through the stand-alone plan that are otherwise required under paragraph (1)(J); and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18022_4_target" name="18022_4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) periodically review the essential health benefits under paragraph (1), and provide a report to Congress and the public that contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an assessment of whether enrollees are facing any difficulty accessing needed services for reasons of coverage or cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an assessment of whether the essential health benefits needs to be modified or updated to account for changes in medical evidence or scientific advancement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) information on how the essential health benefits will be modified to address any such gaps in access or changes in the evidence base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) an assessment of the potential of additional or expanded benefits to increase costs and the interactions between the addition or expansion of benefits and reductions in existing benefits to meet actuarial limitations described in paragraph (2); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) periodically update the essential health benefits under paragraph (1) to address any gaps in access to coverage or changes in the evidence base the Secretary identifies in the review conducted under subparagraph (G).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Rule of construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18022_1_target" name="18022_1">1</a></sup> shall be construed to prohibit a health plan from providing benefits in excess of the essential health benefits described in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of other coverage, twice the amount in effect under clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The amounts under clauses (i) and (ii) may be increased by the maximum amount of reimbursement which is reasonably available to a participant under a flexible spending arrangement described in section 106(c)(2) of title 26 (determined without regard to any salary reduction arrangement).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Indexing of limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any plan year beginning in a calendar year after 2014&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Actuarial value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limitation under this paragraph shall be applied in such a manner so as to not affect the actuarial value of any health plan, including a plan in the bronze level.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Coordination with preventive limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed to allow a plan to have a deductible under the plan apply to benefits described in section 2713 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 300gg&ndash;13].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cost-sharing</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Employer contributions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall issue regulations under which employer contributions to a health savings account (within the meaning of section 223 of title 26) may be taken into account in determining the level of coverage for a plan of the employer.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13535. Ensuring Enforcement and Implementation of Abortion Restrictions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13535, Mar. 24, 2010, 75 F.R. 15599, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the &ldquo;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&rdquo; (Public Law 111&ndash;148), I hereby order as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap>. 1. <em>Policy</em>. Following the recent enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), it is necessary to establish an adequate enforcement mechanism to ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), consistent with a longstanding Federal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the Hyde Amendment. The purpose of this order is to establish a comprehensive, Government-wide set of policies and procedures to achieve this goal and to make certain that all relevant actors&mdash;Federal officials, State officials (including insurance regulators) and health care providers&mdash;are aware of their responsibilities, new and old.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to the newly created health insurance exchanges. Under the Act, longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience (such as the Church Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 300a&ndash;7, and the Weldon Amendment, section 508(d)(1) of Public Law 111&ndash;8) remain intact and new protections prohibit discrimination against health care facilities and health care providers because of an unwillingness to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Numerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that these restrictions are enforced, including the De<!-- PDFPage:8123 -->partment of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Strict Compliance with Prohibitions on Abortion Funding in Health Insurance Exchanges</em>. The Act specifically prohibits the use of tax credits and cost-sharing reduction payments to pay for abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered) in the health insurance exchanges that will be operational in 2014. The Act also imposes strict payment and accounting requirements to ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion services in exchange plans (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered) and requires State health insurance commissioners to ensure that exchange plan funds are segregated by insurance companies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, OMB funds management circulars, and accounting guidance provided by the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="note-body">I hereby direct the Director of the OMB and the Secretary of HHS to develop, within 180 days of the date of this order, a model set of segregation guidelines for State health insurance commissioners to use when determining whether exchange plans are complying with the Act's segregation requirements, established in section 1303 of the Act, for enrollees receiving Federal financial assistance. The guidelines shall also offer technical information that States should follow to conduct independent regular audits of insurance companies that participate in the health insurance exchanges. In developing these model guidelines, the Director of the OMB and the Secretary of HHS shall consult with executive agencies and offices that have relevant expertise in accounting principles, including, but not limited to, the Department of the Treasury, and with the Government Accountability Office. Upon completion of those model guidelines, the Secretary of HHS should promptly initiate a rulemaking to issue regulations, which will have the force of law, to interpret the Act's segregation requirements, and shall provide guidance to State health insurance commissioners on how to comply with the model guidelines.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Community Health Center Program</em>. The Act establishes a new Community Health Center (CHC) Fund within HHS, which provides additional Federal funds for the community health center program. Existing law prohibits these centers from using Federal funds to provide abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), as a result of both the Hyde Amendment and longstanding regulations containing the Hyde language. Under the Act, the Hyde language shall apply to the authorization and appropriations of funds for Community Health Centers under section 10503 and all other relevant provisions. I hereby direct the Secretary of HHS to ensure that program administrators and recipients of Federal funds are aware of and comply with the limitations on abortion services imposed on CHCs by existing law. Such actions should include, but are not limited to, updating Grant Policy Statements that accompany CHC grants and issuing new interpretive rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>General Provisions</em>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) authority granted by law or Presidential directive to an agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees or agents, or any other person.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certifications as to benefit coverage and costs</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that the amount of the monthly premium an eligible individual is required to pay for coverage under the standard health plan for the individual and the individual's dependents does not exceed the amount of the monthly premium that the eligible individual would have been required to pay (in the rating area in which the individual resides) if the individual had enrolled in the applicable second lowest cost silver plan (as defined in section 36B(b)(3)(B) of title 26) offered to the individual through an Exchange; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that the cost-sharing an eligible individual is required to pay under the standard health plan does not exceed&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Enhanced availability</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Multiple plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State shall, to the maximum extent feasible, seek to make multiple standard health plans available to eligible individuals within a State to ensure individuals have a choice of such plans.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary determines that a State electing the application of this section meets the requirements of the program established under subsection (a), the Secretary shall transfer to the State for each fiscal year for which 1 or more standard health plans are operating within the State the amount determined under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State shall establish a trust for the deposit of the amounts received under paragraph (1) and amounts in the trust fund shall only be used to reduce the premiums and cost-sharing of, or to provide additional benefits for, eligible individuals enrolled in standard health plans within the State.

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Secretarial determination</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount determined under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the amount the Secretary determines is equal to 95 percent of the premium tax credits under section 36B of title 26, and the cost-sharing reductions under section 18071 of this title, that would have been provided for the fiscal year to eligible individuals enrolled in standard health plans in the State if such eligible individuals were allowed to enroll in qualified health plans through an Exchange established under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Specific requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall make the determination under clause (i) on a per enrollee basis and shall take into account all relevant factors necessary to determine the value of the premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that would have been provided to eligible individuals described in clause (i), including the age and income of the enrollee, whether the enrollment is for self-only or family coverage, geographic differences in average spending for health care across rating areas, the health status of the enrollee for purposes of determining risk adjustment payments and reinsurance payments that would have been made if the enrollee had enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange, and whether any reconciliation of the credit or cost-sharing reductions would have occurred if the enrollee had been so enrolled. This determination shall take into consideration the experience of other States with respect to participation in an Exchange and such credits and reductions provided to residents of the other States, with a special focus on enrollees with income below 200 percent of poverty.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in consultation with the Office of Tax Analysis of the Department of the Treasury, shall certify whether the methodology used to make determinations under this subparagraph, and such determinations, meet the requirements of clause (ii).

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Application of special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The provisions of section 18023 of this title shall apply to a State basic health program, and to standard health plans offered through such program, in the same manner as such rules apply to qualified health plans.</p>
