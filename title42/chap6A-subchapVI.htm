<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) such a loan shall be made without security or endorsement, except that if the borrower is a minor and the note or other evidence of obligation executed by him would not, under the applicable law, create a binding obligation, either security or endorsement may be required;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) no note or other evidence of any such loan may be transferred or assigned by the school making the loan except that, if the borrower transfers to another school participating in the program under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> such note or other evidence of a loan may be transferred to such other school; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Cancellation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where all or any part of a loan, or interest, is canceled under this section, the Secretary shall pay to the school an amount equal to the school's proportionate share of the canceled portion, as determined by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any loan for any year by a school from a student loan fund established pursuant to an agreement under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> shall be made in such installments as may be provided in regulations of the Secretary or such agreement and, upon notice to the Secretary by the school that any recipient of a loan is failing to maintain satisfactory standing, any or all further installments of his loan shall be withheld, as may be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Availability to eligible students in need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An agreement under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> with any school shall include provisions designed to make loans from the student loan fund established thereunder reasonably available (to the extent of the available funds in such fund) to all eligible students in the school in need thereof.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Penalty for late payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to regulations of the Secretary and in accordance with this section, a school shall assess a charge with respect to a loan from the loan fund established pursuant to an agreement under this part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#297b_1_target" name="297b_1">1</a></sup> for failure of the borrower to pay all or any part of an installment when it is due and, in the case of a borrower who is entitled to deferment of the loan under subsection (b)(2) of this section or cancellation of part or all of the loan under subsection (b)(3) of this section, for any failure to file timely and satisfactory evidence for such entitlement. No such charge may be made if the payment of such installment or the filing of such evidence is made within 60 days after the date on which such installment or filing is due. The amount of any such charge may not exceed an amount equal to 6 percent of the amount of such installment. The school may elect to add the amount of any such charge to the principal amount of the loan as of the first day after the day on which such installment or evidence was due, or to make the amount of the charge payable to the school not later than the due date of the next installment after receipt by the borrower of notice of the assessment of the charge.</p>
