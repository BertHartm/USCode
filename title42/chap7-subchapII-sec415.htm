<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Primary insurance amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The primary insurance amount of an individual shall (except as otherwise provided in this section) be equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) 90 percent of the individual's average indexed monthly earnings (determined under subsection (b) of this section) to the extent that such earnings do not exceed the amount established for purposes of this clause by subparagraph (B),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) 32 percent of the individual's average indexed monthly earnings to the extent that such earnings exceed the amount established for purposes of clause (i) but do not exceed the amount established for purposes of this clause by subparagraph (B), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 15 percent of the individual's average indexed monthly earnings to the extent that such earnings exceed the amount established for purposes of clause (ii),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">rounded, if not a multiple of $0.10, to the next lower multiple of $0.10, and thereafter increased as provided in subsection (i) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1369 --><p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) For individuals who initially become eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits, or who die (before becoming eligible for such benefits), in the calendar year 1979, the amount established for purposes of clause (i) and (ii) of subparagraph (A) shall be $180 and $1,085, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For individuals who initially become eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits, or who die (before becoming eligible for such benefits), in any calendar year after 1979, each of the amounts so established shall equal the product of the corresponding amount established with respect to the calendar year 1979 under clause (i) of this subparagraph and the quotient obtained by dividing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the national average wage index (as defined in section 409(k)(1) of this title) for the second calendar year preceding the calendar year for which the determination is made, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the national average wage index (as so defined) for 1977.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Each amount established under clause (ii) for any calendar year shall be rounded to the nearest $1, except that any amount so established which is a multiple of $0.50 but not of $1 shall be rounded to the next higher $1.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) No primary insurance amount computed under subparagraph (A) may be less than an amount equal to $11.50 multiplied by the individual's years of coverage in excess of 10, or the increased amount determined for purposes of this clause under subsection (i) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;years of coverage&rdquo; with respect to any individual means the number (not exceeding 30) equal to the sum of (I) the number (not exceeding 14 and disregarding any fraction) determined by dividing (a) the total of the wages credited to such individual (including wages deemed to be paid prior to 1951 to such individual under section 417 of this title, compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 [45 U.S.C. 228a et seq.] prior to 1951 which is creditable to such individual pursuant to this subchapter, and wages deemed to be paid prior to 1951 to such individual under section 431 of this title) for years after 1936 and before 1951 by (b) $900, plus (II) the number equal to the number of years after 1950 each of which is a computation base year (within the meaning of subsection (b)(2)(B)(ii) of this section) and in each of which he is credited with wages (including wages deemed to be paid to such individual under section 417 of this title, compensation under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1937 or 1974 [45 U.S.C. 228a et seq., 231 et seq.] which is creditable to such individual pursuant to this subchapter, and wages deemed to be paid to such individual under section 429 of this title) and self-employment income of not less than 25 percent (in the case of a year after 1950 and before 1978) of the maximum amount which (pursuant to subsection (e) of this section) may be counted for such year, or 25 percent (in the case of a year after 1977 and before 1991) or 15 percent (in the case of a year after 1990) of the maximum amount which (pursuant to subsection (e) of this section) could be counted for such year if section 430 of this title as in effect immediately prior to December 20, 1977, had remained in effect without change (except that, for purposes of subsection (b) of such section 430 of this title as so in effect, the reference to the contribution and benefit base in paragraph (1) of such subsection (b) shall be deemed a reference to an amount equal to $45,000, each reference in paragraph (2) of such subsection (b) to the average of the wages of all employees as reported to the Secretary of the Treasury shall be deemed a reference to the national average wage index (as defined in section 409(k)(1) of this title), the reference to a preceding calendar year in paragraph (2)(A) of such subsection (b) shall be deemed a reference to the calendar year before the calendar year in which the determination under subsection (a) of such section 430 of this title is made, and the reference to a calendar year in paragraph (2)(B) of such subsection (b) shall be deemed a reference to 1992).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In each calendar year the Commissioner of Social Security shall publish in the Federal Register, on or before November 1, the formula for computing benefits under this paragraph and for adjusting wages and self-employment income under subsection (b)(3) of this section in the case of an individual who becomes eligible for an old-age insurance benefit, or (if earlier) becomes eligible for a disability insurance benefit or dies, in the following year, and the national average wage index (as defined in section 409(k)(1) of this title) on which that formula is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A year shall not be counted as the year of an individual's death or eligibility for purposes of this subsection or subsection (i) of this section in any case where such individual was entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any of the 12 months immediately preceding the month of such death or eligibility (but there shall be counted instead the year of the individual's eligibility for the disability insurance benefit or benefits to which he was entitled during such 12 months).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of an individual who was entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any of the 12 months before the month in which he became entitled to an old-age insurance benefit, became reentitled to a disability insurance benefit, or died, the primary insurance amount for determining any benefit attributable to that entitlement, reentitlement, or death is the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the primary insurance amount upon which such disability insurance benefit was based, increased by the amount of each general benefit increase (as defined in subsection (i)(3) of this section), and each increase provided under subsection (i)(2) of this section, that would have applied to such primary insurance amount had the individual remained entitled to such disability insurance benefit until the month in which he became so entitled or reentitled or died, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount computed under paragraph (1)(C).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of an individual who was entitled to a disability insurance benefit for any month, and with respect to whom a primary insurance amount is required to be computed at any time after the close of the period of the individual's disability (whether because of such individual's subsequent entitlement to old-age insurance benefits or to a disability insurance <!-- PDFPage:1370 -->benefit based upon a subsequent period of disability, or because of such individual's death), the primary insurance amount so computed may in no case be less than the primary insurance amount with respect to which such former disability insurance benefit was most recently determined.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Paragraph (1) applies only to an individual who was not eligible for an old-age insurance benefit prior to January 1979 and who in that or any succeeding month&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) becomes eligible for such a benefit,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) becomes eligible for a disability insurance benefit, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) dies,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and (except for subparagraph (C)(i) thereof) it applies to every such individual except to the extent otherwise provided by paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subchapter, an individual is deemed to be eligible&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) for old-age insurance benefits, for months beginning with the month in which he attains age 62, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for disability insurance benefits, for months beginning with the month in which his period of disability began as provided under section 416(i)(2)(C) of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except as provided in paragraph (2)(A) in cases where fewer than 12 months have elapsed since the termination of a prior period of disability.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Paragraph (1) (except for subparagraph (C)(i) thereof) does not apply to the computation or recomputation of a primary insurance amount for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an individual who was eligible for a disability insurance benefit for a month prior to January 1979 unless, prior to the month in which occurs the event described in clause (i), (ii), or (iii) of paragraph (3)(A), there occurs a period of at least 12 consecutive months for which he was not entitled to a disability insurance benefit, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an individual who had wages or self-employment income credited for one or more years prior to 1979, and who was not eligible for an old-age or disability insurance benefit, and did not die, prior to January 1979, if in the year for which the computation or recomputation would be made the individual's primary insurance amount would be greater if computed or recomputed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) under this subsection as in effect in December 1978, for purposes of old-age insurance benefits in the case of an individual who becomes eligible for such benefits prior to 1984, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) as provided by subsection (d) of this section, in the case of an individual to whom such section applies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining whether an individual's primary insurance amount would be greater if computed or recomputed as provided in subparagraph (B), (I) the table of benefits in effect in December 1978, as modified by paragraph (6), shall be applied without regard to any increases in that table which may become effective (in accordance with subsection (i)(4) of this section) for years after 1978 (subject to clause (iii) of subsection (i)(2)(A) of this section) and (II) such individual's average monthly wage shall be computed as provided by subsection (b)(4) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Subject to subparagraphs (B), (C), (D) and (E), for purposes of computing the primary insurance amount (after December 1978) of an individual to whom paragraph (1) does not apply (other than an individual described in paragraph (4)(B)), this section as in effect in December 1978 shall remain in effect, except that, effective for January 1979, the dollar amount specified in paragraph (3) of this subsection shall be increased to $11.50.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to clauses (ii), (iii), and (iv), and notwithstanding any other provision of law, the primary insurance amount of any individual described in subparagraph (C) shall be, in lieu of the primary insurance amount as computed pursuant to any of the provisions referred to in subparagraph (D), the primary insurance amount computed under subsection (a) of this section as in effect in December 1978, without regard to subsections (b)(4) and (c) of this section as so in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The computation of a primary insurance amount under this subparagraph shall be subject to section 104(j)(2) of the Social Security Amendments of 1972 (relating to the number of elapsed years under subsection (b) of this section).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) An individual is described in this subparagraph if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) In applying the table of benefits in effect in December 1978 under this section for purposes of the last sentence of paragraph (4), such table, revised as provided by subsection (i) of this section, as applicable, shall be extended for average monthly wages of less than $76.00 and primary insurance benefits (as determined under subsection (d) of this section) of less than $16.20.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine and promulgate in regulations the methodology for extending the table under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7)(A) In the case of an individual whose primary insurance amount would be computed under paragraph (1) of this subsection, who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) attains age 62 after 1985 (except where he or she became entitled to a disability insurance benefit before 1986 and remained so entitled in any of the 12 months immediately preceding his or her attainment of age 62), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) would attain age 62 after 1985 and becomes eligible for a disability insurance benefit after 1985,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and who first becomes eligible after 1985 for a monthly periodic payment (including a payment determined under subparagraph (C), but excluding (I) a payment under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 or 1937 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq., 228a et seq.], (II) a payment by a social security system of a foreign country based on an agreement concluded between the United States and such foreign country pursuant to section 433 of this title, and (III) a payment based wholly on service as a member of a uniformed service (as defined in section 410(m) of this title)) which is based in whole or in part upon his or her earnings for service which did not constitute &ldquo;employment&rdquo; as defined in section 410 of this title for purposes of this subchapter (hereafter in this paragraph and in subsection (d)(3) of this section referred to as &ldquo;noncovered service&rdquo;), the primary insurance amount of that individual during his or her concurrent entitlement to such monthly periodic payment and to old-age or disability insurance benefits shall be computed or recomputed under subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If paragraph (1) of this subsection would apply to such an individual (except for subparagraph (A) of this paragraph), there shall first be computed an amount equal to the individual's primary insurance amount under paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that for purposes of such computation the percentage of the individual's average indexed monthly earnings established by subparagraph (A)(i) of paragraph (1) shall be the percent specified in clause (ii). There shall then be computed (without regard to this paragraph) a second amount, which shall be equal to the individual's primary insurance amount under paragraph (1) of this subsection, except that such second amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the portion of the monthly periodic payment which is attributable to noncovered service performed after 1956 (with such attribution being based on the proportionate number of years of such noncovered service) and to which the individual is entitled (or is deemed to be entitled) for the initial month of his or her concurrent entitlement to such monthly periodic payment and old-age or disability insurance benefits. The individual's primary insurance amount shall be the larger of the two amounts computed under this subparagraph (before the application of subsection (i) of this section) and shall be deemed to be computed under paragraph (1) of this subsection for the purpose of applying other provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), the percent specified in this clause is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) 80.0 percent with respect to individuals who become eligible (as defined in paragraph (3)(B)) for old-age insurance benefits (or became eligible as so defined for disability insurance benefits before attaining age 62) in 1986;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(IV) 50.0 percent with respect to individuals who so become eligible in 1989; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(V) 40.0 percent with respect to individuals who so become eligible in 1990 or thereafter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Any periodic payment which otherwise meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), but which is paid on other than a monthly basis, shall be allocated on a basis equivalent to a monthly payment (as determined by the Commissioner of Social Security), and such equivalent monthly payment shall constitute a monthly periodic payment for purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In the case of an individual who has elected to receive a periodic payment that has been reduced so as to provide a survivor's benefit to any other individual, the payment shall be deemed to be increased (for purposes of any computation under this paragraph or subsection (d)(3) of this section) by the amount of such reduction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;periodic payment&rdquo; includes a payment payable in a lump sum if it is a commutation of, or a substitute for, periodic payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) This paragraph shall not apply in the case of an individual who has 30 years or more of coverage. In the case of an individual who has more than 20 years of coverage but less than 30 years of coverage (as so defined), the percent specified in the applicable subdivision of subparagraph (B)(ii) shall (if such percent is smaller than the applicable percent specified in the following table) be deemed to be the applicable percent specified in the following table:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The increase shall be derived by multiplying each of the amounts described in subdivisions (I), (II), and (III) (including each of those amounts as previously increased under this subparagraph) by the applicable increase percentage; and any amount so increased that is not a multiple of $0.10 shall be decreased to the next lower multiple of $0.10. Any increase under this subsection in a primary insurance amount determined under subparagraph (C)(i) of subsection (a)(1) of this section shall be applied after the initial determination of such primary insurance amount under that subparagraph (with the amount of such increase, in the case of an individual who becomes eligible for old-age or disability insurance benefits or dies in a calendar year after 1979, being determined from the range of possible primary insurance amounts published by the Commissioner of Social Security under the last sentence of subparagraph (D)).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Whenever the Commissioner of Social Security determines that a base quarter in a calendar year is also a cost-of-living computation quarter, the Commissioner shall notify the House Committee on Ways and Means and the Senate Committee on Finance of such determination within 30 days after the close of such quarter, indicating the amount of the benefit increase to be provided, the Commissioner's estimate of the extent to which the cost of such increase would be met by an increase in the contribution and benefit base under section 430 of this title and the estimated amount of the increase in such base, the actuarial estimates of the effect of such increase, and the actuarial assumptions and methodology used in preparing such estimates.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Commissioner of Social Security shall determine and promulgate the OASDI fund ratio for the current calendar year on or before November 1 of the current calendar year, based upon the most recent data then available.

The Commissioner shall also publish in the Federal Register at that time (i) a revision of the <!-- PDFPage:1378 -->range of the primary insurance amounts which are possible after the application of this subsection based on the dollar amount specified in subparagraph (C)(i) of subsection (a)(1) of this section (with such revised primary insurance amounts constituting the increased amounts determined for purposes of such subparagraph (C)(i) under this subsection), or specified in subsection (a)(3) of this section as in effect prior to 1979, and (ii) a revision of the range of maximum family benefits which correspond to such primary insurance amounts (with such maximum benefits being effective notwithstanding section 403(a) of this title except for paragraph (3)(B) thereof (or paragraph (2) thereof as in effect prior to 1979)). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, such revision of maximum family benefits shall be subject to paragraph (6) of section 403(a) of this title (as added by section 101(a)(3) of the Social Security Disability Amendments of 1980).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;general benefit increase under this subchapter&rdquo; means an increase (other than an increase under this subsection) in all primary insurance amounts on which monthly insurance benefits under this subchapter are based.</p>

For purposes of computing primary insurance amounts and maximum family benefits (other than primary insurance amounts and maximum family benefits for individuals to whom such paragraph (4)(B) applies), the Commissioner of Social Security shall revise the table of benefits contained in subsection (a) of this section, as in effect in December 1978, in accordance with the requirements of paragraph (2)(D) of this subsection as then in effect, except that the requirement in such paragraph (2)(D) that the Commissioner of Social Security publish such revision of the table of benefits in the Federal Register shall not apply.</p>
