<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall determine ineligible for aid any family the combined value of whose resources (reduced by any obligations or debts with respect to such resources) exceeds $1,000 or such lower amount as the State may determine, but not including as a resource for purposes of this subparagraph (i) a home owned and occupied by such child, relative, or other individual and so much of the family member's ownership interest in one automobile as does not exceed such amount as the Secretary may prescribe, (ii) under regulations prescribed by the Secretary, burial plots (one for each such child, relative, and other individual), and funeral agreements&nbsp;<sup><a href="#602_1_target" name="602_1">1</a></sup> (iii) for such period or periods of time as the Secretary may prescribe, real property which the family is making a good-faith effort to dispose of, but any aid payable to the family for any such period shall be conditioned upon such disposal, and any payments of such aid for that period shall (at the time of the disposal) be considered overpayments to the extent that they would not have been made had the disposal occurred at the beginning of the period for which the payments of such aid were made, or (iv) for the month of receipt and the following month, any refund of Federal income taxes made to such family by reason of section 32 of the Internal Reve<!-- PDFPage:1168 -->nue Code of 1986 (relating to earned income credit), and any payment made to such family by an employer under section 3507 of such Code (relating to advance payment of earned income credit); and</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall enter into a contract or arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences for the study of a new national system of welfare benefits for low-income families with children, giving particular attention to what an appropriate national minimum benefit might be and how it should be calculated. The study shall give consideration to alternative minimum benefit proposals including proposals for benefits based on a family living standard, on weighted national median income, on State median income, and on the poverty level, and shall take into account the probable impact of a national minimum benefit on individuals and on State and local governments.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Methodology</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The study under this section shall include the development of a uniform national methodology which could be used to calculate State-specific family living standards and benefits based on other minimum benefit proposals.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Other Considerations; Progression to Proposed Minimum Benefit Levels</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to assess the implications of States moving to a new system of welfare benefits, the study shall include an analysis of the relationship between a State's fiscal capacity and other circumstances and constraints and the application of a full family living standard or other minimum benefit policy. The study shall propose a formula designed to achieve a uniform progression from the level of assistance currently being provided for low-income families with children under the AFDC program, the food stamp program, and the low-income energy assistance program, by each State, to a level based on the full family living standard or other minimum benefit policy for that State. For this purpose the Secretary shall define the term &lsquo;low-income families with children&rsquo; in a manner which reflects all families that include dependent children as defined for purposes of the AFDC program.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Report and Recommendations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Academy shall report its recommendations resulting from the study under this section to the Secretary no later than 24 months after the date of the enactment of this Act [Oct. 13, 1988]; and the Secretary shall promptly transmit such recommendations to the Congress.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">From the sums appropriated therefor, the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay to each State which has an approved plan for aid and services to needy families with children, for each quarter, beginning with the quarter commencing October 1, 1958&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of any State other than Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, an amount equal to the sum of the following proportions of the total amounts expended during such quarter as aid to families with dependent children under the State plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) five-sixths of such expenditures, not counting so much of any expenditure with respect to any month as exceeds the product of $18 multiplied by the total number of recipients of aid to families with dependent children for such month (which total number, for purposes of this subsection, means (i) the number of individuals with respect to whom such aid in the form of money payments is paid for such month, plus (ii) the number of individuals, not counted under clause (i), with respect to whom payments described in section 606(b)(2) of this title are made in such month and included as expenditures for purposes of this paragraph or paragraph (2)); plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Federal percentage of the amount by which such expenditures exceed the maximum which may be counted under clause (A), not counting so much of any expenditure with respect to any month as exceeds (i) the product of $32 multiplied by the total number of recipients of aid to families with dependent children (other than such aid in the form of foster care) for such month, plus (ii) the product of $100 multiplied by the total number of recipients of aid to families with dependent children in the form of foster care for such month; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of any State, 50 percent of the total amounts expended during such quarter as found necessary by the Secretary for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan, except that no payment shall be made with respect to amounts expended in connection with the provision of any service described in section 1397a(a) of this title other than services furnished pursuant to section 602(g) of this title; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">No payment shall be made under this subsection with respect to amounts paid to supplement or otherwise increase the amount of aid to families with dependent children found payable in accordance with section 602(a)(13) of this title if such amount is determined to have been paid by the State in recognition of the current or anticipated needs of a family (other than with respect to the first or first and second months of eligibility), but any such amount, if determined to have been paid by the State in recognition of the difference between the current or anticipated needs of a family for a month based upon actual income or other relevant circumstances for such month, and the needs of such family for such month based upon income and other relevant circumstances as retrospectively determined under section 602(a)(13)(A)(ii) of this title, shall not be considered income within the meaning of section 602(a)(13) of this title for the purpose of determining the amount of aid in the succeeding months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Method of computation and payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method of computing and paying such amounts shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall, prior to the beginning of each quarter, estimate the amount to be paid to the State for such quarter under the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, such estimate to be based on (A) a report filed by the State containing its estimate of the total sum to be expended in such quarter in accordance with the provisions of such subsection and stating the amount appropriated or made available by the State and its political subdivisions for such expenditures in such <!-- PDFPage:1197 -->quarter, and if such amount is less than the State's proportionate share of the total sum of such estimated expenditures, the source or sources from which the difference is expected to be derived, (B) records showing the number of dependent children in the State, and (C) such other investigation as the Secretary may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall then certify to the Secretary of the Treasury the amount so estimated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, (A) reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum by which he finds that his estimate for any prior quarter was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such quarter, (B) reduced by a sum equivalent to the pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, of the net amount recovered during any prior quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to aid to families with dependent children furnished under the State plan, and (C) reduced by such amount as is necessary to provide the &ldquo;appropriate reimbursement of the Federal Government&rdquo; that the State is required to make under section 657 of this title out of that portion of child support collections retained by it pursuant to such section; except that such increases or reductions shall not be made to the extent that such sums have been applied to make the amount certified for any prior quarter greater or less than the amount estimated by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for such prior quarter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Secretary of the Treasury shall thereupon, through the Fiscal Service of the Department of the Treasury and prior to audit or settlement by the General Accounting Office, pay to the State, at the time or times fixed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the amount so certified.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">In order to assist in obtaining the information needed to carry out subsection (b)(1) of this section and otherwise to perform his duties under this part, the Secretary shall establish uniform reporting requirements under which each State will be required periodically to furnish such information and data as the Secretary may determine to be necessary to ensure that sections 602(a)(37), 602(a)(43), and 602(g)(1)(A) of this title, are being effectively implemented, including at a minimum the average monthly number of families assisted under each such section, the types of such families, the amounts expended with respect to such families, and the length of time for which such families are assisted. The information and data so furnished with respect to families assisted under section 602(g) of this title shall be separately stated with respect to families who have earnings and those who do not, and with respect to families who are receiving aid under the State plan and those who are not.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the immediately preceding fiscal year failed to carry out the provisions of section 602(a)(15)(B) of this title as pertain to requiring the offering and arrangement for provision of family planning services; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the immediately preceding fiscal year (but, in the case of the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1972, only considering the third and fourth quarters thereof), failed to carry out the provisions of section 602(a)(15)(B) of this title with respect to any individual who, within such period or periods as the Secretary may prescribe, has been an applicant for or recipient of aid to families with dependent children under the plan of the State approved under this part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, if a State's program operated under part D of this subchapter is found as a result of a review conducted under section 652(a)(4) of this title not to have complied substantially with the requirements of such part for any quarter beginning after September 30, 1983, and the Secretary determines that the State's program is not complying substantially with such requirements at the time such finding is made, the amounts otherwise payable to the State under this part for such quarter and each subsequent quarter, prior to the first quarter throughout which the State program is found to be in substantial compliance with such requirements, shall be reduced (subject to paragraph (2)) by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) not less than one nor more than two percent, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) not less than two nor more than three percent, if the finding is the second consecutive such finding made as a result of such a review, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The reductions required under paragraph (1) shall be suspended for any quarter if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the State submits a corrective action plan, within a period prescribed by the Secretary following notice of the finding under paragraph (1), which contains steps necessary to achieve substantial compliance within a time period which the Secretary finds to be appropriate;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) A suspension of the penalty under subparagraph (A) shall continue until such time as the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) with respect to so much of such expenditures in a fiscal year as do not exceed the State's expenditures in the fiscal year 1987 with respect to which payments were made to such State from its allotment for such fiscal year pursuant to part C of this subchapter as then in effect, 90 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) with respect to so much of such expenditures in a fiscal year as exceed the amount described in clause (i)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) This paragraph may be waived by the Secretary with respect to any State which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that the characteristics of the caseload in that State make it infeasible to meet the requirements of this paragraph, and that the State is targeting other long-term or potential long-term recipients.</p>

In the case of a parent under age 25 who has not completed high school or an equivalent course of education, the State may require such parent to participate in educational activities directed at the attainment of a high school diploma (or equivalent) or another basic education program in lieu of one or more of the programs specified in the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of clause (i), an individual participating in a community work experience program under section 682 of this title shall be considered to have met the requirement of such clause if he participates for the number of hours in any month equal to the monthly payment of aid to families with dependent children to the family of which he is a member, divided by the greater of the Federal or the applicable State minimum wage (and the portion of such monthly payment for which the State is reimbursed by a child support collection shall not be taken into account in determining the number of hours that such individual may be required to work).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The requirement under subparagraph (A) shall not be considered to have been met by any State if the requirement is not met with respect to the following percentages of all families in the State eligible for aid to families with dependent children by reason of the unemployment of the parent who is the principal earner:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 60 percent, in the case of the average of each month in fiscal year 1996, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The percentage of participants for any month in a fiscal year for purposes of the preceding sentence shall equal the average of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the number of individuals described in subparagraph (A)(i) who have met the requirement prescribed therein, divided by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the total number of principal earners described in such subparagraph (but excluding those in families who have been recipients of aid for 2 months or less if, during the period <!-- PDFPage:1200 -->that the family received aid, at least one parent engaged in intensive job search).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Secretary determines that the State has failed to meet the requirement under subparagraph (A) (determined with respect to the percentages prescribed in subparagraph (B)), he may waive, in whole or in part, any penalty if he finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the State is operating a program in conformity with section 602(a)(19) of this title and part F of this subchapter,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the State has made a good faith effort to meet the requirement of subparagraph (A) but has been unable to do so because of economic conditions in the State (including significant numbers of recipients living in remote locations or isolated rural areas where the availability of work sites is severely limited), or because of rapid and substantial increases in the caseload that cannot reasonably be planned for, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the State has submitted a proposal which is likely to achieve the required percentage of participants for the subsequent fiscal years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Extension of quality control penalty moratorium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the 12-month period beginning on July 1, 1988 (in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;moratorium period&rdquo;), the Secretary shall not impose any reductions in payments to States pursuant to subsection (i) of this section (or prior regulations), or pursuant to any comparable provision of law relating to the programs under this part in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Virgin Islands, American Samoa, or the Northern Mariana Islands.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the limitation determined under paragraph (2) with respect to the State for the fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The limitation determined under this paragraph with respect to a State for any fiscal year is the amount that bears the same ratio to the amount specified in subparagraph (B) for such fiscal year as the number of children residing in the State in the second preceding fiscal year bears to the number of children residing in the United States in the second preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount specified in this subparagraph is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) $300,000,000 for fiscal year 1991;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the limitation determined under subparagraph (A) with respect to a State for a fiscal year exceeds the amount paid to the State under this subsection for the fiscal year, the limitation determined under this paragraph with respect to the State for the immediately succeeding fiscal year shall be increased by the amount of such excess.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Amounts appropriated for a fiscal year to carry out this part shall be made available for payments under this subsection for such fiscal year.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Stoppage of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any State plan for aid and services to needy families with children which has been approved by the Secretary, if the Secretary, after reasonable notice and opportunity for hearing to the State agency administering or supervising the administration of such plan, finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the plan has been so changed as to impose any residence requirement prohibited by section 602(b) of this title, or that in the administration of the plan any such prohibited requirement is imposed, with the knowledge of such State agency, in a substantial number of cases; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that in the administration of the plan there is a failure to comply substantially with any provision required by section 602(a) of this title to be included in the plan;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall notify such State agency that further payments will not be made to the State (or, in his discretion, that payments will be limited to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure) until the Secretary is satisfied that such prohibited requirement is no longer so imposed, and that there is no longer any such failure to comply. Until he is so satisfied he shall make no further payments to such State (or shall limit payments to categories under or parts of the State plan not affected by such failure).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Compliance with State statute</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment to which a State is otherwise entitled under this part for any period before September 1, 1962, shall be withheld by reason of any action taken pursuant to a State statute which requires that aid be denied under the State plan approved under this part with respect to a child because of the conditions in the home in which the child resides; nor shall any such payment be withheld for any period beginning on or after such date by reason of any action taken pursuant to such a statute if provision is otherwise made pursuant to a State statute for adequate care and assistance with respect to such child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Good faith effort to comply</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State shall be found, prior to January 1, 1977, to have failed substantially to comply with <!-- PDFPage:1209 -->the requirements of section 602(a)(27) of this title if, in the judgment of the Secretary, such State is making a good faith effort to implement the program required by such section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Reduction in amount payable</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After December 31, 1976, in the case of any State which is found to have failed substantially to comply with the requirements of section 602(a)(27) of this title, the reduction in any amount payable to such State required to be imposed under section 603(h) of this title shall be imposed in lieu of any reduction, with respect to such failure, which would otherwise be required to be imposed under this section.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">When used in this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The term &ldquo;dependent child&rdquo; means a needy child (1) who has been deprived of parental support or care by reason of the death, continued absence from the home (other than absence occasioned solely by reason of the performance of active duty in the uniformed services of the United States), or physical or mental incapacity of a parent, and who is living with his father, mother, grandfather, grandmother, brother, sister, stepfather, stepmother, stepbrother, stepsister, uncle, aunt, first cousin, nephew, or niece, in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home, and (2) who is (A) under the age of eighteen, or (B) at the option of the State, under the age of nineteen and a full-time student in a secondary school (or in the equivalent level of vocational or technical training), if, before he attains age nineteen, he may reasonably be expected to complete the program of such secondary school (or such training);</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; means money payments with respect to a dependent child or dependent children, or, at the option of the State, a pregnant woman but only if it has been medically verified that the child is expected to be born in the month such payments are made or within the three-month period following such month of payment, and who, if such child had been born and was liv<!-- PDFPage:1210 -->ing with her in the month of payment, would be eligible for aid to families with dependent children, and includes (1) money payments to meet the needs of the relative with whom any dependent child is living (and the spouse of such relative if living with him and if such relative is the child's parent and the child is a dependent child by reason of the physical or mental incapacity of a parent or is a dependent child under section 607 of this title), and (2) payments with respect to any dependent child (including payments to meet the needs of the relative, and the relative's spouse, with whom such child is living, and the needs of any other individual living in the same home if such needs are taken into account in making the determination under section 602(a)(7) of this title) which do not meet the preceding requirements of this subsection, but which would meet such requirements except that such payments are made to another individual who (as determined in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary) is interested in or concerned with the welfare of such child or relative, or are made on behalf of such child or relative directly to a person furnishing food, living accommodations, or other goods, services, or items to or for such child, relative, or other individual, but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 602 of this title includes provision for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) determination by the State agency that the relative of the child with respect to whom such payments are made has such inability to manage funds that making payments to him would be contrary to the welfare of the child and, therefore, it is necessary to provide such aid with respect to such child and relative through payments described in this clause (2);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) undertaking and continuing special efforts to develop greater ability on the part of the relative to manage funds in such manner as to protect the welfare of the family;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) periodic review by such State agency of the determination under clause (A) to ascertain whether conditions justifying such determination still exist, with provision for termination of such payments if they do not and for seeking judicial appointment of a guardian or other legal representative, as described in section 1311 of this title, if and when it appears that the need for such payments is continuing, or is likely to continue, beyond a period specified by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency on the determination referred to in clause (A) for any individual with respect to whom it is made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments with respect to a dependent child which are intended to enable the recipient to pay for specific goods, services, or items recognized by the State agency as a part of the child's need under the State plan may (in the discretion of the State or local agency administering the plan in the political subdivision) be made, pursuant to a determination referred to in clause (2)(A), in the form of checks drawn jointly to the order of the recipient and the person furnishing such goods, services, or items and negotiable only upon endorsement by both such recipient and such person; and payments so made shall be considered for all of the purposes of this part to be payments described in clause (2). Whenever payments with respect to a dependent child are made in the manner described in clause (2) (including payments described in the preceding sentence), a statement of the specific reasons for making such payments in that manner (on which the determination under clause (2)(A) was based) shall be placed in the file maintained with respect to such child by the State or local agency administering the State plan in the political subdivision. Payments of the type described in clause (2) shall not be subject to the requirements of clauses (A) through (D) of such clause (2), when they are made in the manner described in clause (2) at the request of the family member to whom payment would otherwise be made in an unrestricted manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The term &ldquo;relative with whom any dependent child is living&rdquo; means the individual who is one of the relatives specified in subsection (a) of this section and with whom such child is living (within the meaning of such subsection) in a place of residence maintained by such individual (himself or together with any one or more of the other relatives so specified) as his (or their) own home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Repealed. Pub. L. 93&ndash;647, &sect;3(a)(5), Jan. 4, 1975, 88 Stat. 2348.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The term &ldquo;emergency assistance to needy families with children&rdquo; means any of the following, furnished for a period not in excess of 30 days in any 12-month period, in the case of a needy child under the age of 21 who is (or, within such period as may be specified by the Secretary, has been) living with any of the relatives specified in subsection (a)(1) of this section in a place of residence maintained by one or more of such relatives as his or their own home, but only where such child is without available resources, the payments, care, or services involved are necessary to avoid destitution of such child or to provide living arrangements in a home for such child, and such destitution or need for living arrangements did not arise because such child or relative refused without good cause to accept employment or training for employment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) money payments, payments in kind, or such other payments as the State agency may specify with respect to, or medical care or any other type of remedial care recognized under State law (for which such individual is not entitled to medical assistance under the State plan under subchapter XIX of this chapter) on behalf of, such child or any other member of the household in which he is living, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such services as may be specified by the Secretary;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">but only with respect to a State whose State plan approved under section 602 of this title includes provision for such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Emergency assistance as authorized under paragraph (1) may be provided under the conditions specified in such paragraph to migrant workers with families in the State or in such part or parts thereof as the State shall designate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; does not mean payments with respect to a parent (or other individual whose needs such State determines <!-- PDFPage:1211 -->should be considered in determining the need of the child or relative claiming aid under the plan of such State approved under this part) of a child who fails to cooperate with any agency or official of the State in obtaining such support payments for such child. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to make an otherwise eligible child ineligible for protective payments because of the failure of such parent (or such other individual) to so cooperate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the term &ldquo;aid to families with dependent children&rdquo; does not mean any&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) amount paid to meet the needs of an unborn child; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) amount paid (or by which a payment is increased) to meet the needs of a woman occasioned by or resulting from her pregnancy, unless, as has been medically verified, the woman's child is expected to be born in the month such payments are made (or increased) or within the three-month period following such month of payment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Each dependent child, and each relative with whom such a child is living (including the spouse of such relative as described in subsection (b) of this section), who becomes ineligible for aid to families with dependent children as a result (wholly or partly) of the collection or increased collection of child or spousal support under part D of this subchapter, and who has received such aid in at least three of the six months immediately preceding the month in which such ineligibility begins, shall be deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children for purposes of subchapter XIX of this chapter for an additional four calendar months beginning with the month in which such ineligibility begins.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Applicability; time period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of determining eligibility for and the amount of benefits under a State plan approved under this part for an individual who is an alien described in clause (B) of section 602(a)(33) of this title, the income and resources of any person who (as a sponsor of such individual's entry into the United States) executed an affidavit of support or similar agreement with respect to such individual, and the income and resources of the sponsor's spouse, shall be deemed to be the unearned income and resources of such individual (in accordance with subsections (b) and (c) of this section) for a period of three years after the individual's entry into the United States, except that this section is not applicable if such individual is a dependent child and such sponsor (or such sponsor's spouse) is the parent of such child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The amount of income of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the unearned income of an alien for any month shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount of earned and unearned income of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined for such month;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the lesser of (I) 20 percent of the total of any amounts received by the sponsor and his spouse in such month as wages or salary or as net earnings from self-employment, plus the full amount of any costs incurred by them in producing self-employment income in such month, or (II) $175;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the cash needs standard established by the State under its plan for a family of the same size and composition as the sponsor and those other individuals living in the same household as the sponsor who are claimed by him as dependents for purposes of determining his Federal personal income tax liability but whose needs are not taken <!-- PDFPage:1225 -->into account in making a determination under section 602(a)(7) of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any amounts paid by the sponsor (or his spouse) to individuals not living in such household who are claimed by him as dependents for purposes of determining his Federal personal income tax liability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) any payments of alimony or child support with respect to individuals not living in such household.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of resources of a sponsor (and his spouse) which shall be deemed to be the resources of an alien for any month shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the total amount of the resources (determined as if the sponsor were applying for aid under the State plan approved under this part) of such sponsor and such sponsor's spouse (if such spouse is living with the sponsor) shall be determined; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount determined under subparagraph (A) shall be reduced by $1,500.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision of information by alien concerning his sponsor; receipt of information from Departments of State and Justice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any individual who is an alien and whose sponsor was a public or private agency shall be ineligible for aid under a State plan approved under this part during the period of three years after his or her entry into the United States, unless the State agency administering such plan determines that such sponsor either no longer exists or has become unable to meet such individual's needs; and such determination shall be made by the State agency based upon such criteria as it may specify in the State plan, and upon such documentary evidence as it may therein require. Any such individual, and any other individual who is an alien (as a condition of his or her eligibility for aid under a State plan approved under this part during the period of three years after his or her entry into the United States), shall be required to provide to the State agency administering such plan such information and documentation with respect to his sponsor as may be necessary in order for the State agency to make any determination required under this section, and to obtain any cooperation from such sponsor necessary for any such determination. Such alien shall also be required to provide to the State agency such information and documentation as it may request and which such alien or his sponsor provided in support of such alien's immigration application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall enter into agreements with the Secretary of State and the Attorney General whereby any information available to them and required in order to make any determination under this section will be provided by them to the Secretary (who may, in turn, make such information available, upon request, to a concerned State agency), and whereby the Secretary of State and Attorney General will inform any sponsor of an alien, at the time such sponsor executes an affidavit of support or similar agreement, of the requirements imposed by this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Joint and several liability of alien and sponsor for overpayment of aid during specified period following entry</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any sponsor of an alien, and such alien, shall be jointly and severally liable for an amount equal to any overpayment of aid under the State plan made to such alien during the period of three years after such alien's entry into the United States, on account of such sponsor's failure to provide correct information under the provisions of this section, except where such sponsor was without fault, or where good cause of such failure existed. Any such overpayment which is not repaid to the State or recovered in accordance with the procedures generally applicable under the State plan to the recoupment of overpayments shall be withheld from any subsequent payment to which such alien or such sponsor is entitled under any provision of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Division of income and resources of individual sponsoring two or more aliens living in same home</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case where a person is the sponsor of two or more alien individuals who are living in the same home, the income and resources of such sponsor (and his spouse), to the extent they would be deemed the income and resources of any one of such individuals under the preceding provisions of this section, shall be divided into two or more equal shares (the number of shares being the same as the number of such alien individuals) and the income and resources of each such individual shall be deemed to include one such share.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Income and resources of a sponsor (and his spouse) which are deemed under this section to be the income and resources of any alien individual in a family shall not be considered in determining the need of other family members except to the extent such income or resources are actually available to such other members.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Aliens not covered</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall not apply with respect to any alien who is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) admitted to the United States as a result of the application, prior to April 1, 1980, of the provisions of section 1153(a)(7) of title 8;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) admitted to the United States as a result of the application, after March 31, 1980, of the provisions of section 1157(c) of title 8;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) paroled into the United States as a refugee under section 1182(d)(5) of title 8;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) granted political asylum by the Attorney General under section 1158 of title 8; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a Cuban and Haitian entrant, as defined in section 501(e) of the Refugee Education Assistance Act of 1980 (Public Law 96&ndash;422).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">From the sums appropriated therefor and the allotment under this subpart, subject to the conditions set forth in this section and in section 627 of this title, the Secretary shall from time to time pay to each State that has a plan developed in accordance with section 622 of this title an amount equal to 75 per centum of the total sum expended under the plan (including the cost of administration of the plan) in meeting the costs of State, district, county, or other local child welfare services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation and method of payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The method of computing and making payments under this section shall be as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The Secretary shall, prior to the beginning of each period for which a payment is to be made, estimate the amount to be paid to the State for such period under the provisions of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) From the allotment available therefor, the Secretary shall pay the amount so estimated, reduced or increased, as the case may be, by any sum (not previously adjusted under this section) by which he finds that his estimate of the amount to be paid the State for any prior period under this section was greater or less than the amount which should have been paid to the State for such prior period under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Prohibited payments; exceptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) No payment may be made to a State under this part, for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1979, with respect to State expenditures made for (A) child day care necessary solely because of the employment, or training to prepare for employment, of a parent or other relative with whom the child involved is living, (B) foster care maintenance payments, and (C) adoption assistance payments, to the extent that the Federal payment with respect to those expenditures would exceed the total amount of the Federal payment under this part for fiscal year 1979.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Expenditures made by a State for any fiscal year which begins after September 30, 1979, for foster care maintenance payments shall be treated for purposes of making Federal payments under this part with respect to expenditures for child welfare services, as if such foster care maintenance payments constituted child welfare services of a type to which the limitation imposed by paragraph (1) does not apply; except that the amount payable to the State with respect to expenditures made for other child welfare services and for foster care maintenance payments during any such year shall not exceed 100 per centum of the amount of the expenditures made for child welfare services for which payment may be made under the limitation imposed by paragraph (1) as in effect without regard to this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Minimum State expenditures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment may be made to a State under this part in excess of the payment made under this part for fiscal year 1979, for any fiscal year beginning after September 30, 1979, if for the latter fiscal year the total of the State's expenditures for child welfare services under this part (excluding expenditures for activities specified in subsection (c)(1) of this section) is less than the total of the State's expenditures under this part (excluding expenditures for such activities) for fiscal year 1979.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A grant under this subsection shall be made only upon a finding by the Secretary that the project involved is likely to be of significant assistance in carrying out the purpose of this subsection; and with respect to such project the Secretary may waive any of the requirements of this part which would otherwise be applicable, to such extent and for such period as the Secretary determines is necessary or desirable in order to enable the State to carry out the project.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose; requirement; quarterly payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to encourage and reward State child support enforcement programs which perform in a cost-effective and efficient manner to secure support for all children who have sought assistance in securing support, whether such children reside within the State or elsewhere and whether or not they are eligible for aid to families with dependent children under a State plan approved under part A of this subchapter, and regardless of the economic circumstances of their parents, the Secretary shall, from support collected which would otherwise represent the Federal share of assistance to families of absent parents, pay to each State for each fiscal year, on a quarterly basis (as described in subsection (e) of this section) beginning with the quarter commencing October 1, 1985, an incentive payment in an amount determined under subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Incentive formula</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the incentive payment shall be equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) 6 percent of the total amount of support collected under the plan during the fiscal year in cases in which the support obligation involved is assigned to the State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) or section 671(a)(17) of this title (with such total amount for any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;AFDC collections&rdquo; for that year), plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 6 percent of the total amount of support collected during the fiscal year in all other cases under this part (with such total amount for any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;non-AFDC collections&rdquo; for that year).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If subsection (c) of this section applies with respect to a State's AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections for any fiscal year, the percent specified in paragraph (1)(A) or (B) (with respect to such collections) shall be increased to the higher percent determined under such subsection (with respect to such collections) in determining the State's incentive payment under this subsection for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The dollar amount of the portion of the State's incentive payment for any fiscal year which is determined on the basis of its non-AFDC collections under paragraph (1)(B) (after adjustment under subsection (c) of this section if applicable) shall in no case exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the dollar amount of the portion of such payment which is determined on the basis of its AFDC collections under paragraph (1)(A) (after adjustment under subsection (c) of this section if applicable) in the case of fiscal year 1986 or 1987;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 105 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1988;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) 110 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1989; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) 115 percent of such dollar amount in the case of fiscal year 1990 or any fiscal year thereafter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall make such additional payments to the State under this part, for fiscal year 1986 or 1987, as may be necessary to assure that the total amount of payments under this section and section 655(a)(1)(A) of this title for such fiscal year is no less than 80 percent of the amount that would have been payable to that State and its political subdivisions for such fiscal year under this section and section 655(a)(1)(A) of this title if those sections (including the amendment made by section 5(c)(2)(A) of the Child Support Enforcement Amendments of 1984) had remained in effect as they were in effect for fiscal year 1985.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increase in percentage; laboratory costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the total amount of a State's AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections for any fiscal year bears a ratio to the total amount expended by the State in that year for the operation of its plan approved under section 654 of this title for which payment may be made under section 655 of this title (with the total amount so expended <!-- PDFPage:1259 -->in any fiscal year being hereafter referred to in this section as the State's &ldquo;combined AFDC/non-AFDC administrative costs&rdquo; for that year) which is equal to or greater than 1.4, the relevant percent specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (b)(1) of this section (with respect to such collections) shall be increased to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 6.5 percent, plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) one-half of 1 percent for each full two-tenths by which such ratio exceeds 1.4;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that the percent so specified shall in no event be increased (for either AFDC collections or non-AFDC collections) to more than 10 percent. For purposes of the preceding sentence, laboratory costs incurred in determining paternity in any fiscal year may at the option of the State be excluded from the State's combined AFDC/non-AFDC administrative costs for that year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Support collected on behalf of individuals residing in another State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In computing incentive payments under this section, support which is collected by one State at the request of another State shall be treated as having been collected in full by each such State, and any amounts expended by the State in carrying out a special project assisted under section 655(e) of this title shall be excluded.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Estimates by Secretary; quarterly payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amounts of the incentive payments to be made to the various States under this section for any fiscal year shall be estimated by the Secretary at or before the beginning of such year on the basis of the best information available. The Secretary shall make such payments for such year, on a quarterly basis (with each quarterly payment being made no later than the beginning of the quarter involved), in the amounts so estimated, reduced or increased to the extent of any overpayments or underpayments which the Secretary determines were made under this section to the States involved for prior periods and with respect to which adjustment has not already been made under this subsection. Upon the making of any estimate by the Secretary under the preceding sentence, any appropriations available for payments under this section shall be deemed obligated.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;664. Collection of past-due support from Federal tax refunds</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procedures applicable; distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support which has been assigned to such State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) or section 671(a)(17) of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual). If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall withhold from such refunds an amount equal to the past-due support, shall concurrently send notice to such individual that the withholding has been made (including in or with such notice a notification to any other person who may have filed a joint return with such individual of the steps which such other person may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the refund), and shall pay such amount to the State agency (together with notice of the individual's home address) for distribution in accordance with section 657(b)(4) or (d)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support (as that term is defined for purposes of this paragraph under subsection (c) of this section) which such State has agreed to collect under section 654(6) of this title, and that the State agency has sent notice to such individual in accordance with paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual). If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall withhold from such refunds an amount equal to such past-due support, and shall concurrently send notice to such individual that the withholding has been made, including in or with such notice a notification to any other person who may have filed a joint return with such individual of the steps which such other person may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the refund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay the amount withheld to the State agency, and the State shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury any fee imposed by the Secretary of the Treasury to cover the costs of the withholding and any required notification. The State agency shall, subject to paragraph (3)(B), distribute such amount to or on behalf of the child to whom the support was owed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply only with respect to refunds payable under section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 after December 31, 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Prior to notifying the Secretary of the Treasury under paragraph (1) or (2) that an individual owes past-due support, the State shall send notice to such individual that a withholding will be made from any refund otherwise payable to such individual. The notice shall also (i) instruct the individual owing the past-due support of the steps which may be taken to contest the State's determination that past-due support is owed or the amount of the past-due support, and (ii) provide information, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by regulation in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, with respect to procedures to be followed, in the case of a joint return, to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to another person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that an amount should be withheld under paragraph (1) or (2), and that the refund from which it should be withheld is based upon a joint return, the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the State that the withholding is being made from a refund based upon a joint return, and shall furnish to the State the names and addresses of each taxpayer filing such joint return. In the case of a withholding under paragraph (2), the State may delay distribution of the amount withheld until the State has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that the other person filing the joint return has received his or her proper share of the refund, but such delay may not exceed six months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the other person filing the joint return with the named individual owing the past-due support takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of a refund from which a withholding was made under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay such share to such other person. The Secretary of the Treasury shall deduct the amount of such payment from amounts subsequently payable to the State agency to which the amount originally withheld from such refund was paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any case in which an amount was withheld under paragraph (1) or (2) and paid to a State, and the State subsequently determines that the amount certified as past-due support was in excess of the amount actually owed at the time the amount withheld is to be distributed to or on behalf of the child, the State shall pay the excess amount withheld to the named individual thought to have owed the past-due support (or, in the case of amounts withheld on the basis of a joint return, jointly to the parties filing such return).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations; contents, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations, approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, prescribing the time or times at which States must submit notices of past-due support, the manner in which such notices must be submitted, and the necessary information that must be contained in or accompany the notices. The regulations shall be consistent with the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section, shall specify the minimum amount of past-due support to which the offset procedure established by subsection (a) of this section may be applied, and the fee that a State must pay to reimburse the Secretary of the Treasury for the full cost of applying the offset procedure, and shall provide that the Secretary of the Treasury will advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services, not less frequently than annually, of the States which have furnished notices of past-due support under sub<!-- PDFPage:1267 -->section (a) of this section, the number of cases in each State with respect to which such notices have been furnished, the amount of support sought to be collected under this subsection by each State, and the amount of such collections actually made in the case of each State. Any fee paid to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection may be used to reimburse appropriations which bore all or part of the cost of applying such procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of withholdings made under subsection (a)(2) of this section, the regulations promulgated pursuant to this subsection shall include the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The withholding shall apply only in the case where the State determines that the amount of the past-due support which will be owed at the time the withholding is to be made, based upon the pattern of payment of support and other enforcement actions being pursued to collect the past-due support, is equal to or greater than $500. The State may limit the $500 threshold amount to amounts of past-due support accrued since the time that the State first began to enforce the child support order involved under the State plan, and may limit the application of the withholding to past-due support accrued since such time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The fee which the Secretary of the Treasury may impose to cover the costs of the withholding and notification may not exceed $25 per case submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Past-due support&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), as used in this part the term &ldquo;past-due support&rdquo; means the amount of a delinquency, determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative process established under State law, for support and maintenance of a child, or of a child and the parent with whom the child is living.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, the term &ldquo;past-due support&rdquo; means only past-due support owed to or on behalf of a qualified child (or a qualified child and the parent with whom the child is living if the same support order includes support for the child and the parent).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;qualified child&rdquo; means a child&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) who is a minor; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) who, while a minor, was determined to be disabled under subchapter II or XVI of this chapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) for whom an order of support is in force.</p>

The amount of the allotment shall be the amount necessary to comply with the order (which, if the order so provides, may include arrearages as well as amounts for current support), except that the amount of the allotment, together with any other amounts withheld for support from the wages of the member, as a percentage of his pay from the uniformed service, shall not exceed the limits prescribed in sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#665_1_target" name="665_1">1</a></sup> 1673(b) and (c) of title 15. An allotment under this subsection shall be adjusted or discontinued upon notice from the authorized person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, no action shall be taken to require an allotment from the pay and allowances of any member of one of the uniformed services under such provisions (A) until such member has had a consultation with a judge advocate of the service involved (as defined in section 801(13) of title 10), or with a law specialist (as defined in section 801(11) of such title) in the case of the Coast Guard, or with a legal officer designated by the Secretary concerned (as defined in section 101(5) of title 37) in any other case, in person, to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect to the member's support obligation and his failure to make payments thereon, or (B) until 30 days have elapsed after the notice described in the second sentence of paragraph (1) is given to the affected member in any case where it has not been possible, despite continuing good faith efforts, to arrange such a consultation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Authorized person&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section the term &ldquo;authorized person&rdquo; with respect to any member of the uniformed services means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any agent or attorney of a State having in effect a plan approved under this part who has the duty or authority under such plan to seek to recover any amounts owed by such member as child or child and spousal support (including, when authorized under the State plan, any official of a political subdivision); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the court which has authority to issue an order against such member for the support and maintenance of a child, or any agent of such court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Defense, in the case of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps, and the Secretary concerned (as defined in section 101(5) of title 37) in the case of each of the other uniformed services, shall each issue regulations applicable to allotments to be made under this section, designating the officials to whom notice of failure to make support payments, or notice to discontinue or adjust an allotment, should be given, prescribing the form and content of the notice and specifying any other rules necessary for such Secretary to implement this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;666. Requirement of statutorily prescribed procedures to improve effectiveness of child support enforcement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of procedures required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to satisfy section 654(20)(A) of this title, each State must have in effect laws requiring the use of the following procedures, consistent with this section and with regulations of the Secretary, to increase the effectiveness of the program which the State administers under this part:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Procedures described in subsection (b) of this section for the withholding from income of amounts payable as support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Procedures under which expedited processes (determined in accordance with regulations of the Secretary) are in effect under the State judicial system or under State administrative processes (A) for obtaining and enforcing support orders, and (B) for establishing paternity. The Secretary may waive the provisions of this paragraph with respect to one or more political subdivisions within the State on the basis of the effectiveness and timeliness of support order issuance and enforcement or paternity establishment within the political subdivision (in accordance with the general rule for exemptions under subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Procedures under which the State child support enforcement agency shall request, and the State shall provide, that for the purpose of enforcing a support order under any State plan approved under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any refund of State income tax which would otherwise be payable to an absent parent will be reduced, after notice has been sent to that absent parent of the proposed reduction and the procedures to be followed to contest it (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State), by the amount of any overdue support owed by such absent parent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount by which such refund is reduced shall be distributed in accordance with section 657(b)(4) or (d)(3) of this title in the case of overdue support assigned to a State pursuant to section 602(a)(26) or 671(a)(17) of this title, or, in the case of overdue support which a State has agreed to collect under section 654(6) of this title, shall be distributed, after deduction of any fees imposed by the State to cover the costs of col<!-- PDFPage:1269 -->lection, to the child or parent to whom such support is owed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notice of the absent parent's social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) and home address shall be furnished to the State agency requesting the refund offset, and to the State agency enforcing the order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Procedures under which liens are imposed against real and personal property for amounts of overdue support owed by an absent parent who resides or owns property in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A)(i) Procedures which permit the establishment of the paternity of any child at any time prior to such child's eighteenth birthday.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) As of August 16, 1984, the requirement of clause (i) shall also apply to any child for whom paternity has not yet been established and any child for whom a paternity action was brought but dismissed because a statute of limitations of less than 18 years was then in effect in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures under which the State is required (except in cases where the individual involved has been found under section 602(a)(26)(B) of this title to have good cause for refusing to cooperate) to require the child and all other parties, in a contested paternity case, to submit to genetic tests upon the request of any such party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Procedures for a simple civil process for voluntarily acknowledging paternity under which the State must provide that the rights and responsibilities of acknowledging paternity are explained and ensure that due process safeguards are afforded. Such procedures must include a hospital-based program for the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity during the period immediately before or after the birth of a child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity creates a rebuttable, or at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity, and under which such voluntary acknowledgment is admissible as evidence of paternity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Procedures under which the voluntary acknowledgment of paternity must be recognized as a basis for seeking a support order without requiring any further proceedings to establish paternity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Procedures which provide that (i) any objection to genetic testing results must be made in writing within a specified number of days before any hearing at which such results may be introduced into evidence, and (ii) if no objection is made, the test results are admissible as evidence of paternity without the need for foundation testimony or other proof of authenticity or accuracy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) Procedures which create a rebuttable or, at the option of the State, conclusive presumption of paternity upon genetic testing results indicating a threshold probability that the alleged father is the father of the child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) Procedures requiring a default order to be entered in a paternity case upon a showing of service of process on the defendent&nbsp;<sup><a href="#666_1_target" name="666_1">1</a></sup> and any additional showing required by State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Procedures which require that an absent parent give security, post a bond, or give some other guarantee to secure payment of overdue support, after notice has been sent to such absent parent of the proposed action and of the procedures to be followed to contest it (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Procedures which require the State to periodically report to consumer reporting agencies (as defined in section 1681a(f) of title 15) the name of any parent who owes overdue support and is at least 2 months delinquent in the payment of such support and the amount of such delinquency; except that (A) if the amount of the overdue support involved in any case is less than $1,000, information regarding such amount shall be made available only at the option of the State, (B) any information with respect to an absent parent shall be made available under such procedures only after notice has been sent to such absent parent of the proposed action, and such absent parent has been given a reasonable opportunity to contest the accuracy of such information (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State), and (C) such information shall not be made available to (i) a consumer reporting agency which the State determines does not have sufficient capability to systematically and timely make accurate use of such information, or (ii) an entity which has not furnished evidence satisfactory to the State that the entity is a consumer reporting agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8)(A) Procedures under which all child support orders not described in subparagraph (B) will include provision for withholding from wages, in order to assure that withholding as a means of collecting child support is available if arrearages occur without the necessity of filing application for services under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures under which all child support orders which are initially issued in the State on or after January 1, 1994, and are not being enforced under this part will include the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The wages of an absent parent shall be subject to withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, on the effective date of the order; except that such wages shall not be subject to withholding under this clause in any case where (I) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court (or administrative process) finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or (II) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section (which shall apply in the case of each absent parent against whom a support order is or has been issued or modified in the State, without regard to whether the order is being enforced under the State plan).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The requirements of paragraphs (2), (5), (6), (7), (8), (9), and (10) of subsection (b) of this section, where applicable.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1270 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Withholding from income of amounts payable as support must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Procedures which require that any payment or installment of support under any child support order, whether ordered through the State judicial system or through the expedited processes required by paragraph (2), is (on and after the date it is due)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a judgment by operation of law, with the full force, effect, and attributes of a judgment of the State, including the ability to be enforced,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) entitled as a judgment to full faith and credit in such State and in any other State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) not subject to retroactive modification by such State or by any other State;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">except that such procedures may permit modification with respect to any period during which there is pending a petition for modification, but only from the date that notice of such petition has been given, either directly or through the appropriate agent, to the obligee or (where the obligee is the petitioner) to the obligor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10)(A) Procedures to ensure that, beginning 2 years after October 13, 1988, if the State determines (pursuant to a plan indicating how and when child support orders in effect in the State are to be periodically reviewed and adjusted) that a child support order being enforced under this part should be reviewed, the State must, at the request of either parent subject to the order, or of a State child support enforcement agency, initiate a review of such order, and adjust such order, as appropriate, in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to section 667(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures to ensure that, beginning 5 years after October 13, 1988, or such earlier date as the State may select, the State must implement a process for the periodic review and adjustment of child support orders being enforced under this part under which the order is to be reviewed not later than 36 months after the establishment of the order or the most recent review, and adjusted, as appropriate, in accordance with the guidelines established pursuant to section 667(a) of this title, unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) in the case of an order with respect to an individual with respect to whom an assignment under section 602(a)(26) of this title is in effect, the State has determined, in accordance with regulations of the Secretary, that such a review would not be in the best interests of the child and neither parent has requested review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) in the case of any other order being enforced under this part, neither parent has requested review.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Procedures to ensure that the State notifies each parent subject to a child support order in effect in the State that is being enforced under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) of any review of such order, at least 30 days before the commencement of such review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) of the right of such parent under subparagraph (B) to request the State to review such order; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) of a proposed adjustment (or determination that there should be no change) in the child support award amount, and such parent is afforded not less than 30 days after such notification to initiate proceedings to challenge such adjustment (or determination).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Procedures under which a State must give full faith and credit to a determination of paternity made by any other State, whether established through voluntary acknowledgment or through administrative or judicial processes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding section 654(20)(B) of this title, the procedures which are required under paragraphs (3), (4), (6), and (7) need not be used or applied in cases where the State determines (using guidelines which are generally available within the State and which take into account the payment record of the absent parent, the availability of other remedies, and other relevant considerations) that such use or application would not carry out the purposes of this part or would be otherwise inappropriate in the circumstances.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Withholding from income of amounts payable as support</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The procedures referred to in subsection (a)(1) of this section (relating to the withholding from income of amounts payable as support) must provide for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In the case of each absent parent against whom a support order is or has been issued or modified in the State, and is being enforced under the State plan, so much of such parent's wages (as defined by the State for purposes of this section) must be withheld, in accordance with the succeeding provisions of this subsection, as is necessary to comply with the order and provide for the payment of any fee to the employer which may be required under paragraph (6)(A), up to the maximum amount permitted under section 1673(b) of title 15. If there are arrearages to be collected, amounts withheld to satisfy such arrearages, when added to the amounts withheld to pay current support and provide for the fee, may not exceed the limit permitted under such section 1673(b), but the State need not withhold up to the maximum amount permitted under such section in order to satisfy arrearages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such withholding must be provided without the necessity of any application therefor in the case of a child (whether or not eligible for aid under part A of this subchapter) with respect to whom services are already being provided under the State plan under this part, and must be provided in accordance with this subsection on the basis of an application for services under the State plan in the case of any other child in whose behalf a support order has been issued or modified in the State. In either case such withholding must occur without the need for any amendment to the support order involved or for any further action (other than those actions required under this part) by the court or other entity which issued such order.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1271 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) The wages of an absent parent shall be subject to such withholding, regardless of whether support payments by such parent are in arrears, in the case of a support order being enforced under this part that is issued or modified on or after the first day of the 25th month beginning after October 13, 1988, on the effective date of the order; except that such wages shall not be subject to such withholding under this subparagraph in any case where (i) one of the parties demonstrates, and the court (or administrative process) finds, that there is good cause not to require immediate income withholding, or (ii) a written agreement is reached between both parties which provides for an alternative arrangement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The wages of an absent parent shall become subject to such withholding, in the case of wages not subject to withholding under subparagraph (A), on the date on which the payments which the absent parent has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the date as of which the absent parent requests that such withholding begin,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the date as of which the custodial parent requests that such withholding begin, if the State determines, in accordance with such procedures and standards as it may establish, that the request should be approved, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) such earlier date as the State may select.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Such withholding must be carried out in full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State, and (subject to subparagraph (B)) the State must send advance notice to each absent parent to whom paragraph (1) applies regarding the proposed withholding and the procedures such absent parent should follow if he or she desires to contest such withholding on the grounds that withholding (including the amount to be withheld) is not proper in the case involved because of mistakes of fact. If the absent parent contests such withholding on those grounds, the State shall determine whether such withholding will actually occur, shall (within no more than 45 days after the provision of such advance notice) inform such parent of whether or not withholding will occur and (if so) of the date on which it is to begin, and shall furnish such parent with the information contained in any notice given to the employer under paragraph (6)(A) with respect to such withholding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The requirement of advance notice set forth in the first sentence of subparagraph (A) shall not apply in the case of any State which has a system of income withholding for child support purposes in effect on August 16, 1984, if such system provides on that date, and continues to provide, such procedures as may be necessary to meet the procedural due process requirements of State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Such withholding must be administered by a public agency designated by the State, and the amounts withheld must be expeditiously distributed by the State or such agency in accordance with section 657 of this title under procedures (specified by the State) adequate to document payments of support and to track and monitor such payments, except that the State may establish or permit the establishment of alternative procedures for the collection and distribution of such amounts (under the supervision of such public agency) otherwise than through such public agency so long as the entity making such collection and distribution is publicly accountable for its actions taken in carrying out such procedures, and so long as such procedures will assure prompt distribution, provide for the keeping of adequate records to document payments of support, and permit the tracking and monitoring of such payments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A)(i) The employer of any absent parent to whom paragraph (1) applies, upon being given notice as described in clause (ii), must be required to withhold from such absent parent's wages the amount specified by such notice (which may include a fee, established by the State, to be paid to the employer unless waived by such employer) and pay such amount (after deducting and retaining any portion thereof which represents the fee so established) to the appropriate agency (or other entity authorized to collect the amounts withheld under the alternative procedures described in paragraph (5)) for distribution in accordance with section 657 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The notice given to the employer shall contain only such information as may be necessary for the employer to comply with the withholding order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Methods must be established by the State to simplify the withholding process for employers to the greatest extent possible, including permitting any employer to combine all withheld amounts into a single payment to each appropriate agency or entity (with the portion thereof which is attributable to each individual employee being separately designated).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The employer must be held liable to the State for any amount which such employer fails to withhold from wages due an employee following receipt by such employer of proper notice under subparagraph (A), but such employer shall not be required to vary the normal pay and disbursement cycles in order to comply with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Provision must be made for the imposition of a fine against any employer who discharges from employment, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against any absent parent subject to wage withholding required by this subsection because of the existence of such withholding and the obligations or additional obligations which it imposes upon the employer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) Support collection under this subsection must be given priority over any other legal process under State law against the same wages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The State may take such actions as may be necessary to extend its system of withholding under this subsection so that such system will include withholding from forms of income other than wages, in order to assure that child support owed by absent parents in the State <!-- PDFPage:1272 -->will be collected without regard to the types of such absent parents&rsquo; income or the nature of their income-producing activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) The State must extend its withholding system under this subsection so that such system will include withholding from income derived within such State in cases where the applicable support orders were issued in other States, in order to assure that child support owed by absent parents in such State or any other State will be collected without regard to the residence of the child for whom the support is payable or of such child's custodial parent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Provision must be made for terminating withholding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administration of support payments through State agency or other entity</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any State may at its option, under its plan approved under section 654 of this title, establish procedures under which support payments under this part will be made through the State agency or other entity which administers the State's income withholding system in any case where either the absent parent or the custodial parent requests it, even though no arrearages in child support payments are involved and no income withholding procedures have been instituted; but in any such case an annual fee for handling and processing such payments, in an amount not exceeding the actual costs incurred by the State in connection therewith or $25, whichever is less, shall be imposed on the requesting parent by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exemption of States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If a State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary, through the presentation to the Secretary of such data pertaining to caseloads, processing times, administrative costs, and average support collections, and such other data or estimates as the Secretary may specify, that the enactment of any law or the use of any procedure or procedures required by or pursuant to this section will not increase the effectiveness and efficiency of the State child support enforcement program, the Secretary may exempt the State, subject to the Secretary's continuing review and to termination of the exemption should circumstances change, from the requirement to enact the law or use the procedure or procedures involved.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) &ldquo;Overdue support&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;overdue support&rdquo; means the amount of a delinquency pursuant to an obligation determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative process established under State law, for support and maintenance of a minor child which is owed to or on behalf of such child, or for support and maintenance of the absent parent's spouse (or former spouse) with whom the child is living if and to the extent that spousal support (with respect to such spouse or former spouse) would be included for purposes of paragraph (4) or (6) of section 654 of this title. At the option of the State, overdue support may include amounts which otherwise meet the definition in the first sentence of this subsection but which are owed to or on behalf of a child who is not a minor child. The option to include support owed to children who are not minors shall apply independently to each procedure specified under this section.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Abandoned Infants Assistance Act of 1988&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) throughout the Nation, the number of infants and young children who have been exposed to drugs taken by their mothers during pregnancy has increased dramatically;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the inability of parents who abuse drugs to provide adequate care for such infants and young children and a lack of suitable shelter homes for such infants and young children have led to the abandonment of such infants and young children in hospitals for extended periods;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) an unacceptable number of these infants and young children will be medically cleared for discharge, yet remain in hospitals as boarder babies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) hospital-based child care for these infants and young children is extremely costly and deprives them of an adequate nurturing environment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) training is inadequate for foster care personnel working with medically fragile infants and young children and infants and young children exposed to drugs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) a particularly devastating development is the increase in the number of infants and young children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (which is believed to cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome and which is commonly known as HIV) or who have been perinatally exposed to the virus or to a dangerous drug;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) many such infants and young children have at least one parent who is an intravenous drug abuser;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) such infants and young children are particularly difficult to place in foster homes, and are being abandoned in hospitals in increasing numbers by mothers dying of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or by parents incapable of providing adequate care;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) there is a need for comprehensive services for such infants and young children, including foster family care services, case management services, family support services, respite and crisis intervention services, counseling services, and group residential home services;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) there is a need to support the families of such infants and young children through the provision of services that will prevent the abandonment of the infants and children; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) there is a need for the development of funding strategies that coordinate and make the optimal use <!-- PDFPage:1276 -->of all private resources, and Federal, State, and local resources, to establish and maintain such services.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the removal from the home occurred pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement entered into by the child's parent or legal guardian, or was the result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child and (effective October 1, 1983) that reasonable efforts of the type described in section 671(a)(15) of this title have been made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such child's placement and care are the responsibility of (A) the State agency administering the State plan approved under section 671 of this title, or (B) any other public agency with whom the State agency administering or supervising the administration of the State plan approved under section 671 of this title has made an agreement which is still in effect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such child has been placed in a foster family home or child-care institution as a result of the voluntary placement agreement or judicial determination referred to in paragraph (1); and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Placements in best interest of child</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No Federal payment may be made under this part with respect to amounts expended by any State as foster care maintenance payments under this section, in the case of any child who was removed from his or her home pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement as described in subsection (a) of this section and has remained in voluntary placement for a period in excess of 180 days, unless there has been a judicial determination by a court of competent jurisdiction (within the first 180 days of such placement) to the effect that such placement is in the best interests of the child.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) &ldquo;Voluntary placement&rdquo; and &ldquo;voluntary placement agreement&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this part and part B of this subchapter, (1) the term &ldquo;voluntary placement&rdquo; means an out-of-home placement of a minor, by or with participation of a State agency, after the parents or guardians of the minor have requested the assistance of the agency and signed a voluntary placement agreement; and (2) the term &ldquo;voluntary placement agreement&rdquo; means a written agreement, binding on the parties to the agreement, between the State agency, any other agency acting on its behalf, and the parents or guardians of a minor child which specifies, at a minimum, the legal status of the child and the rights and obligations of the parents or guardians, the child, and the agency while the child is in placement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) such parents or guardians request (in such manner and form as the Secretary may prescribe) that the child be returned to their home or to the home of a relative,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the voluntary placement agreement shall be deemed to be revoked unless the State agency opposes such request and obtains a judicial determination, by a court of competent jurisdiction, that the return of the child to such home would be contrary to the child's best interests.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Aid to families with dependent children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subchapters XIX and XX of this chapter, any child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are made under this section shall be deemed to be a dependent child as defined in section 606 of this title and shall be deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children under part A of this subchapter. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to his or her minor parent, as provided in section 675(4)(B) of this title, shall be considered a child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are made under this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Agreements with adoptive parents of children with special needs; State payments; qualifying children; amount of payments; changes in circumstances; placement period prior to adoption; nonrecurring adoption expenses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Each State having a plan approved under this part shall enter into adoption assistance agreements (as defined in section 675(3) of this title) with the adoptive parents of children with special needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Under any adoption assistance agreement entered into by a State with parents who adopt a child with special needs, the State&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall make payments of nonrecurring adoption expenses incurred by or on behalf of such parents in connection with the adoption of such child, directly through the State agency or through another public or nonprofit private agency, in amounts determined under paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in any case where the child meets the requirements of paragraph (2), may make adoption assistance payments to such parents, directly through the State agency or through another public or nonprofit private agency, in amounts so determined.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(ii), a child meets the requirements of this paragraph if such child&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) at the time adoption proceedings were initiated, met the requirements of section 606(a) of this title or section 607 of this title or would have met such requirements except for his removal from the home of a relative (specified in section 606(a) of this title), either pursuant to a voluntary placement agreement with respect to which Federal payments are provided under section 674 (or 603) of this title or as a result of a judicial determination to the effect that continuation therein would be contrary to the welfare of such child,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) meets all of the requirements of subchapter XVI of this chapter with respect to eligibility for supplemental security income benefits, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to his or her minor parent as provided in section 675(4)(B) of this title,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) received aid under the State plan approved under section 602 of this title in or for the month in which such agreement was entered into or court proceedings leading to the removal of such child from the home were initiated, or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1283 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii)(I) would have received such aid in or for such month if application had been made therefor, or (II) had been living with a relative specified in section 606(a) of this title within six months prior to the month in which such agreement was entered into or such proceedings were initiated, and would have received such aid in or for such month if in such month he had been living with such a relative and application therefor had been made, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is a child described in subparagraph (A)(ii) or (A)(iii), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) has been determined by the State, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, to be a child with special needs.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The last sentence of section 672(a) of this title shall apply, for purposes of subparagraph (B), in any case where the child is an alien described in that sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of the payments to be made in any case under clauses (i) and (ii) of paragraph (1)(B) shall be determined through agreement between the adoptive parents and the State or local agency administering the program under this section, which shall take into consideration the circumstances of the adopting parents and the needs of the child being adopted, and may be readjusted periodically, with the concurrence of the adopting parents (which may be specified in the adoption assistance agreement), depending upon changes in such circumstances. However, in no case may the amount of the adoption assistance payment made under clause (ii) of paragraph (1)(B) exceed the foster care maintenance payment which would have been paid during the period if the child with respect to whom the adoption assistance payment is made had been in a foster family home.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, (A) no payment may be made to parents with respect to any child who has attained the age of eighteen (or, where the State determines that the child has a mental or physical handicap which warrants the continuation of assistance, the age of twenty-one), and (B) no payment may be made to parents with respect to any child if the State determines that the parents are no longer legally responsible for the support of the child or if the State determines that the child is no longer receiving any support from such parents. Parents who have been receiving adoption assistance payments under this section shall keep the State or local agency administering the program under this section informed of circumstances which would, pursuant to this subsection, make them ineligible for such assistance payments, or eligible for assistance payments in a different amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this part, individuals with whom a child (who has been determined by the State, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, to be a child with special needs) is placed for adoption in accordance with applicable State and local law shall be eligible for such payments, during the period of the placement, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as if such individuals had adopted such child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(i), the term &ldquo;nonrecurring adoption expenses&rdquo; means reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs and which are not incurred in violation of State or Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A State's payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses under an adoption assistance agreement shall be treated as an expenditure made for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan for purposes of section 674(a)(3)(E) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Aid to families with dependent children</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subchapters XIX and XX of this chapter, any child&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) who is a child described in subsection (a)(2) of this section, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to whom an adoption assistance agreement is in effect under this section (whether or not adoption assistance payments are provided under the agreement or are being made under this section), including any such child who has been placed for adoption in accordance with applicable State and local law (whether or not an interlocutory or other judicial decree of adoption has been issued), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are being made under section 672 of this title,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be deemed to be a dependent child as defined in section 606 of this title and shall be deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children under part A of this subchapter in the State where such child resides. For purposes of the preceding sentence, a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to his or her minor parent, as provided in section 675(4)(B) of this title, shall be considered a child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are being made under section 672 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Children with special needs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a child shall not be considered a child with special needs unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the State has determined that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his parents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the State had first determined (A) that there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or condition (such as his ethnic background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that such child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, and (B) that, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in the care of such parents as a foster child, a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;682. Establishment and operation of State programs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State plans for job opportunities and basic skills training programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) As a condition of its participation in the program of aid to families with dependent children under part A of this subchapter, each State shall establish and operate a job opportunities and basic skills training program (in this part referred to as the &ldquo;program&rdquo;) under a plan approved by the Secretary as meeting all of the requirements of this part and section 602(a)(19) of this title, and shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary, periodically (but not less frequently than every 2 years) review and update its plan and submit the updated plan for approval by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A State plan for establishing and operating the program must describe how the State intends to implement the program during the period covered by the plan, and must indicate, through cross-references to the appropriate provisions of this part and part A of this subchapter, that the program will be operated in accordance with such provisions of law. In addition, such plan must contain (i) an estimate of the number of persons to be served by the program, (ii) a description of the services to be provided within the State and the political subdivisions thereof, the needs to be addressed through the provision of such services, the extent to which such services are expected to be made available by other agencies on a nonreimbursable basis, and the extent to which such services are to be provided or funded by the program, and (iii) such additional information as the Secretary may require by regulation to enable the Secretary to determine that the State program will meet all of the requirements of this part and part A of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Labor on general plan requirements and on criteria to be used in approving State plans under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Not later than October 1, 1992, each State shall make the program available in each political subdivision of such State where it is feasible to do so, after taking into account the number of prospective participants, the local economy, and other relevant factors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If a State determines that it is not feasible to make the program available in each such subdivision, the State plan must provide appropriate justification to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The State agency that administers or supervises the administration of the State's plan approved under section 602 of this title shall be responsible for the administration or supervision of the administration of the State's program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Federal funds made available to a State for purposes of the program shall not be used to supplant non-Federal funds for existing services and activities which promote the purpose of this part. State or local funds expended for such purpose shall be maintained at least at the level of such expenditures for the fiscal year 1986.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assessment and review of needs and skills of participants; employability plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The State agency must make an initial assessment of the educational, child care, and other supportive services needs as well as the skills, prior work experience, and employability of each participant in the program under this part, including a review of the family circumstances. The agency may also review the needs of any child of the participant.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) On the basis of such assessment, the State agency, in consultation with the participant, shall develop an employability plan for the participant. The employability plan shall explain the services that will be provided by the State agency and the activities in which the participant will take part under the program, including child care and other supportive services, shall set forth an employment goal for the participant, and shall, to the maximum extent possible and consistent with this section, reflect the respective preferences of such participant. The plan must take into account the participant's supportive services needs, available program resources, and local employment opportunities. The employability plan shall not be considered a contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Following the initial assessment and review and the development of the employability <!-- PDFPage:1296 -->plan with respect to any participant in the program, the State agency may require the participant (or the adult caretaker in the family of which the participant is a member) to negotiate and enter into an agreement with the State agency that specifies such matters as the participant's obligations under the program, the duration of participation in the program, and the activities to be conducted and the services to be provided in the course of such participation. If the State agency exercises the option under the preceding sentence, the State agency must give the participant such assistance as he or she may require in reviewing and understanding the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The State agency may assign a case manager to each participant and the participant's family. The case manager so assigned must be responsible for assisting the family to obtain any services which may be needed to assure effective participation in the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Provision of program and employment information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State agency must ensure that all applicants for and recipients of aid to families with dependent children are encouraged, assisted, and required to fulfill their responsibilities to support their children by preparing for, accepting, and retaining such employment as they are capable of performing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The State agency must inform all applicants for and recipients of aid to families with dependent children of the education, employment, and training opportunities, and the support services (including child care and health coverage transition options), for which they are eligible, the obligations of the State agency, and the rights, responsibilities, and obligations of participants in the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The State agency must&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provide (directly or through arrangements with others) information on the types and locations of child care services reasonably accessible to participants in the program,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) inform participants that assistance is available to help them select appropriate child care services, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) on request, provide assistance to participants in obtaining child care services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The State agency must inform applicants for and recipients of aid to families with dependent children of the grounds for exemption from participation in the program and the consequences of refusal to participate if not exempt, and provide other appropriate information with respect to such participation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Within one month after the State agency gives a recipient of aid to families with dependent children the information described in the preceding provisions of this paragraph, the State agency must notify such recipient of the opportunity to indicate his or her desire to participate in the program, including a clear description of how to enter the program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Services and activities under program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) In carrying out the program, each State shall make available a broad range of services and activities to aid in carrying out the purpose of this part. Such services and activities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) educational activities (as appropriate), including high school or equivalent education (combined with training as needed), basic and remedial education to achieve a basic literacy level, and education for individuals with limited English proficiency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) job skills training;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) job readiness activities to help prepare participants for work; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) job development and job placement; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) must also include at least 2 of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) group and individual job search as described in subsection (g) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) on-the-job training;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(III) work supplementation programs as described in subsection (e) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(IV) community work experience programs as described in subsection (f) of this section or any other work experience program approved by the Secretary.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The State may also offer to participants under the program (i) postsecondary education in appropriate cases, and (ii) such other education, training, and employment activities as may be determined by the State and allowed by regulations of the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the State requires an individual who has attained the age of 20 years and has not earned a high school diploma (or equivalent) to participate in the program, the State agency shall include educational activities consistent with his or her employment goals as a component of the individual's participation in the program, unless the individual demonstrates a basic literacy level, or the employability plan for the individual identifies a long-term employment goal that does not require a high school diploma (or equivalent). Any other services or activities to which such a participant is assigned may not be permitted to interfere with his or her participation in an appropriate educational activity under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Secretary shall permit up to 5 States to provide services under the program, on a voluntary or mandatory basis, to non-custodial parents who are unemployed and unable to meet their child support obligations. Any State providing services to non-custodial parents pursuant to this paragraph shall evaluate the provision of such services, giving particular attention to the extent to which the provision of such services to those parents is contributing to the achievement of the purpose of this part, and shall report the results of such evaluation to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Work supplementation program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any State may institute a work supplementation program under which such State, to the extent it considers appropriate, may reserve the sums that would otherwise be payable to participants in the program as aid to families with dependent children and use such sums instead for the purpose of providing and subsidizing jobs for such participants (as described in <!-- PDFPage:1297 -->paragraph (3)(C)(i) and (ii)), as an alternative to the aid to families with dependent children that would otherwise be so payable to them.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding section 606 of this title or any other provision of law, Federal funds may be paid to a State under part A of this subchapter, subject to this subsection, with respect to expenditures incurred in operating a work supplementation program under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Nothing in this part, or in any State plan approved under part A of this subchapter, shall be construed to prevent a State from operating (on such terms and conditions and in such cases as the State may find to be necessary or appropriate) a work supplementation program in accordance with this subsection and section 684 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding section 602(a)(23) of this title or any other provision of law, a State may adjust the levels of the standards of need under the State plan as the State determines to be necessary and appropriate for carrying out a work supplementation program under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Notwithstanding section 602(a)(1) of this title or any other provision of law, a State operating a work supplementation program under this subsection may provide that the need standards in effect in those areas of the State in which such program is in operation may be different from the need standards in effect in the areas in which such program is not in operation, and such State may provide that the need standards for categories of recipients may vary among such categories to the extent the State determines to be appropriate on the basis of ability to participate in the work supplementation program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a State may make such further adjustments in the amounts of the aid to families with dependent children paid under the plan to different categories of recipients (as determined under subparagraph (D)) in order to offset increases in benefits from needs-related programs (other than the State plan approved under part A of this subchapter) as the State determines to be necessary and appropriate to further the purposes of the work supplementation program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) In determining the amounts to be reserved and used for providing and subsidizing jobs under this subsection as described in paragraph (1), the State may use a sampling methodology.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Notwithstanding section 602(a)(8) of this title or any other provision of law, a State operating a work supplementation program under this subsection (i) may reduce or eliminate the amount of earned income to be disregarded under the State plan as the State determines to be necessary and appropriate to further the purposes of the work supplementation program, and (ii) during one or more of the first 9 months of an individual's employment pursuant to a program under this section, may apply to the wages of the individual the provisions of subparagraph (A)(iv) of section 602(a)(8) of this title without regard to the provisions of subparagraph (B)(ii)(II) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A work supplementation program operated by a State under this subsection may provide that any individual who is an eligible individual (as determined under subparagraph (B)) shall take a supplemented job (as defined in subparagraph (C)) to the extent that supplemented jobs are available under the program. Payments by the State to individuals or to employers under the work supplementation program shall be treated as expenditures incurred by the State for aid to families with dependent children except as limited by paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) For purposes of this subsection, an eligible individual is an individual who is in a category which the State determines should be eligible to participate in the work supplementation program, and who would, at the time of placement in the job involved, be eligible for aid to families with dependent children under an approved State plan if such State did not have a work supplementation program in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this section, a supplemented job is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a job provided to an eligible individual by the State or local agency administering the State plan under part A of this subchapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a job provided to an eligible individual by any other employer for which all or part of the wages are paid by such State or local agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A State may provide or subsidize under the program any job which such State determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) At the option of the State, individuals who hold supplemented jobs under a State's work supplementation program shall be exempt from the retrospective budgeting requirements imposed pursuant to section 602(a)(13)(A)(ii) of this title (and the amount of the aid which is payable to the family of any such individual for any month, or which would be so payable but for the individual's participation in the work supplementation program, shall be determined on the basis of the income and other relevant circumstances in that month).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The amount of the Federal payment to a State under section 603 of this title for expenditures incurred in making payments to individuals and employers under a work supplementation program under this subsection shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount which would otherwise be payable under such section if the family of each individual employed in the program established in such State under this subsection had received the maximum amount of aid to families with dependent children payable under the State plan to such a family with no income (without regard to adjustments under paragraph (2)) for the lesser of (A) 9 months, or (B) the number of months in which such individual was employed in such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring the State or local agency administering the State plan to provide employee status to an eligible individual to whom it provides a job under the work supplementation program (or with respect to whom it provides all or part of the wages paid to the individual by another entity under such program), or as requiring any State or local agency to provide that an eligible individual filling a job position provided by another entity under such program be provided employee status by such entity during the first 13 weeks such individual fills that position.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1298 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) Wages paid under a work supplementation program shall be considered to be earned income for purposes of any provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Any State that chooses to operate a work supplementation program under this subsection shall provide that any individual who participates in such program, and any child or relative of such individual (or other individual living in the same household as such individual) who would be eligible for aid to families with dependent children under the State plan approved under part A of this subchapter if such State did not have a work supplementation program, shall be considered individuals receiving aid to families with dependent children under the State plan approved under part A of this subchapter for purposes of eligibility for medical assistance under the State plan approved under subchapter XIX of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) No individual receiving aid to families with dependent children under a State plan shall be excused by reason of the fact that such State has a work supplementation program from any requirement of this part relating to work requirements, except during periods in which such individual is employed under such work supplementation program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Community work experience program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Any State may establish a community work experience program in accordance with this subsection. The purpose of the community work experience program is to provide experience and training for individuals not otherwise able to obtain employment, in order to assist them to move into regular employment. Community work experience programs shall be designed to improve the employability of participants through actual work experience and training and to enable individuals employed under community work experience programs to move promptly into regular public or private employment. The facilities of the State public employment offices may be utilized to find employment opportunities for recipients under this program. Community work experience programs shall be limited to projects which serve a useful public purpose in fields such as health, social service, environmental protection, education, urban and rural development and redevelopment, welfare, recreation, public facilities, public safety, and day care. To the extent possible, the prior training, experience, and skills of a recipient shall be used in making appropriate work experience assignments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) A State that elects to establish a community work experience program under this subsection shall operate such program so that each participant (as determined by the State) either works or undergoes training (or both) with the maximum number of hours that any such individual may be required to work in any month being a number equal to the amount of the aid to families with dependent children payable with respect to the family of which such individual is a member under the State plan approved under this part, divided by the greater of the Federal minimum wage or the applicable State minimum wage (and the portion of a recipient's aid for which the State is reimbursed by a child support collection shall not be taken into account in determining the number of hours that such individual may be required to work).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) After an individual has been assigned to a position in a community work experience program under this subsection for 9 months, such individual may not be required to continue in that assignment unless the maximum number of hours of participation is no greater than (I) the amount of the aid to families with dependent children payable with respect to the family of which such individual is a member under the State plan approved under this part (excluding any portion of such aid for which the State is reimbursed by a child support payment), divided by (II) the higher of (a) the Federal minimum wage or the applicable State minimum wage, whichever is greater, or (b) the rate of pay for individuals employed in the same or similar occupations by the same employer at the same site.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Nothing contained in this subsection shall be construed as authorizing the payment of aid to families with dependent children as compensation for work performed, nor shall a participant be entitled to a salary or to any other work or training expense provided under any other provision of law by reason of his participation in a program under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Nothing in this part or in any State plan approved under this part shall be construed to prevent a State from operating (on such terms and conditions and in such cases as the State may find to be necessary or appropriate) a community work experience program in accordance with this subsection and subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Participants in community work experience programs under this subsection may perform work in the public interest (which otherwise meets the requirements of this subsection) for a Federal office or agency with its consent, and, notwithstanding section 1342 of title 31 or any other provision of law, such agency may accept such services, but such participants shall not be considered to be Federal employees for any purpose.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After each 6 months of an individual's participation in a community work experience program under this subsection, and at the conclusion of each assignment of the individual under such program, the State agency must provide a reassessment and revision, as appropriate, of the individual's employability plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The State agency shall provide coordination among a community work experience program operated pursuant to this subsection, any program of job search under subsection (g) of this section, and the other employment-related activities under the program established by this section so as to insure that job placement will have priority over participation in the community work experience program, and that individuals eligible to participate in more than one such program are not denied aid to families with dependent children on the grounds of failure to participate in one such program if they are actively and satisfactorily participating in another. The State agency may provide that part-time participation in more than one such program may be required where appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of any State that makes expenditures in the form described in paragraph (1) <!-- PDFPage:1299 -->under its State plan approved under subsection (a)(1) of this section, expenditures for the operation and administration of the program under this section may not include, for purposes of section 603 of this title, the cost of making or acquiring materials or equipment in connection with the work performed under a program referred to in paragraph (1) or the cost of supervision of work under such program, and may include only such other costs attributable to such programs as are permitted by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Job search program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The State agency may establish and carry out a program of job search for individuals participating in the program under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding section 602(a)(19)(B)(i) of this title, the State agency may require job search by an individual applying for or receiving aid to families with dependent children (other than an individual described in section 602(a)(19)(C) of this title who is not an individual with respect to whom section 602(a)(19)(D) of this title applies)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) subject to the next to last sentence of this paragraph, beginning at the time such individual applies for aid to families with dependent children and continuing for a period (prescribed by the State) of not more than 8 weeks (but this requirement may not be used as a reason for any delay in making a determination of an individual's eligibility for such aid or in issuing a payment to or on behalf of any individual who is otherwise eligible for such aid); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at such time or times after the close of the period prescribed under subparagraph (A) as the State agency may determine but not to exceed a total of 8 weeks in any period of 12 consecutive months.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In no event may an individual be required to participate in job search for more than 3 weeks before the State agency conducts the assessment and review with respect to such individual under subsection (b)(1)(A) of this section. Job search activities in addition to those required under the preceding provisions of this paragraph may be required only in combination with some other education, training, or employment activity which is designed to improve the individual's prospects for employment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Job search by an individual under this subsection shall in no event be treated, for any purpose, as an activity under the program if the individual has participated in such job search for 4 months out of the preceding 12 months.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Dispute resolution procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State shall establish a conciliation procedure for the resolution of disputes involving an individual's participation in the program and (if the dispute involved is not resolved through conciliation) shall provide an opportunity for a hearing with respect to the dispute, which hearing may be provided through a hearing process established for purposes of resolving disputes with respect to the program or through the provision of a hearing pursuant to section 602(a)(4) of this title; but in no event shall aid to families with dependent children be suspended, reduced, discontinued, or terminated as a result of a dispute involving an individual's participation in the program until such individual has an opportunity for a hearing that meets the standards set forth by the United States Supreme Court in Goldberg v. Kelly, 397 U.S. 254 (1970).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Special provisions relating to Indian tribes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within 6 months after October 13, 1988, an Indian tribe or Alaska Native organization may apply to the Secretary to conduct a job opportunities and basic skills training program to carry out the purpose of this subsection. If the Secretary approves such tribe's or organization's application, the maximum amount that may be paid to the State under section 603(<em>l</em>) of this title in which such tribe or organization is located shall be reduced by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2) and an amount equal to the amount of such reduction shall be paid directly to such tribe or organization (without the requirement of any nonfederal share) for the operation of such program. In determining whether to approve an application from an Alaska Native organization, the Secretary shall consider whether approval of the application would promote the efficient and nonduplicative administration of job opportunities and basic skills training programs in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of the reduction under paragraph (1) with respect to any State in which is located an Indian tribe or Alaska Native organization with an application approved under such paragraph shall be an amount equal to the amount that bears the same ratio to the maximum amount that could be paid under section 603(<em>l</em>) of this title to the State as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the number of adult Indians receiving aid to families with dependent children who reside on the reservation or within the designated service area bears to the number of all such adult recipients in the State, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the number of adult Alaska Natives receiving aid to families with dependent children who reside within the boundaries of such Alaska Native organization bears to the number of all such adult recipients in the State of Alaska.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The job opportunities and basic skills training program set forth in the application of an Indian tribe or Alaska Native organization under paragraph (1) need not meet any requirement of the program under this part or under section 602(a)(19) of this title that the Secretary determines is inappropriate with respect to such job opportunities and basic skills training program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The job opportunities and basic skills training program of any Indian tribe or Alaska Native organization may be terminated voluntarily by such tribe or Alaska Native organization or may be terminated by the Secretary upon a finding that the tribe or Alaska Native organization is not conducting such program in substantial conformity with the terms of the application approved by the Secretary, and the maximum amount that may be paid under section 603(<em>l</em>) of this title to the State within which the tribe or Alaska Native organization is located (as reduced pursuant to paragraph (1)) shall be increased by any portion of the amount retained by the Secretary with respect to such <!-- PDFPage:1300 -->program (and not payable to such tribe or Alaska Native organization for obligations already incurred). The reduction under paragraph (1) shall in no event apply to a State for any fiscal year beginning after such program is terminated if no other such program remains in operation in the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection, an Indian tribe is any tribe, band, nation, or other organized group or community of Indians that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is recognized as eligible for the special programs and services provided by the United States to Indians because of their status as Indians; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for which a reservation (as defined in paragraph (6)) exists.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For purposes of this subsection, a reservation includes Indian reservations, public domain Indian allotments, and former Indian reservations in Oklahoma.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an Alaska Native organization is any organized group of Alaska Natives eligible to operate a Federal program under Public Law 93&ndash;638 [25 U.S.C. 450 et seq.] or such group's designee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the boundaries of an Alaska Native organization shall be those of the geographical region, established pursuant to section 1606(a) of title 43, within which the Alaska Native organization is located (without regard to the ownership of the land within the boundaries);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary may approve only one application from an Alaska Native organization for each of the 12 geographical regions established pursuant to section 1606(a) of title 43; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) any Alaska Native, otherwise eligible or required to participate in a job opportunities and basic skills training program, residing within the boundaries of an Alaska Native organization whose application has been approved by the Secretary, shall be eligible to participate in the job opportunities and basic skills training program administered by such Alaska Native organization.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to grant or defer any status or powers other than those expressly granted in this subsection or to validate or invalidate any claim by Alaska Natives of sovereign authority over lands or people.</p>
