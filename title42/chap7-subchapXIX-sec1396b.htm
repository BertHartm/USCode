<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Estimates of State entitlement; installments; adjustments to reflect overpayments or underpayments; time for recovery or adjustment; uncollectable or discharged debts; obligated appropriations; disputed claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Prior to the beginning of each quarter, the Secretary shall estimate the amount to which a State will be entitled under subsections (a) and (b) of this section for such quarter, such estimates to be based on (A) a report filed by the State containing its estimate of the total sum to be expended in such quarter in accordance with the provisions of such subsections, and stating the amount appropriated or made available by the State and its political subdivisions for such expenditures in such quarter, and if such amount is less than the State's proportionate share of the total sum of such estimated expenditures, the source or sources from which the difference is expected to be derived, and (B) such other investigation as the Secretary may find necessary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary shall then pay to the State, in such installments as he may determine, the amount so estimated, reduced or in<!-- PDFPage:2850 -->creased to the extent of any overpayment or underpayment which the Secretary determines was made under this section to such State for any prior quarter and with respect to which adjustment has not already been made under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Expenditures for which payments were made to the State under subsection (a) of this section shall be treated as an overpayment to the extent that the State or local agency administering such plan has been reimbursed for such expenditures by a third party pursuant to the provisions of its plan in compliance with section 1396a(a)(25) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) For purposes of this subsection, when an overpayment is discovered, which was made by a State to a person or other entity, the State shall have a period of 60 days in which to recover or attempt to recover such overpayment before adjustment is made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment. Except as otherwise provided in subparagraph (D), the adjustment in the Federal payment shall be made at the end of the 60 days, whether or not recovery was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any case where the State is unable to recover a debt which represents an overpayment (or any portion thereof) made to a person or other entity on account of such debt having been discharged in bankruptcy or otherwise being uncollectable, no adjustment shall be made in the Federal payment to such State on account of such overpayment (or portion thereof).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The pro rata share to which the United States is equitably entitled, as determined by the Secretary, of the net amount recovered during any quarter by the State or any political subdivision thereof with respect to medical assistance furnished under the State plan shall be considered an overpayment to be adjusted under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subparagraph (A) and paragraph (2)(B) shall not apply to any amount recovered or paid to a State as part of the comprehensive settlement of November 1998 between manufacturers of tobacco products, as defined in section 5702(d) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and State Attorneys General, or as part of any individual State settlement or judgment reached in litigation initiated or pursued by a State against one or more such manufacturers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Except as provided in subsection (i)(19) of this section, a State may use amounts recovered or paid to the State as part of a comprehensive or individual settlement, or a judgment, described in clause (i) for any expenditures determined appropriate by the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Upon the making of any estimate by the Secretary under this subsection, any appropriations available for payments under this section shall be deemed obligated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In any case in which the Secretary estimates that there has been an overpayment under this section to a State on the basis of a claim by such State that has been disallowed by the Secretary under section 1316(d) of this title, and such State disputes such disallowance, the amount of the Federal payment in controversy shall, at the option of the State, be retained by such State or recovered by the Secretary pending a final determination with respect to such payment amount. If such final determination is to the effect that any amount was properly disallowed, and the State chose to retain payment of the amount in controversy, the Secretary shall offset, from any subsequent payments made to such State under this subchapter, an amount equal to the proper amount of the disallowance plus interest on such amount disallowed for the period beginning on the date such amount was disallowed and ending on the date of such final determination at a rate (determined by the Secretary) based on the average of the bond equivalent of the weekly 90-day treasury bill auction rates during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Each State (as defined in subsection (w)(7)(D) of this section) shall include, in the first report submitted under paragraph (1) after the end of each fiscal year, information related to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) provider-related donations made to the State or units of local government during such fiscal year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) health care related taxes collected by the State or such units during such fiscal year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each State shall include, in the first report submitted under paragraph (1) after the end of each fiscal year, information related to the total amount of payment adjustments made, and the amount of payment adjustments made to individual providers (by provider), under section 1396r&ndash;4(c) of this title during such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transition costs of closures or conversions permitted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State plan approved under this subchapter may include, as a cost with respect to hospital services under the plan under this subchapter, periodic expenditures made to reflect transitional allowances established with respect to a hospital closure or conversion under section 1395uu of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on Federal participation in medical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) Except as provided in paragraph (4), payment under the preceding provisions of this section shall not be made with respect to any amount expended as medical assistance in a calendar quarter, in any State, for any member of a family the annual income of which exceeds the applicable income limitation determined under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph, the applicable income limitation with respect to any family is the amount determined, in accordance with standards prescribed by the Secretary, to be equivalent to 1331/3 percent of the highest amount which would ordinarily be paid to a family of the same size without any income or resources, in the form of money payments, under the plan of the State approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary finds that the operation of a uniform maximum limits payments to families of more than one size, he may adjust the amount otherwise determined under clause (i) to take account of families of different sizes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The total amount of any applicable income limitation determined under subparagraph (B) <!-- PDFPage:2851 -->shall, if it is not a multiple of $100 or such other amount as the Secretary may prescribe, be rounded to the next higher multiple of $100 or such other amount, as the case may be.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In computing a family's income for purposes of paragraph (1), there shall be excluded any costs (whether in the form of insurance premiums or otherwise and regardless of whether such costs are reimbursed under another public program of the State or political subdivision thereof) incurred by such family for medical care or for any other type of remedial care recognized under State law or, (B) notwithstanding section 1396<em>o</em> of this title at State option, an amount paid by such family, at the family's option, to the State, provided that the amount, when combined with costs incurred in prior months, is sufficient when excluded from the family's income to reduce such family's income below the applicable income limitation described in paragraph (1). The amount of State expenditures for which medical assistance is available under subsection (a)(1) of this section will be reduced by amounts paid to the State pursuant to this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B), in the case of a family consisting of only one individual, the &ldquo;highest amount which would ordinarily be paid&rdquo; to such family under the State's plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter shall be the amount determined by the State agency (on the basis of reasonable relationship to the amounts payable under such plan to families consisting of two or more persons) to be the amount of the aid which would ordinarily be payable under such plan to a family (without any income or resources) consisting of one person if such plan provided for aid to such a family.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The limitations on payment imposed by the preceding provisions of this subsection shall not apply with respect to any amount expended by a State as medical assistance for any individual described in section 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(III), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(IV), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(V), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VI), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(i)(VII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(IX), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(X), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIV), or&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396b_2_target" name="1396b_2">2</a></sup> 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XV), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVI), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XVIII), 1396a(a)(10)(A)(ii)(XIX), 1396d(p)(1) of this title or for any individual&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) who is not receiving such aid or assistance, and with respect to whom such benefits are not being paid, but (i) is eligible to receive such aid or assistance, or to have such benefits paid with respect to him, or (ii) would be eligible to receive such aid or assistance, or to have such benefits paid with respect to him if he were not in a medical institution, or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">at the time of the provision of the medical assistance giving rise to such expenditure.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Decrease in Federal medical assistance percentage of amounts paid for services furnished under State plan after June 30, 1973</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (3), with respect to amounts paid for the following services furnished under the State plan after June 30, 1973 (other than services furnished pursuant to a contract with a health maintenance organization as defined in section 1395mm of this title or which is a qualified health maintenance organization (as defined in section 300e&ndash;9(d)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396b_3_target" name="1396b_3">3</a></sup> of this title)), the Federal medical assistance percentage shall be decreased as follows: After an individual has received inpatient hospital services or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded for 60 days or inpatient mental hospital services for 90 days (whether or not such days are consecutive), during any fiscal year, the Federal medical assistance percentage with respect to amounts paid for any such care furnished thereafter to such individual shall be decreased by a per centum thereof (determined under paragraph (5)) unless the State agency responsible for the administration of the plan makes a showing satisfactory to the Secretary that, with respect to each calendar quarter for which the State submits a request for payment at the full Federal medical assistance percentage for amounts paid for inpatient hospital services or services in an intermediate care facility for the mentally retarded furnished beyond 60 days (or inpatient mental hospital services furnished beyond 90 days), such State has an effective program of medical review of the care of patients in mental hospitals and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded pursuant to paragraphs (26) and (31) of section 1396a(a) of this title whereby the professional management of each case is reviewed and evaluated at least annually by independent professional review teams. In determining the number of days on which an individual has received services described in this subsection, there shall not be counted any days with respect to which such individual is entitled to have payments made (in whole or in part) on his behalf under section 1395d of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall, as part of his validation procedures under this subsection, conduct timely sample onsite surveys of private and public institutions in which recipients of medical <!-- PDFPage:2852 -->assistance may receive care and services under a State plan approved under this subchapter, and his findings with respect to such surveys (as well as the showings of the State agency required under this subsection) shall be made available for public inspection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) No reduction in the Federal medical assistance percentage of a State otherwise required to be imposed under this subsection shall take effect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) if such reduction is due to the State's unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a calendar quarter beginning before January 1, 1977;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) before January 1, 1978;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) unless a notice of such reduction has been provided to the State at least 30 days before the date such reduction takes effect; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) due to the State's unsatisfactory or invalid showing made with respect to a calendar quarter beginning after September 30, 1977, unless notice of such reduction has been provided to the State no later than the first day of the fourth calendar quarter following the calendar quarter with respect to which such showing was made.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall waive application of any reduction in the Federal medical assistance percentage of a State otherwise required to be imposed under paragraph (1) because a showing by the State, made under such paragraph with respect to a calendar quarter ending after January 1, 1977, and before January 1, 1978, is determined to be either unsatisfactory under such paragraph or invalid under paragraph (2), if the Secretary determines that the State's showing made under paragraph (1) with respect to any calendar quarter ending on or before December 31, 1978, is satisfactory under such paragraph and is valid under paragraph (2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Secretary may not find the showing of a State, with respect to a calendar quarter under paragraph (1), to be satisfactory if the showing is submitted to the Secretary later than the 30th day after the last day of the calendar quarter, unless the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary good cause for not meeting such deadline.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall find a showing of a State, with respect to a calendar quarter under paragraph (1), to be satisfactory under such paragraph with respect to the requirement that the State conduct annual onsite inspections in mental hospitals and intermediate care facilities for the mentally retarded under paragraphs (26) and (31) of section 1396a(a) of this title, if the showing demonstrates that the State has conducted such an onsite inspection during the 12-month period ending on the last date of the calendar quarter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) in each of not less than 98 per centum of the number of such hospitals and facilities requiring such inspection, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) in every such hospital or facility which has 200 or more beds,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and that, with respect to such hospitals and facilities not inspected within such period, the State has exercised good faith and due diligence in attempting to conduct such inspection, or if the State demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Secretary that it would have made such a showing but for failings of a technical nature only.</p>
