<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (B), items and services within a group shall not be treated as &ldquo;comparable with respect to the use of resources&rdquo; if the highest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary under subparagraph (C)) for an item or service within the group is more than 2 times greater than the lowest median cost (or mean cost, if so elected) for an item or service within the group; except that the Secretary may make exceptions in unusual cases, such as low volume items and services, but may not make such an exception in the case of a drug or biological that has been designated as an orphan drug under section 360bb of title 21.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Calculation of base amounts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Aggregate amounts that would be payable if deductibles were disregarded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall estimate the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total amounts that would be payable from the Trust Fund under this part for covered OPD services in 1999, determined without regard to this subsection, as though the deductible under subsection (b) of this section did not apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total amounts of copayments estimated to be paid under this subsection by beneficiaries to hospitals for covered OPD services in 1999, as though the deductible under subsection (b) of this section did not apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Unadjusted copayment amount</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subsection, subject to clause (ii), the &ldquo;unadjusted copayment amount&rdquo; applicable to a covered OPD service (or group of such services) is 20 percent of the national median of the charges for the service (or services within the group) furnished during 1996, updated to 1999 using the Secretary's estimate of charge growth during the period.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjusted to be 20 percent when fully phased in</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year would be equal to or exceed 80 percent, then the unadjusted copayment amount shall be 20 percent of amount determined under subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Rules for new services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall establish rules for establishment of an unadjusted copayment amount for a covered OPD service not furnished during 1996, based upon its classification within a group of such services.</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) For 1999</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary shall establish a 1999 conversion factor for determining the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in 1999. Such conversion factor shall be established on the basis of the weights and frequencies described in paragraph (2)(C) and in such a manner that the sum for all services and groups of the products (described in <!-- PDFPage:2491 -->subclause (II) for each such service or group) equals the total projected amount described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Product described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary shall determine for each service or group the product of the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts (taking into account appropriate adjustments described in paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E)) and the estimated frequencies for such service or group.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Subsequent years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to paragraph (8)(B), the Secretary shall establish a conversion factor for covered OPD services furnished in subsequent years in an amount equal to the conversion factor established under this subparagraph and applicable to such services furnished in the previous year increased by the OPD fee schedule increase factor specified under clause (iv) for the year involved.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustment for service mix changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments for service mix under paragraph (2) for a previous year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of covered OPD services that do not reflect real changes in service mix, the Secretary may adjust the conversion factor computed under this subparagraph for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) OPD fee schedule increase factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, subject to paragraph (17) and subparagraph (F) of this paragraph, the &ldquo;OPD fee schedule increase factor&rdquo; for services furnished in a year is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title to hospital discharges occurring during the fiscal year ending in such year, reduced by 1 percentage point for such factor for services furnished in each of 2000 and 2002. In applying the previous sentence for years beginning with 2000, the Secretary may substitute for the market basket percentage increase an annual percentage increase that is computed and applied with respect to covered OPD services furnished in a year in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase is determined and applied to inpatient hospital services for discharges occurring in a fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Calculation of medicare OPD fee schedule amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute a medicare OPD fee schedule amount for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year, in an amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the relative payment weight (determined under paragraph (2)(C)) for the service or group.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Pre-deductible payment percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year is equal to the ratio of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for each of 2010 through 2019, by the adjustment described in subparagraph (G).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The application of this subparagraph may result in the increase factor under subparagraph (C)(iv) being less than 0.0 for a year, and may result in payment rates under the payment system under this subsection for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Other adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of subparagraph (F)(ii), the adjustment described in this subparagraph is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for each of 2010 and 2011, 0.25 percentage point;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for each of 2012 and 2013, 0.1 percentage point;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for 2014, 0.3 percentage point;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Medicare payment amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of payment made from the Trust Fund under this part for a covered OPD service (and such services classified within a group) furnished in a year is determined, subject to paragraph (7), as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Fee schedule adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The medicare OPD fee schedule amount (computed under paragraph (3)(D)) for the service or group and year is adjusted for relative differences in the cost of labor and other factors determined by the Secretary, as computed under paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Subtract applicable deductible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Reduce the adjusted amount determined under subparagraph (A) by the amount of the deductible under subsection (b) of this section, to the extent applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Apply payment proportion to remainder</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of payment is the amount so determined under subparagraph (B) multi<!-- PDFPage:2492 -->plied by the pre-deductible payment percentage (as determined under paragraph (3)(E)) for the service or group and year involved, plus the amount of any reduction in the copayment amount attributable to paragraph (8)(C).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;provider of services&rdquo; shall include a clinic, rehabilitation agency, or public health agency if, in the case of a clinic or rehabilitation agency, such clinic or agency meets the requirements of section 1395x(p)(4)(A) of this title (or meets the requirements of such section through the operation of subsection (g) or (<em>ll</em>)(2) of section 1395x of this title), or if, in the case of a public health agency, such agency meets the requirements of section 1395x(p)(4)(B) of this title (or meets the requirements of such section through the operation of subsection (g) or (<em>ll</em>)(2) of section 1395x of this title), but only with respect to the furnishing of outpatient physical therapy services (as therein defined) or (through the operation of subsection (g) or (<em>ll</em>)(2) of section 1395x of this title) with respect to the furnishing of outpatient occupational therapy services or outpatient speech-language pathology services, respectively.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent provided by regulations, the certification and recertification requirements of paragraph (2) shall be deemed satisfied where, at a later date, a physician makes a certification of the kind provided in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) (whichever would have applied), but only where such certification is accompanied by such medical and other evidence as may be required by such regulations. With respect to the physician certification required by paragraph (2) for home health services furnished to any individual by a home health agency (other than an agency which is a governmental entity) and with respect to the establishment and review of a plan for such services, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which shall become effective no later than July 1, 1981, and which prohibit a physician who has a significant ownership interest in, or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, such home health agency from performing such certification and from establishing or reviewing such plan, except that such prohibition shall not apply with respect to a home health agency which is a sole community home health agency (as determined by the Secretary). For purposes of the preceding sentence, service by a physician as an uncompensated officer or director of a home health agency shall not constitute having a significant ownership interest in, or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, such agency. For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), an individual shall be considered to be &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo; if the individual has a condition, due to an illness or injury, that restricts the ability of the individual to leave his or her home except with the assistance of another individual <!-- PDFPage:2577 -->or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker), or if the individual has a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated. While an individual does not have to be bedridden to be considered &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo;, the condition of the individual should be such that there exists a normal inability to leave home and that leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort by the individual. Any absence of an individual from the home attributable to the need to receive health care treatment, including regular absences for the purpose of participating in therapeutic, psychosocial, or medical treatment in an adult day-care program that is licensed or certified by a State, or accredited, to furnish adult day-care services in the State shall not disqualify an individual from being considered to be &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo;. Any other absence of an individual from the home shall not so disqualify an individual if the absence is of infrequent or of relatively short duration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any absence for the purpose of attending a religious service shall be deemed to be an absence of infrequent or short duration. In applying paragraph (1), the Secretary may specify exceptions to the 1 calendar year period specified in such paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions for payment for services described in section 1395x(s) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payment may also be made to any hospital for services described in section 1395x(s) of this title furnished as an outpatient service by a hospital or by others under arrangements made by it to an individual entitled to benefits under this part even though such hospital does not have an agreement in effect under this subchapter if (A) such services were emergency services, (B) the Secretary would be required to make such payment if the hospital had such an agreement in effect and otherwise met the conditions of payment hereunder, and (C) such hospital has made an election pursuant to section 1395f(d)(1)(C) of this title with respect to the calendar year in which such emergency services are provided. Such payments shall be made only in the amounts provided under section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(2) of this title and then only if such hospital agrees to comply, with respect to the emergency services provided, with the provisions of section 1395cc(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payment may also be made on the basis of an itemized bill to an individual for services described in paragraph (1) of this subsection if (A) payment cannot be made under such paragraph (1) solely because the hospital does not elect, in accordance with section 1395f(d)(1)(C) of this title, to claim such payments and (B) such individual files application (submitted within such time and in such form and manner, and containing and supported by such information as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) for reimbursement. The amounts payable under this paragraph shall, subject to the provisions of section 1395<em>l</em> of this title, be equal to 80 percent of the hospital's reasonable charges for such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Collection of charges from individuals for services specified in section 1395x(s) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and sections 1395k, 1395<em>l</em>, and 1395cc(a)(1)(A) of this title, a hospital or a critical access hospital may, subject to such limitations as may be prescribed by regulations, collect from an individual the customary charges for services specified in section 1395x(s) of this title and furnished to him by such hospital as an outpatient, but only if such charges for such services do not exceed the applicable supplementary medical insurance deductible, and such customary charges shall be regarded as expenses incurred by such individual with respect to which benefits are payable in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(1) of this title. Payments under this subchapter to hospitals which have elected to make collections from individuals in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be adjusted periodically to place the hospital in the same position it would have been had it instead been reimbursed in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(2) of this title (or, in the case of a critical access hospital, in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(6) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment to Federal provider of services or other Federal agencies prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 1395qq of this title, no payment may be made under this part to any Federal provider of services or other Federal agency, except a provider of services which the Secretary determines is providing services to the public generally as a community institution or agency; and no such payment may be made to any provider of services or other person for any item or service which such provider or person is obligated by a law of, or a contract with, the United States to render at public expense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment to fund designated by medical staff or faculty of medical school</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of services (1) which are inpatient hospital services by reason of paragraph (7) of section 1395x(b) of this title or for which entitlement exists by reason of clause (II) of section 1395k(a)(2)(B)(i) of this title, and (2) for which the reasonable cost thereof is determined under section 1395x(v)(1)(D) of this title (or would be if section 1395ww of this title did not apply), payment under this part shall be made to such fund as may be designated by the organized medical staff of the hospital in which such services were furnished or, if such services were furnished in such hospital by the faculty of a medical school, to such fund as may be designated by such faculty, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such hospital has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1395cc of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary has received written assurances that (i) such payment will be used by such fund solely for the improvement of care to patients in such hospital or for educational or charitable purposes and (ii) the individuals who were furnished such services or any other persons will not be charged for such services (or if charged provision will be made for return of any moneys incorrectly collected).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of monthly actuarial rates and premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, during September of 1983 and of each year thereafter, determine the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over which shall be applicable for the succeeding calendar year. Such actuarial rate shall be the amount the Secretary estimates to be necessary so that the aggregate amount for such calendar year with respect to those enrollees age 65 and older will equal one-half of the total of the benefits and administrative costs which he estimates will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for services performed and related administrative costs incurred in such calendar year with respect to such enrollees. In calculating the monthly actuarial rate, the Secretary shall include an appropriate amount for a contingency margin. In applying this paragraph there shall not be taken into account additional payments under section 1395w&ndash;4(<em>o</em>) of this title and section 1395w&ndash;23(<em>l</em>)(3) of this title and the Government contribution under section 1395w(a)(3) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The monthly premium of each individual enrolled under this part for each month after December 1983 shall be the amount determined under paragraph (3), adjusted as required in accordance with subsections (b), (c), (f), and (i) of this section, and to reflect any credit provided under section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(1)(C)(ii)(III) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary, during September of each year, shall determine and promulgate a monthly premium rate for the succeeding calendar year that (except as provided in subsection (g) of this section) is equal to 50 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over, determined according to paragraph (1), for that succeeding calendar year. Whenever the Secretary promulgates the dollar amount which shall be applicable as the monthly premium rate for any period, he shall, at the time such promulgation is announced, issue a public statement setting forth the actuarial assumptions and bases employed by him in arriving at the amount of an adequate actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and older as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall also, during September of 1983 and of each year thereafter, determine the monthly actuarial rate for disabled enrollees under age 65 which shall be applicable for the succeeding calendar year. Such actuarial rate shall be the amount the Secretary estimates to be necessary so that the aggregate amount for such calendar year with respect to disabled enrollees under age 65 will equal one-half of the total of the benefits and administrative costs which he estimates will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for services performed and related administrative costs incurred in such calendar year with respect to such enrollees. In calculating the monthly actuarial rate under this paragraph, the Secretary shall include an appropriate amount for a contingency margin.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Increase in monthly premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual whose coverage period began pursuant to an enrollment after his initial enrollment period (determined pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of section 1395p of this title) and not pursuant to a special enrollment period under subsection (i)(4) or (<em>l</em>) of section 1395p of this title, the monthly premium determined under subsection (a) of this section (without regard to any adjustment under subsection (i) of this section) shall be increased by 10 percent of the monthly premium so determined for each full 12 months (in the same continuous period of eligibility) in which he could have been but was not enrolled. For purposes of the preceding sentence, there shall be taken into account (1) the months which elapsed between the close of his initial enrollment period and the close of the enrollment period in which he enrolled, plus (in the case of an individual who reenrolls) (2) the months which elapsed between the date of termination of a previous coverage period and the close of the enrollment period in which he reenrolled, but there shall not be taken into account months for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was enrolled in a group health plan described in section 1395y(b)(1)(A)(v) of this title by reason of the individual's (or the individual's spouse's) current employment status or months during which the individual has not attained the age of 65 and for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was enrolled in a large group health plan (as that term is defined in section 1395y(b)(1)(B)(iii) of this title) by reason of the individual's current employment status (or the current employment status of a family member of the individual) or months for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was an individual described in section 1395p(k)(3) of this title. Any increase in an individual's monthly premium under the first sentence of this subsection with respect to a particular continuous period of eligibility shall not be applicable with respect to any other continuous period of eligibility which such individual may have. No increase in the premium shall be effected for a month in the case of an individual who enrolls under this part during 2001, 2002, 2003, or 2004 and who demonstrates to the Secretary before December 31, 2004, that the individual is a covered beneficiary (as defined in section 1072(5) of title 10). The Secretary of Health and Human Services shall consult with the Secretary of Defense in identifying individuals described in the previous sentence.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premiums rounded to nearest multiple of ten cents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any monthly premium determined under the foregoing provisions of this section is not a multiple of 10 cents, such premium shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 cents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Continuous period of eligibility&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (b) of this section (and section 1395p(g)(1) of this title), an individual's &ldquo;continuous period of eligibility&rdquo; is the period beginning with the first day on which he is eligible to enroll under section 1395<em>o</em> of this title and ending with his death; except that any pe<!-- PDFPage:2590 -->riod during all of which an individual satisfied paragraph (1) of section 1395<em>o</em> of this title and which terminated in or before the month preceding the month in which he attained age 65 shall be a separate &ldquo;continuous period of eligibility&rdquo; with respect to such individual (and each such period which terminates shall be deemed not to have existed for purposes of subsequently applying this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State payment of part B late enrollment premium increases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the request of a State (or any appropriate State or local governmental entity specified by the Secretary), the Secretary may enter into an agreement with the State (or such entity) under which the State (or such entity) agrees to pay on a quarterly or other periodic basis to the Secretary (to be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund) an amount equal to the amount of the part B late enrollment premium increases with respect to the premiums for eligible individuals (as defined in paragraph (3)(A)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No part B late enrollment premium increase shall apply to an eligible individual for premiums for months for which the amount of such an increase is payable under an agreement under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;eligible individual&rdquo; means an individual who is enrolled under this part B and who is within a class of individuals specified in the agreement under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;part B late enrollment premium increase&rdquo; means any increase in a premium as a result of the application of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on increase in monthly premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any calendar year after 1988, if an individual is entitled to monthly benefits under section 402 or 423 of this title or to a monthly annuity under section 3(a), 4(a), or 4(f) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231b(a), 231c(a), (f)] for November and December of the preceding year, if the monthly premium of the individual under this section for December and for January is deducted from those benefits under section 1395s(a)(1) of this title or section 1395s(b)(1) of this title, and if the amount of the individual's premium is not adjusted for such January under subsection (i) of this section, the monthly premium otherwise determined under this section for an individual for that year shall not be increased, pursuant to this subsection, to the extent that such increase would reduce the amount of benefits payable to that individual for that December below the amount of benefits payable to that individual for that November (after the deduction of the premium under this section). For purposes of this subsection, retroactive adjustments or payments and deductions on account of work shall not be taken into account in determining the monthly benefits to which an individual is entitled under section 402 or 423 of this title or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exclusions from estimate of benefits and administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In estimating the benefits and administrative costs which will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for a year for purposes of determining the monthly premium rate under subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary shall exclude an estimate of any benefits and administrative costs attributable to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an individual who is entitled to monthly benefits under section 402 or 423 of this title, his monthly premiums under this part shall (except as provided in subsections (b)(1) and (c) of this section) be collected by deducting the amount thereof from the amount of such monthly benefits. Such deduction shall be made in such manner and at such times as the Commissioner of Social Security shall by regulation prescribe. Such regulations shall be prescribed after consultation with the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, from time to time, transfer from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund the aggregate amount deducted under paragraph (1) for the period to which such transfer relates from benefits under section 402 or 423 of this title which are payable from such Trust Fund. Such transfer shall be made on the basis of a certification by the Commissioner of Social Security and shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent that prior transfers were too great or too small.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deductions from railroad retirement annuities or pensions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an individual who is entitled to receive for a month an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] (whether or not such individual is also entitled for such month to a monthly insurance benefit under section 402 of this title), his monthly premiums under this part shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this section) be collected by deducting the amount thereof from such annuity or pension. Such deduction shall be made in such manner and at such times as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe. Such regulations shall be prescribed only after consultation with the Railroad Retirement Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, from time to time, transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund the aggregate amount deducted under paragraph (1) for the period to which such transfer relates. Such transfers shall be made on the basis of a certification by the Railroad Retirement Board and shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent that prior transfers were too great or too small.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Portion of monthly premium in excess of deducted amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an individual to whom subsection (a) or (b) of this section applies estimates that the amount which will be available for deduction under such subsection for any premium payment period will be less than the amount of the monthly premiums for such period, he may (under regulations) pay to the Secretary such portion of the monthly premiums for such period as he desires.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deductions from civil service retirement annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an individual receiving an annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 or any other law administered by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management providing retirement or survivorship protection, to whom neither subsection (a) nor subsection (b) of this section applies, his monthly premiums under this part (and the monthly premiums of the spouse of such individual under this part if neither subsection (a) nor subsection (b) of this section applies to such spouse and if such individual agrees) shall, upon notice from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, be collected by deducting the amount thereof from each installment of such annuity. Such deduction shall be made in such manner and at such times as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may determine. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall furnish such information as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may reasonably request in order to carry out his functions under this part with respect to individuals to whom this subsection applies. A plan described in section 8903 or 8903a of title 5 may reimburse each annuitant enrolled in such plan an amount equal to the premiums paid by him under this part if such reimbursement is paid entirely from funds of such plan which are derived from sources other than the contributions described in section 8906 of such title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, from time to time, but not less often than quarterly, transfer from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or the account (if any) applicable in the case of such other law administered by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund the aggregate amount deducted under paragraph (1) for the period to which such transfer relates. Such transfer shall be made on the basis of a certification by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent that prior transfers were too great or too small.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Manner and time of payment prescribed by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual who participates in the insurance program established by this part but with respect to whom none of the preceding provisions of this section applies, or with respect to whom subsection (c) of this section applies, the premiums shall be paid to the Secretary at such times, and in such manner, as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2598 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Deposit of amounts in Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts paid to the Secretary under subsection (c) or (e) of this section shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Premium payability period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual who participates in the insurance program established by this part, premiums shall be payable for the period commencing with the first month of his coverage period and ending with the month in which he dies or, if earlier, in which his coverage under such program terminates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Exempted monthly benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual who is enrolled under the program established by this part as a member of a coverage group to which an agreement with a State entered into pursuant to section 1395v of this title is applicable, subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall not apply to his monthly premium for any month in his coverage period which is determined under section 1395v(d) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Adjustments for individuals enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan, the Secretary shall provide for necessary adjustments of the monthly beneficiary premium to reflect 80 percent of any reduction elected under section 1395w&ndash;24(f)(1)(E) of this title and to reflect any credit provided under section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(1)(C)(iv)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395s_1_target" name="1395s_1">1</a></sup> of this title. To the extent to which the Secretary determines that such an adjustment is appropriate, with the concurrence of any agency responsible for the administration of such benefits, such premium adjustment may be provided directly, as an adjustment to any social security, railroad retirement, or civil service retirement benefits, or, in the case of an individual who receives medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter for medicare costs described in section 1396d(p)(3)(A)(ii) of this title, as an adjustment to the amount otherwise owed by the State for such medical assistance.</p>

For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of public-debt obligations for purchase by the Trust Fund. Such obligations issued for purchase by the Trust Fund shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the Trust Fund and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield (computed by the Managing Trustee on the basis of market quotations as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue) on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of 4 years from the end of such calendar month; except that where such average market yield is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest on such obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such market yield.

<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:2604 --><p class="statutory-body-block">In determining the reasonable charge for services for purposes of this paragraph, there shall be taken into consideration the customary charges for similar services generally made by the physician or other person furnishing such services, as well as the prevailing charges in the locality for similar services. No charge may be determined to be reasonable in the case of bills submitted or requests for payment made under this part after December 31, 1970, if it exceeds the higher of (i) the prevailing charge recognized by the carrier and found acceptable by the Secretary for similar services in the same locality in administering this part on December 31, 1970, or (ii) the prevailing charge level that, on the basis of statistical data and methodology acceptable to the Secretary, would cover 75 percent of the customary charges made for similar services in the same locality during the 12-month period ending on the June 30 last preceding the start of the calendar year in which the service is rendered. In the case of physicians&rsquo; services the prevailing charge level determined for purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence for any twelve-month period (beginning after June 30, 1973) specified in clause (ii) of such sentence may not exceed (in the aggregate) the level determined under such clause for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, or (with respect to physicians&rsquo; services furnished in a year after 1987) the level determined under this sentence (or under any other provision of law affecting the prevailing charge level) for the previous year except to the extent that the Secretary finds, on the basis of appropriate economic index data, that such higher level is justified by year-to-year economic changes. With respect to power-operated wheelchairs for which payment may be made in accordance with section 1395x(s)(6) of this title, charges determined to be reasonable may not exceed the lowest charge at which power-operated wheelchairs are available in the locality. In the case of medical services, supplies, and equipment (including equipment servicing) that, in the judgment of the Secretary, do not generally vary significantly in quality from one supplier to another, the charges incurred after December 31, 1972, determined to be reasonable may not exceed the lowest charge levels at which such services, supplies, and equipment are widely and consistently available in a locality except to the extent and under the circumstances specified by the Secretary. The requirement in subparagraph (B) that a bill be submitted or request for payment be made by the close of the following calendar year shall not apply if (I) failure to submit the bill or request the payment by the close of such year is due to the error or misrepresentation of an officer, employee, fiscal intermediary, carrier, medicare administrative contractor, or agent of the Department of Health and Human Services performing functions under this subchapter and acting within the scope of his or its authority, and (II) the bill is submitted or the payment is requested promptly after such error or misrepresentation is eliminated or corrected. Notwithstanding the provisions of the third and fourth sentences preceding this sentence, the prevailing charge level in the case of a physician service in a particular locality determined pursuant to such third and fourth sentences for any calendar year after 1974 shall, if lower than the prevailing charge level for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, in the case of a similar physician service in the same locality by reason of the application of economic index data, be raised to such prevailing charge level for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and shall remain at such prevailing charge level until the prevailing charge for a year (as adjusted by economic index data) equals or exceeds such prevailing charge level. The amount of any charges for outpatient services which shall be considered reasonable shall be subject to the limitations established by regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1395x(v)(1)(K) of this title, and in determining the reasonable charge for such services, the Secretary may limit such reasonable charge to a percentage of the amount of the prevailing charge for similar services furnished in a physician's office, taking into account the extent to which overhead costs associated with such outpatient services have been included in the reasonable cost or charge of the facility. In applying subparagraph (B), the Secretary may specify exceptions to the 1 calendar year period specified in such subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A)(i) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 15-month period beginning July 1, 1984, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) at the time of furnishing the services, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) at the time of furnishing the services, the Secretary shall permit an additional one percentage point increase in the increase otherwise permitted under that sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In determining the maximum allowable prevailing charges which may be recognized consistent with the index described in the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished on or after January 1, 1987, by participating physicians, the Secretary shall treat the maximum allowable prevailing charges recognized as of December 31, 1986, under such sentence with respect to participating physicians as having been justified by economic changes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The reasonable charge for physicians&rsquo; services furnished on or after January 1, 1987, and before January 1, 1992, by a nonparticipating physician shall be no greater than the applicable percent of the prevailing charge levels established under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) (or under any other applicable pro<!-- PDFPage:2605 -->vision of law affecting the prevailing charge level). In the previous sentence, the term &ldquo;applicable percent&rdquo; means for services furnished (I) on or after January 1, 1987, and before April 1, 1988, 96 percent, (II) on or after April 1, 1988, and before January 1, 1989, 95.5 percent, and (III) on or after January 1, 1989, 95 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 3-month period beginning January 1, 1988, the Secretary shall not set any level higher than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Before each year (beginning with 1989), the Secretary shall establish a prevailing charge floor for primary care services (as defined in subsection (i)(4) of this section) equal to 60 percent of the estimated average prevailing charge levels based on the best available data (determined, under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) and under paragraph (4), without regard to this clause and without regard to physician specialty) for such service for all localities in the United States (weighted by the relative frequency of the service in each locality) for the year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) Beginning with 1987, the percentage increase in the MEI (as defined in subsection (i)(3) of this section) for each year shall be the same for nonparticipating physicians as for participating physicians.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 15-month period beginning July 1, 1984, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) at the time of furnishing the services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if the physician was not a participating physician at any time during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if the physician was a participating physician at any time during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, the physician's customary charges shall be determined based upon the physician's actual charges billed during the 12-month period ending on March 31, 1985.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 3-month period beginning January 1, 1988, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services (other than primary care services, as defined in subsection (i)(4) of this section) furnished during 1991, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 9-month period beginning April 1, 1990. In a case in which subparagraph (F) applies (relating to new physicians) so as to limit the customary charges of a physician during 1990 to a percent of prevailing charges, the previous sentence shall not prevent such limit on customary charges under such subparagraph from increasing in 1991 to a higher percent of such prevailing charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during periods beginning after September 30, 1985, the Secretary shall treat the level as set under subparagraph (A)(i) as having fully provided for the economic changes which would have been taken into account but for the limitations contained in subparagraph (A)(i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) In determining the customary charges for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 8-month period beginning May 1, 1986, or the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987, by a physician who was not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) on September 30, 1985, the Secretary shall not recognize increases in actual charges for services furnished during the 15-month period beginning on July 1, 1984, above the level of the physician's actual charges billed in the 3-month period ending on June 30, 1984.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) In determining the customary charges for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 12-month period beginning January 1, 1987, by a physician who is not a participating physician (as defined in subsection (h)(1) of this section) on April 30, 1986, the Secretary shall not recognize increases in actual charges for services furnished during the 7-month period beginning on October 1, 1985, above the level of the physician's actual charges billed during the 3-month period ending on June 30, 1984.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Quarterly report on average sales price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For requirements for reporting the manufacturer's average sales price (and, if required to make payment, the manufacturer's wholesale acquisition cost) for the drug or biological under this section, see section 1396r&ndash;8(b)(3) of this title.</p>
