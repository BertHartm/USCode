<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of subparagraph (B), items and services within a group shall not be treated as &ldquo;comparable with respect to the use of resources&rdquo; if the highest median cost (or mean cost, if elected by the Secretary under subparagraph (C)) for an item or service within the group is more than 2 times greater than the lowest median cost (or mean cost, if so elected) for an item or service within the group; except that the Secretary may make exceptions in unusual cases, such as low volume items and services, but may not make such an exception in the case of a drug or biological that has been designated as an orphan drug under section 360bb of title 21.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Calculation of base amounts</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Aggregate amounts that would be payable if deductibles were disregarded</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the total amounts that would be payable from the Trust Fund under this part for covered OPD services in 1999, determined without regard to this subsection, as though the deductible under subsection (b) of this section did not apply, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total amounts of copayments estimated to be paid under this subsection by beneficiaries to hospitals for covered OPD services in 1999, as though the deductible under subsection (b) of this section did not apply.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Unadjusted copayment amount</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subsection, subject to clause (ii), the &ldquo;unadjusted copayment amount&rdquo; applicable to a covered OPD service (or group of such services) is 20 percent of the national median of the charges for the service (or services within the group) furnished during 1996, updated to 1999 using the Secretary's estimate of charge growth during the period.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Adjusted to be 20 percent when fully phased in</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If the pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year would be equal to or exceed 80 percent, then the unadjusted copayment amount shall be 20 percent of amount determined under subparagraph (D).</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary shall establish a 1999 conversion factor for determining the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in 1999. Such conversion factor shall be established on the basis of the weights and frequencies described in paragraph (2)(C) and in such <!-- PDFPage:2031 -->a manner that the sum for all services and groups of the products (described in subclause (II) for each such service or group) equals the total projected amount described in subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Product described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The Secretary shall determine for each service or group the product of the medicare OPD fee schedule amounts (taking into account appropriate adjustments described in paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E)) and the estimated frequencies for such service or group.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Subsequent years</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to paragraph (8)(B), the Secretary shall establish a conversion factor for covered OPD services furnished in subsequent years in an amount equal to the conversion factor established under this subparagraph and applicable to such services furnished in the previous year increased by the OPD fee schedule increase factor specified under clause (iii)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395l_10_target" name="1395l_10">10</a></sup> for the year involved.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Adjustment for service mix changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Insofar as the Secretary determines that the adjustments for service mix under paragraph (2) for a previous year (or estimates that such adjustments for a future year) did (or are likely to) result in a change in aggregate payments under this subsection during the year that are a result of changes in the coding or classification of covered OPD services that do not reflect real changes in service mix, the Secretary may adjust the conversion factor computed under this subparagraph for subsequent years so as to eliminate the effect of such coding or classification changes.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) OPD fee schedule increase factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of this subparagraph, the &ldquo;OPD fee schedule increase factor&rdquo; for services furnished in a year is equal to the market basket percentage increase applicable under section 1395ww(b)(3)(B)(iii) of this title to hospital discharges occurring during the fiscal year ending in such year, reduced by 1 percentage point for such factor for services furnished in each of 2000 and 2002. In applying the previous sentence for years beginning with 2000, the Secretary may substitute for the market basket percentage increase an annual percentage increase that is computed and applied with respect to covered OPD services furnished in a year in the same manner as the market basket percentage increase is determined and applied to inpatient hospital services for discharges occurring in a fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Calculation of medicare OPD fee schedule amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall compute a medicare OPD fee schedule amount for each covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year, in an amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the conversion factor computed under subparagraph (C) for the year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the relative payment weight (determined under paragraph (2)(C)) for the service or group.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Pre-deductible payment percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The pre-deductible payment percentage for a covered OPD service (or group of such services) furnished in a year is equal to the ratio of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount established under subparagraph (D) for the year, minus the unadjusted copayment amount determined under subparagraph (B) for the service or group, to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under subparagraph (D) for the year for such service or group.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Medicare payment amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of payment made from the Trust Fund under this part for a covered OPD service (and such services classified within a group) furnished in a year is determined, subject to paragraph (7), as follows:</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Fee schedule adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The medicare OPD fee schedule amount (computed under paragraph (3)(D)) for the service or group and year is adjusted for relative differences in the cost of labor and other factors determined by the Secretary, as computed under paragraphs (2)(D) and (2)(E).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Subtract applicable deductible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Reduce the adjusted amount determined under subparagraph (A) by the amount of the deductible under subsection (b) of this section, to the extent applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Apply payment proportion to remainder</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of payment is the amount so determined under subparagraph (B) multiplied by the pre-deductible payment percentage (as determined under paragraph (3)(E)) for the service or group and year involved, plus the amount of any reduction in the copayment amount attributable to paragraph (8)(C).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Outlier adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraph (D), the Secretary shall provide for an additional payment for each covered OPD service (or group of services) for which a hospital's charges, adjusted to cost, exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) a fixed multiple of the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the applicable medicare OPD fee schedule amount determined under paragraph (3)(D), as adjusted under paragraph (4)(A) (other than for adjustments under this paragraph or paragraph (6)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) any transitional pass-through payment under paragraph (6); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) at the option of the Secretary, such fixed dollar amount as the Secretary may establish.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2032 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amount of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the additional payment under subparagraph (A) shall be determined by the Secretary and shall approximate the marginal cost of care beyond the applicable cutoff point under such subparagraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Limit on aggregate outlier adjustments</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The total of the additional payments made under this paragraph for covered OPD services furnished in a year (as estimated by the Secretary before the beginning of the year) may not exceed the applicable percentage (specified in clause (ii)) of the total program payments estimated to be made under this subsection for all covered OPD services furnished in that year. If this paragraph is first applied to less than a full year, the previous sentence shall apply only to the portion of such year.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicable percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the term &ldquo;applicable percentage&rdquo; means a percentage specified by the Secretary up to (but not to exceed)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for a year (or portion of a year) before 2004, 2.5 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for 2004 and thereafter, 3.0 percent.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Transitional authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying subparagraph (A) for covered OPD services furnished before January 1, 2002, the Secretary may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) apply such subparagraph to a bill for such services related to an outpatient encounter (rather than for a specific service or group of services) using OPD fee schedule amounts and transitional pass-through payments covered under the bill; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) use an appropriate cost-to-charge ratio for the hospital involved (as determined by the Secretary), rather than for specific departments within the hospital.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Conditions for payment for services described in section 1395k(a)(2) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (b), (c), and (e) of this section, payment for services described in section 1395k(a)(2) of this title furnished an individual may be made only to providers of services which are eligible therefor under section 1395cc(a) of this title, and only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) written request, signed by such individual, except in cases in which the Secretary finds it impracticable for the individual to do so, is filed for such payment in such form, in such manner and by such person or persons as the Secretary may by regulation prescribe, no later than the close of the period of 3 calendar years following the year in which such services are furnished (deeming any services furnished in the last 3 calendar months of any calendar year to have been furnished in the succeeding calendar year) except that, where the Secretary deems that efficient administration so requires, such period may be reduced to not less than 1 calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a physician certifies (and recertifies, where such services are furnished over a period of time, in such cases, with such frequency, and accompanied by such supporting material, appropriate to the case involved, as may be provided by regulations) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of home health services (i) such services are or were required because the individual is or was confined to his home (except when receiving items and services referred to in section 1395x(m)(7) of this title) and needs or needed skilled nursing care (other than solely venipuncture for the purpose of obtaining a blood sample) on an intermittent basis or physical or speech therapy or, in the case of an individual who has been furnished home health services based on such a need and who no longer has such a need for such care or therapy, continues or continued to need occupational therapy, (ii) a plan for furnishing such services to such individual has been established and is periodically reviewed by a physician, and (iii) such services are or were furnished while the individual is or was under the care of a physician;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in the case of outpatient speech pathology services, (i) such services are or were required because the individual needed speech pathology services, (ii) a plan for furnishing such services has been established by a physician or by the speech pathologist providing such services and is periodically reviewed by a physician, and (iii) such services are or were furnished while the individual is or was under the care of a physician;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) in the case of comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility services, (i) such services are or were required because the individual needed skilled rehabilitation services, (ii) a plan for furnishing such services has been established and is periodically reviewed by a physician, and (iii) such services are or were furnished while the individual is or was under the care of a physician; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) in the case of partial hospitalization services, (i) the individual would require inpatient psychiatric care in the absence of such services, (ii) an individualized, written plan for furnishing such services has been established by a physician and is reviewed periodically by a physician, and (iii) such services are or were furnished while the individual is or was under the care of a physician.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;provider of services&rdquo; shall include a clinic, rehabilitation agency, or public health agency if, in the case of a clinic or rehabilitation agency, such clinic or agency meets the requirements of section 1395x(p)(4)(A) of this title (or meets <!-- PDFPage:2092 -->the requirements of such section through the operation of section 1395x(g) of this title), or if, in the case of a public health agency, such agency meets the requirements of section 1395x(p)(4)(B) of this title (or meets the requirements of such section through the operation of section 1395x(g) of this title), but only with respect to the furnishing of outpatient physical therapy services (as therein defined) or (through the operation of section 1395x(g) of this title) with respect to the furnishing of outpatient occupational therapy services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">To the extent provided by regulations, the certification and recertification requirements of paragraph (2) shall be deemed satisfied where, at a later date, a physician makes a certification of the kind provided in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) (whichever would have applied), but only where such certification is accompanied by such medical and other evidence as may be required by such regulations. With respect to the physician certification required by paragraph (2) for home health services furnished to any individual by a home health agency (other than an agency which is a governmental entity) and with respect to the establishment and review of a plan for such services, the Secretary shall prescribe regulations which shall become effective no later than July 1, 1981, and which prohibit a physician who has a significant ownership interest in, or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, such home health agency from performing such certification and from establishing or reviewing such plan, except that such prohibition shall not apply with respect to a home health agency which is a sole community home health agency (as determined by the Secretary). For purposes of the preceding sentence, service by a physician as an uncompensated officer or director of a home health agency shall not constitute having a significant ownership interest in, or a significant financial or contractual relationship with, such agency. For purposes of paragraph (2)(A), an individual shall be considered to be &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo; if the individual has a condition, due to an illness or injury, that restricts the ability of the individual to leave his or her home except with the assistance of another individual or the aid of a supportive device (such as crutches, a cane, a wheelchair, or a walker), or if the individual has a condition such that leaving his or her home is medically contraindicated. While an individual does not have to be bedridden to be considered &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo;, the condition of the individual should be such that there exists a normal inability to leave home, that leaving home requires a considerable and taxing effort by the individual. Any absence of an individual from the home attributable to the need to receive health care treatment, including regular absences for the purpose of participating in therapeutic, psychosocial, or medical treatment in an adult day-care program that is licensed or certified by a State, or accredited, to furnish adult day-care services in the State shall not disqualify an individual from being considered to be &ldquo;confined to his home&rdquo;. Any other absence of an individual from the home shall not so disqualify an individual if the absence is of infrequent or of relatively short duration. For purposes of the preceding sentence, any absence for the purpose of attending a religious service shall be deemed to be an absence of infrequent or short duration.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Conditions for payment for services described in section 1395x(s) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Payment may also be made to any hospital for services described in section 1395x(s) of this title furnished as an outpatient service by a hospital or by others under arrangements made by it to an individual entitled to benefits under this part even though such hospital does not have an agreement in effect under this subchapter if (A) such services were emergency services, (B) the Secretary would be required to make such payment if the hospital had such an agreement in effect and otherwise met the conditions of payment hereunder, and (C) such hospital has made an election pursuant to section 1395f(d)(1)(C) of this title with respect to the calendar year in which such emergency services are provided. Such payments shall be made only in the amounts provided under section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(2) of this title and then only if such hospital agrees to comply, with respect to the emergency services provided, with the provisions of section 1395cc(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payment may also be made on the basis of an itemized bill to an individual for services described in paragraph (1) of this subsection if (A) payment cannot be made under such paragraph (1) solely because the hospital does not elect, in accordance with section 1395f(d)(1)(C) of this title, to claim such payments and (B) such individual files application (submitted within such time and in such form and manner, and containing and supported by such information as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe) for reimbursement. The amounts payable under this paragraph shall, subject to the provisions of section 1395<em>l</em> of this title, be equal to 80 percent of the hospital's reasonable charges for such services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Collection of charges from individuals for services specified in section 1395x(s) of this title</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding the provisions of this section and sections 1395k, 1395<em>l</em>, and 1395cc(a)(1)(A) of this title, a hospital or a critical access hospital may, subject to such limitations as may be prescribed by regulations, collect from an individual the customary charges for services specified in section 1395x(s) of this title and furnished to him by such hospital as an outpatient, but only if such charges for such services do not exceed the applicable supplementary medical insurance deductible, and such customary charges shall be regarded as expenses incurred by such individual with respect to which benefits are payable in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(1) of this title. Payments under this subchapter to hospitals which have elected to make collections from individuals in accordance with the preceding sentence shall be adjusted periodically to place the hospital in the same position it would have been had it instead been reimbursed in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(2) of this title (or, in the case of a critical access hospital, in accordance with section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(6) of this title).</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2093 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Payment to Federal provider of services or other Federal agencies prohibited</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to section 1395qq of this title, no payment may be made under this part to any Federal provider of services or other Federal agency, except a provider of services which the Secretary determines is providing services to the public generally as a community institution or agency; and no such payment may be made to any provider of services or other person for any item or service which such provider or person is obligated by a law of, or a contract with, the United States to render at public expense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Payment to fund designated by medical staff or faculty of medical school</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of services (1) which are inpatient hospital services by reason of paragraph (7) of section 1395x(b) of this title or for which entitlement exists by reason of clause (II) of section 1395k(a)(2)(B)(i) of this title, and (2) for which the reasonable cost thereof is determined under section 1395x(v)(1)(D) of this title (or would be if section 1395ww of this title did not apply), payment under this part shall be made to such fund as may be designated by the organized medical staff of the hospital in which such services were furnished or, if such services were furnished in such hospital by the faculty of a medical school, to such fund as may be designated by such faculty, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such hospital has an agreement with the Secretary under section 1395cc of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Secretary has received written assurances that (i) such payment will be used by such fund solely for the improvement of care to patients in such hospital or for educational or charitable purposes and (ii) the individuals who were furnished such services or any other persons will not be charged for such services (or if charged provision will be made for return of any moneys incorrectly collected).</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Determination of monthly actuarial rates and premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, during September of 1983 and of each year thereafter, determine the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over which shall be applicable for the succeeding calendar year. Such actuarial rate shall be the amount the Secretary estimates to be necessary so that the aggregate amount for such calendar year with respect to those enrollees age 65 and older will equal one-half of the total of the benefits and administrative costs which he estimates will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for services performed and related administrative costs incurred in such calendar year with respect to <!-- PDFPage:2103 -->such enrollees. In calculating the monthly actuarial rate, the Secretary shall include an appropriate amount for a contingency margin.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The monthly premium of each individual enrolled under this part for each month after December 1983 shall be the amount determined under paragraph (3), adjusted as required in accordance with subsections (b), (c), and (f) of this section, and to reflect 80 percent of any reduction elected under section 1395w&ndash;24(f)(1)(E) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary, during September of each year, shall determine and promulgate a monthly premium rate for the succeeding calendar year that (except as provided in subsection (g) of this section) is equal to 50 percent of the monthly actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and over, determined according to paragraph (1), for that succeeding calendar year. Whenever the Secretary promulgates the dollar amount which shall be applicable as the monthly premium rate for any period, he shall, at the time such promulgation is announced, issue a public statement setting forth the actuarial assumptions and bases employed by him in arriving at the amount of an adequate actuarial rate for enrollees age 65 and older as provided in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall also, during September of 1983 and of each year thereafter, determine the monthly actuarial rate for disabled enrollees under age 65 which shall be applicable for the succeeding calendar year. Such actuarial rate shall be the amount the Secretary estimates to be necessary so that the aggregate amount for such calendar year with respect to disabled enrollees under age 65 which will equal one-half of the total of the benefits and administrative costs which he estimates will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for services performed and related administrative costs incurred in such calendar year with respect to such enrollees. In calculating the monthly actuarial rate under this paragraph, the Secretary shall include an appropriate amount for a contingency margin.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Increase in monthly premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual whose coverage period began pursuant to an enrollment after his initial enrollment period (determined pursuant to subsection (c) or (d) of section 1395p of this title) and not pursuant to a special enrollment period under section 1395p(i)(4) of this title, the monthly premium determined under subsection (a) of this section shall be increased by 10 percent of the monthly premium so determined for each full 12 months (in the same continuous period of eligibility) in which he could have been but was not enrolled. For purposes of the preceding sentence, there shall be taken into account (1) the months which elapsed between the close of his initial enrollment period and the close of the enrollment period in which he enrolled, plus (in the case of an individual who reenrolls) (2) the months which elapsed between the date of termination of a previous coverage period and the close of the enrollment period in which he reenrolled, but there shall not be taken into account months for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was enrolled in a group health plan described in section 1395y(b)(1)(A)(v) of this title by reason of the individual's (or the individual's spouse's) current employment status or months during which the individual has not attained the age of 65 and for which the individual can demonstrate that the individual was enrolled in a large group health plan (as that term is defined in section 1395y(b)(1)(B)(iii) of this title) by reason of the individual's current employment status (or the current employment status of a family member of the individual). Any increase in an individual's monthly premium under the first sentence of this subsection with respect to a particular continuous period of eligibility shall not be applicable with respect to any other continuous period of eligibility which such individual may have.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Premiums rounded to nearest multiple of ten cents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If any monthly premium determined under the foregoing provisions of this section is not a multiple of 10 cents, such premium shall be rounded to the nearest multiple of 10 cents.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Continuous period of eligibility&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (b) of this section (and section 1395p(g)(1) of this title), an individual's &ldquo;continuous period of eligibility&rdquo; is the period beginning with the first day on which he is eligible to enroll under section 1395<em>o</em> of this title and ending with his death; except that any period during all of which an individual satisfied paragraph (1) of section 1395<em>o</em> of this title and which terminated in or before the month preceding the month in which he attained age 65 shall be a separate &ldquo;continuous period of eligibility&rdquo; with respect to such individual (and each such period which terminates shall be deemed not to have existed for purposes of subsequently applying this section).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) State payment of part B late enrollment premium increases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon the request of a State (or any appropriate State or local governmental entity specified by the Secretary), the Secretary may enter into an agreement with the State (or such entity) under which the State (or such entity) agrees to pay on a quarterly or other periodic basis to the Secretary (to be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund) an amount equal to the amount of the part B late enrollment premium increases with respect to the premiums for eligible individuals (as defined in paragraph (3)(A)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No part B late enrollment premium increase shall apply to an eligible individual for premiums for months for which the amount of such an increase is payable under an agreement under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In this subsection:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The term &ldquo;eligible individual&rdquo; means an individual who is enrolled under this part B and who is within a class of individuals specified in the agreement under paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The term &ldquo;part B late enrollment premium increase&rdquo; means any increase in a premium as a result of the application of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2104 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation on increase in monthly premium</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For any calendar year after 1988, if an individual is entitled to monthly benefits under section 402 or 423 of this title or to a monthly annuity under section 3(a), 4(a), or 4(f) of the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231b(a), 231c(a), (f)] for November and December of the preceding year, and if the monthly premium of the individual under this section for December and for January is deducted from those benefits under section 1395s(a)(1) of this title or section 1395s(b)(1) of this title, the monthly premium otherwise determined under this section for an individual for that year shall not be increased, pursuant to this subsection, to the extent that such increase would reduce the amount of benefits payable to that individual for that December below the amount of benefits payable to that individual for that November (after the deduction of the premium under this section). For purposes of this subsection, retroactive adjustments or payments and deductions on account of work shall not be taken into account in determining the monthly benefits to which an individual is entitled under section 402 or 423 of this title or under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Exclusions from estimate of benefits and administrative costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In estimating the benefits and administrative costs which will be payable from the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund for a year for purposes of determining the monthly premium rate under subsection (a)(3) of this section, the Secretary shall exclude an estimate of any benefits and administrative costs attributable to the application of section 1395x(v)(1)(L)(viii) of this title or to the establishment under section 1395x(v)(1)(L)(i)(V) of this title of a per visit limit at 106 percent of the median (instead of 105 percent of the median), but only to the extent payment for home health services under this subchapter is not being made under section 1395fff of this title (relating to prospective payment for home health services).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Deductions from section 402 or 423 monthly benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an individual who is entitled to monthly benefits under section 402 or 423 of this title, his monthly premiums under this part shall (except as provided in subsections (b)(1) and (c) of this section) be collected by deducting the amount thereof from the amount of such monthly benefits. Such deduction shall be made in such manner and at such times as the Commissioner of Social Security shall by regulation prescribe. Such regulations shall be prescribed after consultation with the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, from time to time, transfer from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund or the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund the aggregate amount deducted under paragraph (1) for the period to which such transfer relates from benefits under section 402 or 423 of this title which are payable from such Trust Fund. Such transfer shall be made on the basis of a certification by the Commissioner of Social Security and shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent that prior transfers were too great or too small.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Deductions from railroad retirement annuities or pensions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an individual who is entitled to receive for a month an annuity under the Railroad Retirement Act of 1974 [45 U.S.C. 231 et seq.] (whether or not such individual is also entitled for such month to a monthly insurance benefit under section 402 of this title), his monthly premiums under this part shall (except as provided in subsection (c) of this section) be collected by deducting the amount thereof from such annuity or pension. Such deduction shall be made in such manner and at such times as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe. Such regulations shall be prescribed only after consultation with the Railroad Retirement Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, from time to time, transfer from the Railroad Retirement Account to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund the aggregate amount deducted under paragraph (1) for the period to which such transfer relates. Such transfers shall be made on the basis of a certification by the Railroad Retirement Board and shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent that prior transfers were too great or too small.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Portion of monthly premium in excess of deducted amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If an individual to whom subsection (a) or (b) of this section applies estimates that the amount which will be available for deduction under such subsection for any premium payment period will be less than the amount of the monthly premiums for such period, he may (under regulations) pay to the Secretary such portion of the monthly premiums for such period as he desires.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Deductions from civil service retirement annuities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In the case of an individual receiving an annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of title 5 or any other law administered by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management providing retirement or survivorship protection, to whom neither subsection (a) nor subsection (b) of this section applies, his monthly premiums under this part (and the monthly premiums of the spouse of such individual under this part if neither subsection (a) nor subsection (b) of this section applies to such spouse and if such individual agrees) shall, upon notice from the Secretary of Health and Human Services to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, be collected by deducting the amount thereof from each installment of such annuity. Such deduction shall be made in such manner and at such times as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may determine. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall furnish such information as the Secretary of Health and Human Services may reasonably request in order to carry out his functions under this part with respect to individuals to whom this subsection applies. A plan described in section 8903 or 8903a of title 5 may reimburse each annuitant enrolled in such plan an amount equal to the premiums paid by him under this part if such reimbursement is paid entirely from funds of such plan which are derived from sources other than the contributions described in section 8906 of such title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary of the Treasury shall, from time to time, but not less often than quarterly, transfer from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund, or the account (if any) applicable in the case of such other law administered by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, to the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund the aggregate amount deducted under paragraph (1) for the period to which such transfer relates. Such transfer shall be made on the basis of a certification by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management and shall be appropriately adjusted to the extent that prior transfers were too great or too small.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Manner and time of payment prescribed by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual who participates in the insurance program established by this part but with respect to whom none of the preceding provisions of this section applies, or with respect to whom subsection (c) of this section applies, the premiums shall be paid to the Secretary at such times, and in such manner, as the Secretary shall by regulations prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Deposit of amounts in Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Amounts paid to the Secretary under subsection (c) or (e) of this section shall be depos<!-- PDFPage:2109 -->ited in the Treasury to the credit of the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Premium payability period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual who participates in the insurance program established by this part, premiums shall be payable for the period commencing with the first month of his coverage period and ending with the month in which he dies or, if earlier, in which his coverage under such program terminates.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Exempted monthly benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual who is enrolled under the program established by this part as a member of a coverage group to which an agreement with a State entered into pursuant to section 1395v of this title is applicable, subsections (a), (b), (c), and (d) of this section shall not apply to his monthly premium for any month in his coverage period which is determined under section 1395v(d) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Adjustments for individuals enrolled in Medicare+Choice plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of an individual enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan, the Secretary shall provide for necessary adjustments of the monthly beneficiary premium to reflect 80 percent of any reduction elected under section 1395w&ndash;24(f)(1)(E) of this title. To the extent to which the Secretary determines that such an adjustment is appropriate, with the concurrence of any agency responsible for the administration of such benefits, such premium adjustment may be provided directly, as an adjustment to any social security, railroad retirement, or civil service retirement benefits, or, in the case of an individual who receives medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter for medicare costs described in section 1396d(p)(3)(A)(ii) of this title, as an adjustment to the amount otherwise owed by the State for such medical assistance.</p>

The Trust Fund shall consist of such gifts and bequests as may be made as provided in section 401(i)(1) of this title, and such amounts as may be deposited in, or appropriated to, such fund as provided in this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Board of Trustees; composition; meetings; duties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to the Trust Fund, there is hereby created a body to be known as the Board of Trustees of the Trust Fund (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Board of Trustees&rdquo;) composed of the Commissioner of Social Security, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Labor, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, all ex officio, and of two members of the public (both of whom may not be from the same political party), who shall be nominated by the President for a term of four years and subject to confirmation by the Senate. A member of the Board of Trustees serving as a member of the public and nominated and confirmed to fill a vacancy occurring during a term shall be nominated and confirmed only for the remainder of such term. An individual nominated and confirmed as a member of the public may serve in such position after the expiration of such member's term until the earlier of the time at which the member's successor takes office or the time at which a report of the Board is first issued under paragraph (2) after the expiration of the member's term.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Investment of Trust Fund by Managing Trustee</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of the Managing Trustee to invest such portion of the Trust Fund as is not, in his judgment, required to meet current withdrawals. Such investments may be made <!-- PDFPage:2111 -->only in interest-bearing obligations of the United States or in obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States. For such purpose such obligations may be acquired (1) on original issue at the issue price, or (2) by purchase of outstanding obligations at the market price. The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are hereby extended to authorize the issuance at par of public-debt obligations for purchase by the Trust Fund. Such obligations issued for purchase by the Trust Fund shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the Trust Fund and shall bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield (computed by the Managing Trustee on the basis of market quotations as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of such issue) on all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of 4 years from the end of such calendar month; except that where such average market yield is not a multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum, the rate of interest on such obligations shall be the multiple of one-eighth of 1 per centum nearest such market yield. The Managing Trustee may purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United States or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, on original issue or at the market price, only where he determines that the purchase of such other obligations is in the public interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authority of Managing Trustee to sell obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any obligations acquired by the Trust Fund (except public-debt obligations issued exclusively to the Trust Fund) may be sold by the Managing Trustee at the market price, and such public-debt obligations may be redeemed at par plus accrued interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Interest on or proceeds from sale or redemption of obligations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The interest on, and the proceeds from the sale or redemption of, any obligations held in the Trust Fund shall be credited to and form a part of the Trust Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfers to other Funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be transferred periodically (but not less often than once each fiscal year) to the Trust Fund from the Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and from the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund amounts equivalent to the amounts not previously so transferred which the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall have certified as overpayments (other than amounts so certified to the Railroad Retirement Board) pursuant to section 1395gg(b) of this title. There shall be transferred periodically (but not less often than once each fiscal year) to the Trust Fund from the Railroad Retirement Account amounts equivalent to the amounts not previously so transferred which the Secretary of Health and Human Services shall have certified as overpayments to the Railroad Retirement Board pursuant to section 1395gg(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Payments from Trust Fund of amounts provided for by this part or with respect to administrative expenses</h4>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authority of Secretary to enter into contracts with carriers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to provide for the administration of the benefits under this part with maximum efficiency and convenience for individuals entitled to benefits under this part and for providers of services and other persons furnishing services to such individuals, and with a view to furthering coordination of the administration of the benefits under part A of this subchapter and under this part, the Secretary is authorized to enter into contracts with carriers, including carriers with which agreements under section 1395h of this title are in effect, which will perform some or all of the following functions (or, to the extent provided in such contracts, will secure performance thereof by other organizations); and, with respect to any of the following functions which involve payments for physicians&rsquo; services on a reasonable charge basis, the Secretary shall to the extent possible enter into such contracts:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) make determinations of the rates and amounts of payments required pursuant to this part to be made to providers of services and other persons on a reasonable cost or reasonable charge basis (as may be applicable);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) receive, disburse, and account for funds in making such payments; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make such audits of the records of providers of services as may be necessary to assure that proper payments are made under this part;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) determine compliance with the requirements of section 1395x(k) of this title as to utilization review; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) assist providers of services and other persons who furnish services for which payment may be made under this part in the development of procedures relating to utilization practices, make studies of the effectiveness of such procedures and methods for their improvement, assist in the application of safeguards against unnecessary utilization of services furnished by providers of services and other persons to individuals entitled to benefits under this part, and provide procedures for and assist in arranging, where necessary, the establishment of groups outside hospitals (meeting the requirements of section 1395x(k)(2) of this title) to make reviews of utilization;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) serve as a channel of communication of information relating to the administration of this part; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) otherwise assist, in such manner as the contract may provide, in discharging administrative duties necessary to carry out the purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applicability of competitive bidding provisions; findings as to financial responsibility, etc., of carrier; contractual duties imposed by contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Contracts with carriers under subsection (a) of this section may be entered into without regard to section 5 of title 41 or any other provision of law requiring competitive bidding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) No such contract shall be entered into with any carrier unless the Secretary finds that such carrier will perform its obligations under the contract efficiently and effectively and will meet such requirements as to financial responsibility, legal authority, and other matters as he finds pertinent. The Secretary shall publish in the Federal Register standards and criteria for the efficient and effective performance of contract obligations under this section, and opportunity shall be provided for public comment prior to implementation. In establishing such standards and criteria, the Secretary shall provide a system to measure a carrier's performance of responsibilities described in paragraph (3)(H), subsection (h) of this section, and section 1395w&ndash;1(e)(2)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395u_1_target" name="1395u_1">1</a></sup> of this title. The Secretary may not require, as a condition of entering into or renewing a contract under this section or under section 1395hh of this title, that a carrier match data obtained other than in its activities under this part with data used in the administration of this part for purposes of identifying situations in which section 1395y(b) of this title may apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall establish standards for evaluating carriers&rsquo; performance of reviews of <!-- PDFPage:2114 -->initial carrier determinations and of fair hearings under paragraph (3)(C), under which a carrier is expected&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) to complete such reviews, within 45 days after the date of a request by an individual enrolled under this part for such a review, in 95 percent of such requests, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) to make a final determination, within 120 days after the date of receipt of a request by an individual enrolled under this part for a fair hearing under paragraph (3)(C), in 90 percent of such cases.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In the case of residents of nursing facilities who receive services described in clause (i) or (ii) of section 1395x(s)(2)(K) of this title performed by a member of a team, the Secretary shall instruct carriers to develop mechanisms which permit routine payment under this part for up to 1.5 visits per month per resident. In the previous sentence, the term &ldquo;team&rdquo; refers to a physician and includes a physician assistant acting under the supervision of the physician or a nurse practitioner working in collaboration with that physician, or both.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In addition to any other standards and criteria established by the Secretary for evaluating carrier performance under this paragraph relating to avoiding erroneous payments, the carrier shall be subject to standards and criteria relating to the carrier's success in recovering payments made under this part for items or services for which payment has been or could be made under a primary plan (as defined in section 1395y(b)(2)(A) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) With respect to the payment of claims for home health services under this part that, but for the amendments made by section 4611 of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, would be payable under part A of this subchapter instead of under this part, the Secretary shall continue administration of such claims through fiscal intermediaries under section 1395h of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each such contract shall provide that the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) will take such action as may be necessary to assure that, where payment under this part for a service is on a cost basis, the cost is reasonable cost (as determined under section 1395x(v) of this title);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) will take such action as may be necessary to assure that, where payment under this part for a service is on a charge basis, such charge will be reasonable and not higher than the charge applicable, for a comparable service and under comparable circumstances, to the policyholders and subscribers of the carrier, and such payment will (except as otherwise provided in section 1395gg(f) of this title) be made&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) on the basis of an itemized bill; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) on the basis of an assignment under the terms of which (I) the reasonable charge is the full charge for the service, (II) the physician or other person furnishing such service agrees not to charge (and to refund amounts already collected) for services for which payment under this subchapter is denied under section 1320c&ndash;3(a)(2) of this title by reason of a determination under section 1320c&ndash;3(a)(1)(B) of this title, and (III) the physician or other person furnishing such service agrees not to charge (and to refund amounts already collected) for such service if payment may not be made therefor by reason of the provisions of paragraph (1) of section 1395y(a) of this title, and if the individual to whom such service was furnished was without fault in incurring the expenses of such service, and if the Secretary's determination that payment (pursuant to such assignment) was incorrect and was made subsequent to the third year following the year in which notice of such payment was sent to such individual; except that the Secretary may reduce such three-year period to not less than one year if he finds such reduction is consistent with the objectives of this subchapter (except in the case of physicians&rsquo; services and ambulance service furnished as described in section 1395y(a)(4) of this title, other than for purposes of section 1395gg(f) of this title);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but (in the case of bills submitted, or requests for payment made, after March 1968) only if the bill is submitted, or a written request for payment is made in such other form as may be permitted under regulations, no later than the close of the calendar year following the year in which such service is furnished (deeming any service furnished in the last 3 months of any calendar year to have been furnished in the succeeding calendar year);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) will establish and maintain procedures pursuant to which an individual enrolled under this part will be granted an opportunity for a fair hearing by the carrier, in any case where the amount in controversy is at least $100, but less than $500, when requests for payment under this part with respect to services furnished him are denied or are not acted upon with reasonable promptness or when the amount of such payment is in controversy;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">and shall contain such other terms and conditions not inconsistent with this section as the Secretary may find necessary or appropriate. In determining the reasonable charge for services for purposes of this paragraph, there shall be taken into consideration the customary charges for similar services generally made by the physician or other person furnishing such services, as well as the prevailing charges in the locality for similar services. No charge may be determined to be reasonable in the case of bills submitted or requests for payment made under this part after December 31, 1970, if it exceeds the higher of (i) the prevailing charge recognized by the carrier and found acceptable by the Secretary for similar services in the same locality in administering this part on December 31, 1970, or (ii) the prevailing charge level that, on the basis of statistical data and methodology acceptable to the Secretary, would cover 75 percent of the customary charges made for similar services in the same locality during the 12-month period ending on the June 30 last preceding the start of the calendar year in which the service is rendered. In the case of physicians&rsquo; services the prevailing charge level determined for purposes of clause (ii) of the preceding sentence for any twelve-month period (beginning after June 30, 1973) specified in clause (ii) of such sentence may not exceed (in the aggregate) the level determined under such clause for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1973, or (with respect to physicians&rsquo; services furnished in a year after 1987) the level determined under this sentence (or under any other provision of law affecting the prevailing charge level) for the previous year except to the extent that the Secretary finds, on the basis of appropriate economic index data, that such higher level is justified by year-to-year economic changes. With respect to power-operated wheelchairs for which payment may be made in accordance with section 1395x(s)(6) of this title, charges determined to be reasonable may not exceed the lowest charge at which power-operated wheelchairs are available in the locality. In the case of medical services, supplies, and equipment (including equipment servicing) that, in the judgment of the Secretary, do not generally vary significantly in quality from one supplier to another, the charges incurred after December 31, 1972, determined to be reasonable may not exceed the lowest charge levels at which such services, supplies, and equipment are widely and consistently available in a locality except to the extent and under the circumstances specified by the Secretary. The requirement in subparagraph (B) that a bill be submitted or request for payment be made by the close of the following calendar year shall not apply if (I) failure to submit the bill or request the payment by the close of such year is due to the error or misrepresentation of an officer, employee, fiscal intermediary, carrier, or agent of the Department of Health and Human Services performing functions under this subchapter and acting within the scope of his or its authority, and (II) the bill is submitted or the payment is requested promptly after such error or misrepresentation is eliminated or corrected. Notwithstanding the provisions of the third and fourth sentences preceding this sentence, the prevailing charge level in the case of a physician service in a particular locality determined pursuant to such third and fourth sentences for any calendar year after 1974 shall, if lower than the prevailing charge level for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, in the case of a similar physician service in the same locality by reason of the application of economic index data, be raised to such prevailing charge level for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, and shall remain at such prevailing charge level until the prevailing charge for a year (as adjusted by economic index data) equals or exceeds such prevailing charge level. The amount of any charges for outpatient services which shall be considered reasonable shall be subject to the limitations established by regulations issued by the Secretary pursuant to section 1395x(v)(1)(K) of this title, and in determining the reasonable charge for such services, the Secretary may limit such reasonable charge to a percentage of the amount of the prevailing charge for similar services furnished in a physician's office, taking into account the extent to which overhead costs associated with such outpatient services have been included in the reasonable cost or charge of the facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A)(i) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during the 15-month period beginning July 1, 1984, the Secretary shall not set any level higher <!-- PDFPage:2116 -->than the same level as was set for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iii) In determining the maximum allowable prevailing charges which may be recognized consistent with the index described in the fourth sentence of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished on or after January 1, 1987, by participating physicians, the Secretary shall treat the maximum allowable prevailing charges recognized as of December 31, 1986, under such sentence with respect to participating physicians as having been justified by economic changes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) The reasonable charge for physicians&rsquo; services furnished on or after January 1, 1987, and before January 1, 1992, by a nonparticipating physician shall be no greater than the applicable percent of the prevailing charge levels established under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) (or under any other applicable provision of law affecting the prevailing charge level). In the previous sentence, the term &ldquo;applicable percent&rdquo; means for services furnished (I) on or after January 1, 1987, and before April 1, 1988, 96 percent, (II) on or after April 1, 1988, and before January 1, 1989, 95.5 percent, and (III) on or after January 1, 1989, 95 percent.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Before each year (beginning with 1989), the Secretary shall establish a prevailing charge floor for primary care services (as defined in subsection (i)(4) of this section) equal to 60 percent of the estimated average prevailing charge levels based on the best available data (determined, under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) and under paragraph (4), without regard to this clause and without regard to physician specialty) for such service for all localities in the United States (weighted by the relative frequency of the service in each locality) for the year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if the physician was not a participating physician at any time during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1983, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if the physician was a participating physician at any time during the 12-month period beginning on October 1, 1984, the physician's customary charges shall be determined based upon the physician's actual charges billed during the 12-month period ending on March 31, 1985.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(iv) In determining the reasonable charge under paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services (other than primary care services, as defined in subsection (i)(4) of this section) furnished during 1991, the customary charges shall be the same customary charges as were recognized under this section for the 9-month period beginning April 1, 1990. In a case in which subparagraph (F) applies (relating to new physicians) so as to limit the customary charges of a physician during 1990 to a percent of prevailing charges, the previous sentence shall not prevent such limit on customary charges under such subparagraph from increasing in 1991 to a higher percent of such prevailing charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In determining the prevailing charge levels under the third and fourth sentences of paragraph (3) for physicians&rsquo; services furnished during periods beginning after September 30, 1985, the Secretary shall treat the level as set under subparagraph (A)(i) as having fully provided for the economic changes which would have been taken into account but for the limitations contained in subparagraph (A)(i).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payment based on fee schedule</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Effective for all physicians&rsquo; services (as defined in subsection (j)(3) of this section) furnished under this part during a year (beginning with 1992) for which payment is otherwise made on the basis of a reasonable charge or on the basis of a fee schedule under section 1395m(b) of this title, payment under this part shall instead be based on the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the actual charge for the service, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) subject to the succeeding provisions of this subsection, the amount determined under the fee schedule established under subsection (b) of this section for services furnished during that year (in this subsection referred to as the &ldquo;fee schedule amount&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Transition to full fee schedule</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Limiting reductions and increases to 15 percent in 1992</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Limit on increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a service in a fee schedule area (as defined in subsection (j)(2) of this section) for which the adjusted historical payment basis (as defined in subparagraph (D)) is less than 85 percent of the fee schedule amount for services furnished in 1992, there shall be substituted for the fee schedule amount an amount equal to the adjusted historical payment basis plus 15 percent of the fee schedule amount otherwise established (without regard to this paragraph).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limit in reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a service in a fee schedule area for which the adjusted historical payment basis exceeds 115 percent of the fee schedule amount for services furnished in 1992, there shall be substituted for the fee schedule amount an amount equal to the adjusted historical payment basis minus 15 percent of the fee schedule amount otherwise established (without regard to this paragraph).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for 1993, 1994, and 1995</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If a physicians&rsquo; service in a fee schedule area is subject to the provisions of subparagraph (A) in 1992, for physicians&rsquo; services furnished in the area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) during 1993, there shall be substituted for the fee schedule amount an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 75 percent of the fee schedule amount determined under subparagraph (A), adjusted by the update established under subsection (d)(3) of this section for 1993, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 25 percent of the fee schedule amount determined under paragraph (1) for 1993 without regard to this paragraph;</p>

<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In this paragraph, the term &ldquo;adjusted historical payment basis&rdquo; means, with respect to a physicians&rsquo; service furnished in a fee schedule area, the weighted average prevailing charge applied in the area for the service in 1991 (as determined by the Secretary without regard to physician specialty and as adjusted to reflect payments for services with customary charges below the prevailing charge or other payment limitations imposed by law or regulation) adjusted by the update established under subsection (d)(3) of this section for 1992.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Application to radiology services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In applying clause (i) in the case of physicians&rsquo; services which are radiology services (including radiologist services, as defined in section 1395m(b)(6) of this title), but excluding nuclear medicine services that are subject to section 6105(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, there shall be substituted for the weighted average prevailing charge the amount provided under the fee schedule established for the service for the fee schedule area under section 1395m(b) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">In applying paragraph (1)(B) in the case of a nonparticipating physician or a nonparticipating supplier or other person, the fee schedule amount shall be 95 percent of such amount otherwise applied under this subsection (without regard to this paragraph). In the case of physicians&rsquo; services (including services which the Secretary excludes pursuant to subsection (j)(3) of this section) of a nonparticipating physician, supplier, or other person for which payment is made under this part on a basis other than the fee schedule amount, the payment shall be based on 95 percent of the payment basis for such services furnished by a participating physician, supplier, or other person.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Special rule for medical direction</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to physicians&rsquo; services furnished on or after January 1, 1994, and consisting of medical direction of two, three, or four concurrent anesthesia cases, the fee schedule amount to be applied shall be equal to one-half of the amount described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount described in this subparagraph, for a physician's medical direction of the performance of anesthesia services, is the following percentage of the fee schedule amount otherwise applicable under this section if the anesthesia services were personally performed by the physician alone:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) For services furnished during 1994, 120 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) For services furnished during 1995, 115 percent.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Before November 1 of the preceding year, for each year beginning with 1998, the Secretary shall establish, by regulation, fee schedules that establish payment amounts for all physicians&rsquo; services furnished in all fee schedule areas (as defined in subsection (j)(2) of this section) for the year. Except as provided in paragraph (2), each such payment amount for a service shall be equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the relative value for the service (as determined in subsection (c)(2) of this section),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the conversion factor (established under subsection (d) of this section) for the year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the geographic adjustment factor (established under subsection (e)(2) of this section) for the service for the fee schedule area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of radiology services and anesthesia services</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to radiology services (including radiologist services, as defined in section 1395m(b)(6) of this title), the Secretary shall base the relative values on the relative value scale developed under section 1395m(b)(1)(A) of this title, with appropriate modifications of the relative values to assure that the rel<!-- PDFPage:2159 -->ative values established for radiology services which are similar or related to other physicians&rsquo; services are consistent with the relative values established for those similar or related services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Anesthesia services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing the fee schedule for anesthesia services for which a relative value guide has been established under section 4048(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987, the Secretary shall use, to the extent practicable, such relative value guide, with appropriate adjustment of the conversion factor, in a manner to assure that the fee schedule amounts for anesthesia services are consistent with the fee schedule amounts for other services determined by the Secretary to be of comparable value. In applying the previous sentence, the Secretary shall adjust the conversion factor by geographic adjustment factors in the same manner as such adjustment is made under paragraph (1)(C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall consult with the Physician Payment Review Commission and organizations representing physicians or suppliers who furnish radiology services and anesthesia services in applying subparagraphs (A) and (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;practice expense component&rdquo; means the portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects the general categories of expenses (such as office rent and wages of personnel, but excluding malpractice expenses) comprising practice expenses.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) &ldquo;Malpractice component&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The term &ldquo;malpractice component&rdquo; means the portion of the resources used in furnishing the service that reflects malpractice expenses in furnishing the service.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Determination of relative values</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Combination of units for components</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall develop a methodology for combining the work, practice expense, and malpractice relative value units, determined under subparagraph (C), for each service in a manner to produce a single relative value for that service. Such relative values are subject to adjustment under subparagraph (F)(i) and section 13515(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Extrapolation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary may use extrapolation and other techniques to determine the number of relative value units for physicians&rsquo; services for which specific data are not available and shall take into account recommendations of the Physician Payment Review Commission and the results of consultations with organizations representing physicians who provide such services.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Periodic review and adjustments in relative values</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Periodic review</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary, not less often than every 5 years, shall review the relative values established under this paragraph for all physicians&rsquo; services.</p>

<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Limitation on annual adjustments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">The adjustments under subclause (I) for a year may not cause the amount of expenditures under this part for the year to differ by more than $20,000,000 from the amount of expenditures under this part that would have been made if such adjustments had not been made.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary, in making adjustments under clause (ii), shall consult with the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission and organizations representing physicians.</p>

For 1999, such number of units shall be determined based 75 percent on such product and based 25 percent on the relative practice expense resources involved in furnishing the service. For 2000, such number of units shall be determined based 50 percent on such product and based 50 percent on such relative practice expense resources. For 2001, such number of units shall be determined based 25 percent on such product and based 75 percent on such relative practice expense resources. For a subsequent year, such number of units shall be determined based entirely on such relative practice expense resources.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Malpractice relative value units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall determine a number of malpractice relative value units for the service for years before 2000 equal to the product of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall reduce the relative values for all services (other than anesthesia services) established under this paragraph (and, in the case of anesthesia services, the conversion factor established by the Secretary for such services) by such percentage as the Secretary determines to be necessary so that, beginning in 1996, the amendment made by section 13514(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 would not result in expenditures under this section that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made if such amendment had not been made, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall reduce the amounts determined under subsection (a)(2)(B)(ii)(I) of this section by such percentage as the Secretary determines to be required to assure that, taking into account the reductions made under clause (i), the amendment made by section 13514(a) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 would not result in expenditures under this section in 1994 that exceed the amount of such expenditures that would have been made if such amendment had not been made.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Adjustments in relative value units for 1998</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Division of services by specialty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each physician's service or class of physicians&rsquo; services, the Secretary shall determine the average percentage of each such service or class of services that is performed, nationwide, under this part by physicians in each of the different physician specialties (as identified by the Secretary).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Division of specialty by component</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall determine the average percentage division of resources, among the work component, the practice expense component, and the malpractice component, used by physicians in each of such specialties in furnishing physicians&rsquo; services.
