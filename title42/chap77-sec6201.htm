<p class="note-body">(b) Agencies are encouraged to franchise the services of their Project Teams. The ability to access the services of other agencies&rsquo; teams will foster excellence in project implementation through competition among service providers, while providing an alternative method to meet or exceed the requirements of the Act and this order for agencies that are unable to devote sufficient personnel to implement projects.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 506. <em>FEMP Account Managers</em>. FEMP shall develop a customer service program and assign account managers to agencies or regions so that each project may have a designated account manager. When requested by an agency, the account manager shall start at the audit phase and follow a project through commissioning, evaluation, and reporting. The account manager shall provide technical assistance and shall have responsibility to see that all actions possible are taken to ensure success of the project.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 507. <em>Procurement of Energy Efficient Products by Federal Agencies</em>. (a) <em>&ldquo;Best Practice&rdquo; Technologies</em>. Agencies shall purchase energy-efficient products in accordance with the guidelines issued by OMB, in consultation with the Defense Logistics Agency (&ldquo;DLA&rdquo;), DOE, and GSA, under section 161 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 8262g]. The guidelines shall include listings of energy-efficient products and practices used in the Federal Government. At a minimum, OMB shall update the listings annually. DLA, DOE, and GSA shall update the portions of the listings for which they have responsibility as new products become available and conditions change.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) Each agency shall purchase products listed as energy-efficient in the guidelines whenever practicable, and whenever they meet the agency's specific performance requirements and are cost-effective. Each agency shall institute mechanisms to set targets and measure progress.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) To further encourage a market for highly-energy-efficient products, each agency shall increase, to the extent practicable and cost-effective, purchases of products that are in the upper 25 percent of energy efficiency for all similar products, or products that are at least 10 percent more efficient than the minimum level that meets Federal standards. This requirement shall apply wherever such information is <!-- PDFPage:4264 -->available, either through Federal or industry-approved testing and rating procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) GSA and DLA, in consultation with DOE, other agencies, States, and industry and other nongovernment organizations, shall provide all agencies with information on specific products that meet the energy-efficiency criteria of this section. Product information should be made available in both printed and electronic formats.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Federal Market Opportunities</em>. DOE, after consultation with industry, utilities, and other interested parties, shall identify advanced energy-efficient and water-conserving technologies that are technically and commercially feasible but not yet available on the open market. These technologies may include, but are not limited to, the advanced appliance technologies referenced in section 127 of the Energy Policy Act of 1992 [42 U.S.C. 6292 note]. DOE, in cooperation with OMB, GSA, DOD, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (&ldquo;NIST&rdquo;), and EPA, shall issue a &ldquo;Federal Procurement Challenge&rdquo; inviting each Federal agency to commit a specified fraction of their purchases within a given time period to advanced, high-efficiency models of products, provided that these anticipated future products can meet the agency's energy performance, functionality, and cost requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Accelerated Retirement of Inefficient Equipment</em>. DOE, in consultation with GSA and other agencies, shall establish guidelines for the cost-effective early retirement of older, inefficient appliances and other energy and water-using equipment in Federal facilities. Such guidelines may take into account significant improvements in energy efficiency and water conservation, opportunities to down-size or otherwise optimize the replacement equipment as a result of associated improvements in building envelope, system, or industrial process efficiency and reductions in pollutant emissions, use of chlorofluorocarbons, and other environmental improvements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) <em>Review of Barriers</em>. Each agency shall review and revise Federal or military specifications, product descriptions, and standards to eliminate barriers to, and encourage Federal procurement of, products that are energy-efficient or water conserving.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 6&mdash;WAIVERS</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 601. <em>Waivers</em>. Each agency may determine whether certain requirements in this order are inconsistent with the mission of the agency and seek a waiver of the provision from the Secretary of Energy. Any waivers authorized by the Secretary of Energy shall be included in the annual report on Federal energy management required under the Act.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">PART 7&mdash;REVOCATION, LIMITATION, AND IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 701. Executive Order No. 12759 [set out above], of April 17, 1991, is hereby revoked, except that sections 3, 9, and 10 of that order shall remain effective and shall not be revoked.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 702. This order is intended only to improve the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not create, any right to administrative or judicial review, or any other right or benefit or trust responsibility, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 703. This order shall be effective immediately.</p>
