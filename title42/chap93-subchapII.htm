<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any penalty under paragraph (1) may be assessed by the court in any action under this section brought in any appropriate United States district court or any other court of competent jurisdiction. Except to the extent provided in paragraph (3), any such penalty collected shall be deposited into the general fund of the United States Treasury as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may enter into an agreement with the Governor of any State under which amounts collected pursuant to this subsection may be collected and retained by the State to the extent necessary to cover costs incurred by that State in connection with the administration and enforcement of the requirements of subsection (a) of this section the authority for which is delegated under subsection (g) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Administration and enforcement delegated to States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is hereby delegated to the Governor of any State, and other State and local officers and employees designated by the Governor, the authority to administer and enforce, within that State, any provision of this subchapter which is to be administered and enforced in accordance with this section.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) If at any time the conditions of subsection (c)(1)(B) of this section are no longer satisfied in any State to which a delegation has been made under paragraph (1), the attorney general of that State shall transmit a written statement to that effect to the Governor of that State and to the President. Such delegation shall be considered revoked effective upon receipt by the President of such written statement and a determination by the President that such conditions are no longer satisfied, but only to the extent of that determination and consistent with such attorney general's statement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Any revocation under subparagraph (A) or (B) shall not affect any action or pending proceedings, administrative or civil, not finally determined on the date of such revocation, nor any administrative or civil action or proceeding, whether or not pending, based on any act committed or liability incurred prior to such revocation.</p>
