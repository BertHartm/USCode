<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary may not approve a loan guarantee for a project under this part unless he determines that (A) the terms, conditions, security (if any), and schedule and amount of repayments with respect to the loan are sufficient to protect the financial interests of the United States and are otherwise reasonable, including a determination that the rate of interest does not exceed such per centum per annum on the principal obligation outstanding as the Secretary determines to be reasonable, taking into account the range of interest rates prevailing in the private market for similar loans and the risks assumed by the United States, and (B) the loan would not be available on reasonable terms and conditions without the guarantee under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The United States shall be entitled to recover from the applicant for a loan guarantee under this part the amount of any payment made pursuant to such guarantee, unless the Secretary for good cause waives such right of recovery; and, upon making any such payment, the United States shall be subrogated to all of the rights of the recipient of the payments with respect to which the guarantee was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) To the extent permitted by subparagraph (C), any terms and conditions applicable to a loan guarantee under this part (including terms and conditions imposed under subparagraph (D)) may be modified by the Secretary to the extent he determines it to be consistent with the financial interest of the United States.</p>
