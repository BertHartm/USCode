<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Applications</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Submission to the Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To be eligible to receive a grant under subsection (a), a project sponsor or unified funding agency in a geographic area shall submit an application to the Secretary at such time and in such manner as the Secretary may require, and containing such information as the Secretary determines necessary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to determine compliance with the program requirements and selection criteria under this part; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Obligation, distribution, and utilization of funds</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirements for obligation</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">At the discretion of the Secretary, and in compelling circumstances, the Secretary may extend the date by which a recipient or project sponsor shall meet the requirements described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) if the Secretary determines that compliance with the requirements was delayed due to factors beyond the reasonable control of the recipient or project sponsor. Such factors may include difficulties in obtaining site control for a proposed project, completing the process of obtaining secure financing for the project, obtaining approvals from State or local governments, or completing the technical submission requirements for the project.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Obligation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 45 days after a recipient or project sponsor meets the requirements described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall obligate the funds for the grant involved.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Expenditure of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may establish a date by which funds made available through a grant announced under subsection (c)(2) for a homeless assistance project shall be entirely expended by the recipient or project sponsors involved. The date established under this paragraph shall not occur before the expiration of the 24-month period beginning on the date that funds are obligated for activities described under paragraphs&nbsp;<sup><a href="#11382_1_target" name="11382_1">1</a></sup> (1) or (2) of section 11383(a) of this title.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Renewal funding for unsuccessful applicants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may renew funding for a specific project previously funded under this part that the Secretary determines meets the purposes of this part, and was included as part of a total application that met the criteria of subsection (c), even if the application was not selected to receive grant assistance. The Secretary may renew the funding for a period of not more than 1 year, and under such conditions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Considerations in determining renewal funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">When providing renewal funding for leasing, operating costs, or rental assistance for permanent housing, the Secretary shall make adjustments proportional to increases in the fair market rents in the geographic area.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Solo applicants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A solo applicant may submit an application to the Secretary for a grant under subsection (a) and be awarded such grant on the same basis as such grants are awarded to other applicants based on the criteria described in section 11386a of this title, but only if the Secretary determines that the solo applicant has attempted to participate in the continuum of care process but was not permitted to participate in a reasonable manner. The Secretary may award such grants directly to such applicants in a manner determined to be appropriate by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Flexibility to serve persons defined as homeless under other Federal laws</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The 10 percent limitation under paragraph (1) shall not apply to collaborative applicants <!-- PDFPage:7153 -->in which the rate of homelessness, as calculated in the most recent point in time count, is less than one-tenth of 1 percent of total population.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Treatment of certain populations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Notwithstanding section 11302(a) of this title and subject to subparagraph (B), funds awarded under this part may be used for eligible activities to serve unaccompanied youth and homeless families and children defined as homeless under section 11302(a)(6) of this title only pursuant to paragraph (1) of this subsection and such families and children shall not otherwise be considered as homeless for purposes of this part.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) At risk of homelessness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subparagraph (A) may not be construed to prevent any unaccompanied youth and homeless families and children defined as homeless under section 11302(a)(6) of this title from qualifying for, and being treated for purposes of this part as, at risk of homelessness or from eligibility for any projects, activities, or services carried out using amounts provided under this part for which individuals or families that are at risk of homelessness are eligible.</p>
