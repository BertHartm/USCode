<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each department, agency, and instrumentality of the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the Federal Government (1) having jurisdiction over any solid waste management facility or disposal site, or (2) engaged in any activity resulting, or which may result, in the disposal or management of solid waste or hazardous waste shall be subject to, and comply with, all Federal, State, interstate, and local requirements, both substantive and procedural (including any requirement for permits or reporting or any provisions for injunctive relief and such sanctions as may be imposed by a court to enforce such relief), respecting control and abatement of solid waste or hazardous waste disposal and management in the same manner, and to the same extent, as any person is subject to such requirements, including the payment of reasonable service charges. The Federal, State, interstate, and local substantive and procedural requirements referred to in this subsection include, but are not limited to, all administrative orders and all civil and administrative penalties and fines, regardless of whether such penalties or fines are punitive or coercive in nature or are imposed for isolated, intermittent, or continuing violations. The United States hereby expressly waives any immunity otherwise applicable to the United States with respect to any such substantive or procedural requirement (including, but not limited to, any injunctive relief, administrative order or civil or administrative penalty or fine referred to in the preceding sentence, or reasonable service charge). The reasonable service charges referred to in this subsection include, but are not limited to, fees or charges assessed in connection with the processing and issuance of permits, renewal of permits, amendments to permits, review of plans, studies, and other documents, and inspection and monitoring of facilities, as well as any other nondiscriminatory charges that are assessed in connection with a Federal, State, interstate, or local solid waste or hazardous waste regulatory program. Neither the United States, nor any agent, employee, or officer thereof, shall be immune or exempt from any process or sanction of any State or Federal Court with respect to the enforcement of any such injunctive relief. No agent, employee, or officer of the United States shall be personally liable for any civil penalty under any Federal, State, interstate, or local solid or hazardous waste law with respect to any act or omission within the scope of the official duties of the agent, employee, or officer. An agent, employee, or officer of the United States shall be subject to any criminal sanction (including, but not limited to, any fine or imprisonment) under any Federal or State solid or hazardous waste law, but no department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government shall be subject to any such sanction. The President may exempt any solid waste management facility of any department, agency, or instrumentality in the executive branch from compliance with such a requirement if he determines it to be in the paramount interest of the United States to do so. No such exemption shall be granted due to lack of appropriation unless the President shall have specifically requested such appropriation as a part of the budgetary process and the Congress shall have failed to make available such requested appropriation. Any exemption shall be for a period not in excess of one year, but additional exemptions may be granted for periods not to exceed one year upon the President's making a new determination. The President shall report each January to the Congress all exemptions from the requirements of this section granted during the preceding calendar year, together with his reason for granting each such exemption.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administrative enforcement actions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator may commence an administrative enforcement action against any department, agency, or instrumentality of the executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Federal Government pursuant to the enforcement authorities contained in this chapter. The Administrator shall initiate an administrative enforcement action against such a department, agency, or instrumentality in the same manner and under the same circumstances as an action would be initiated against another person. Any voluntary resolution or settlement of such an action shall be set forth in a consent order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No administrative order issued to such a department, agency, or instrumentality shall become final until such department, agency, or instrumentality has had the opportunity to confer with the Administrator.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Limitation on State use of funds collected from Federal Government</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless a State law in effect on October 6, 1992, or a State constitution requires the funds to be used in a different manner, all funds collected by a State from the Federal Government from penalties and fines imposed for violation of any substantive or procedural requirement referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall be used by the State only for projects designed to improve or protect the environment or to defray the costs of environmental protection or enforcement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, a procuring agency shall comply with the requirements set forth in this section and any regulations issued under this section, with respect to any purchase or acquisition of a procurement item where the purchase price of the item exceeds $10,000 or where the quantity of such items or of functionally equivalent items purchased or acquired in the course of the preceding fiscal year was $10,000 or more.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Procurement subject to other law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any procurement, by any procuring agency, which is subject to regulations of the Administrator under section 6964 of this title (as promulgated before October 21, 1976, under comparable provisions of prior law) shall not be subject to the requirements of this section to the extent that such requirements are inconsistent with such regulations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) After the date specified in applicable guidelines prepared pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, each procuring agency which procures any items designated in such guidelines shall procure such items composed of the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable (and in the case of paper, the highest percentage of the postconsumer recovered materials referred to in subsection (h)(1) of this section practicable), consistent with maintaining a satisfactory level of competition, considering such guidelines. The decision not to procure such items shall be based on a determination that such procurement items&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5653 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are not reasonably available within a reasonable period of time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) fail to meet the performance standards set forth in the applicable specifications or fail to meet the reasonable performance standards of the procuring agencies; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) After the date specified in any applicable guidelines prepared pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, contracting officers shall require that vendors:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) certify that the percentage of recovered materials to be used in the performance of the contract will be at least the amount required by applicable specifications or other contractual requirements and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) estimate the percentage of the total material utilized for the performance of the contract which is recovered materials.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) applies only to a contract in an amount greater than $100,000.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Specifications</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All Federal agencies that have the responsibility for drafting or reviewing specifications for procurement items procured by Federal agencies shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) as expeditiously as possible but in any event no later than eighteen months after November 8, 1984, eliminate from such specifications&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any exclusion of recovered materials and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any requirement that items be manufactured from virgin materials; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) within one year after the date of publication of applicable guidelines under subsection (e) of this section, or as otherwise specified in such guidelines, assure that such specifications require the use of recovered materials to the maximum extent possible without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator, after consultation with the Administrator of General Services, the Secretary of Commerce (acting through the National Institute of Standards and Technology), and the Public Printer, shall prepare, and from time to time revise, guidelines for the use of procuring agencies in complying with the requirements of this section. Such guidelines shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) designate those items which are or can be produced with recovered materials and whose procurement by procuring agencies will carry out the objectives of this section, and in the case of paper, provide for maximizing the use of post consumer recovered materials referred to in subsection (h)(1) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) set forth recommended practices with respect to the procurement of recovered materials and items containing such materials and with respect to certification by vendors of the percentage of recovered materials used,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">and shall provide information as to the availability, relative price, and performance of such materials and items and where appropriate shall recommend the level of recovered material to be contained in the procured product. The Administrator shall prepare final guidelines for paper within one hundred and eighty days after November 8, 1984, and for three additional product categories (including tires) by October 1, 1985. In making the designation under paragraph (1), the Administrator shall consider, but is not limited in his considerations, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the availability of such items;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the impact of the procurement of such items by procuring agencies on the volume of solid waste which must be treated, stored or disposed of;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the economic and technological feasibility of producing and using such items; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) other uses for such recovered materials.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Procurement of services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A procuring agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, manage or arrange for the procurement of solid waste management services in a manner which maximizes energy and resource recovery.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Executive Office</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Office of Procurement Policy in the Executive Office of the President, in cooperation with the Administrator, shall implement the requirements of this section. It shall be the responsibility of the Office of Procurement Policy to coordinate this policy with other policies for Federal procurement, in such a way as to maximize the use of recovered resources, and to, every two years beginning in 1984, report to the Congress on actions taken by Federal agencies and the progress made in the implementation of this section, including agency compliance with subsection (d) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) &ldquo;Recovered materials&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, in the case of paper products, the term &ldquo;recovered materials&rdquo; includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) postconsumer materials such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) paper, paperboard, and fibrous wastes from retail stores, office buildings, homes, and so forth, after they have passed through their end-usage as a consumer item, including: used corrugated boxes; old newspapers; old magazines; mixed waste paper; tabulating cards; and used cordage; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) all paper, paperboard, and fibrous wastes that enter and are collected from municipal solid waste, and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) manufacturing, forest residues, and other wastes such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) dry paper and paperboard waste generated after completion of the papermaking process (that is, those manufacturing operations up to and including the cutting and trimming of the paper machine reel into smaller rolls or rough sheets) including: en<!-- PDFPage:5654 -->velope cuttings, bindery trimmings, and other paper and paperboard waste, resulting from printing, cutting, forming, and other converting operations; bag, box, and carton manufacturing wastes; and butt rolls, mill wrappers, and rejected unused stock; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) finished paper and paperboard from obsolete inventories of paper and paperboard manufacturers, merchants, wholesalers, dealers, printers, converters, or others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) fibrous byproducts of harvesting, manufacturing, extractive, or wood-cutting processes, flax, straw, linters, bagasse, slash, and other forest residues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) wastes generated by the conversion of goods made from fibrous material (that is, waste rope from cordage manufacture, textile mill waste, and cuttings); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) fibers recovered from waste water which otherwise would enter the waste stream.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Procurement program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Within one year after the date of publication of applicable guidelines under subsection (e) of this section, each procuring agency shall develop an affirmative procurement program which will assure that items composed of recovered materials will be purchased to the maximum extent practicable and which is consistent with applicable provisions of Federal procurement law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each affirmative procurement program required under this subsection shall, at a minimum, contain&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a recovered materials preference program;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an agency promotion program to promote the preference program adopted under subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a program for requiring estimates of the total percentage of recovered material utilized in the performance of a contract; certification of minimum recovered material content actually utilized, where appropriate; and reasonable verification procedures for estimates and certifications; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) annual review and monitoring of the effectiveness of an agency's affirmative procurement program.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In the case of paper, the recovered materials preference program required under subparagraph (A) shall provide for the maximum use of the post consumer recovered materials referred to in subsection (h)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In developing the preference program, the following options shall be considered for adoption:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) Case-by-Case Policy Development: Subject to the limitations of subsection (c)(1)(A) through (C) of this section, a policy of awarding contracts to the vendor offering an item composed of the highest percentage of recovered materials practicable (and in the case of paper, the highest percentage of the post consumer recovered materials referred to in subsection (h)(1) of this section). Subject to such limitations, agencies may make an award to a vendor offering items with less than the maximum recovered materials content.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Minimum Content Standards: Minimum recovered materials content specifications which are set in such a way as to assure that the recovered materials content (and in the case of paper, the content of post consumer materials referred to in subsection (h)(1) of this section) required is the maximum available without jeopardizing the intended end use of the item, or violating the limitations of subsection (c)(1)(A) through (C) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Procuring agencies shall adopt one of the options set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B) or a substantially equivalent alternative, for inclusion in the affirmative procurement program.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Administrator, in cooperation with the Secretary of Transportation and the Secretary of Energy, shall conduct a study to determine the extent to which current procurement requirements, when fully implemented in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, may realize energy savings and environmental benefits attainable with substitution of recovered mineral component in cement used in cement or concrete projects.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Matters to be addressed</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The study shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) quantify the extent to which recovered mineral components are being substituted for Portland cement, particularly as a result of current procurement requirements, and the energy savings and environmental benefits associated with that substitution;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) identify all barriers in procurement requirements to greater realization of energy savings and environmental benefits, including barriers resulting from exceptions from current law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C)(i) identify potential mechanisms to achieve greater substitution of recovered mineral component in types of cement or concrete projects for which recovered mineral components historically have not been used or have been used only minimally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) evaluate the feasibility of establishing guidelines or standards for optimized substitution rates of recovered mineral component in those cement or concrete projects; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) identify any potential environmental or economic effects that may result from greater substitution of recovered mineral component in those cement or concrete projects.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 30 months after August 10, 2005, the Administrator shall submit to Congress a report on the study.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Additional procurement requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Unless the study conducted under subsection (c) of this section identifies any effects or other problems described in subsection (c)(2)(C)(iii) of this section that warrant further review or delay, the Administrator and each agency head shall, not later than 1 year after the release of the report in accordance with subsection (c)(3) of this section, take additional actions authorized under this chapter to establish procurement requirements and incentives that provide for the use of cement and concrete with increased substitution of recovered mineral component in the construction and maintenance of cement or concrete projects, so as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) realize more fully the energy savings and environmental benefits associated with increased substitution; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) eliminate barriers identified under subsection (c) of this section.</p>
