<p class="statutory-body-1em">A skilled nursing facility must provide services to attain or maintain the highest practicable physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of each resident, in accordance with a written plan of care which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(III) The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under this clause in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Use of independent assessors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If a State determines, under a survey under subsection (g) of this section or otherwise, that there has been a knowing and willful certification of false assessments under this paragraph, the State may require (for a period specified by the State) that resident assessments under this paragraph be conducted and certified by individuals who are independent of the facility and who are approved by the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Frequency</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Extended surveys</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Each skilled nursing facility which is found, under a standard survey, to have provided substandard quality of care shall be subject to an extended survey. Any other facility may, at the Secretary's or State's discretion, be subject to such an extended survey (or a partial extended survey).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Timing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The extended survey shall be conducted immediately after the standard survey (or, if not practicable, not later than 2 weeks after the date of completion of the standard survey).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Contents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In such an extended survey, the survey team shall review and identify the policies and procedures which produced such substandard quality of care and shall determine whether the facility has complied with all the requirements described in subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section. Such review shall include an expansion of the size of the sample of residents&rsquo; assessments reviewed and a review of the staffing, of in-service training, and, if appropriate, of contracts with consultants.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Nothing in this paragraph shall be construed as requiring an extended or partial extended survey as a prerequisite to imposing a sanction against a facility under subsection (h) of this section on the basis of findings in a standard survey.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Survey protocol</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Standard and extended surveys shall be conducted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) based upon a protocol which the Secretary has developed, tested, and validated by not later than January 1, 1990, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) by individuals, of a survey team, who meet such minimum qualifications as the Secretary establishes by not later than such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The failure of the Secretary to develop, test, or validate such protocols or to establish such minimum qualifications shall not relieve any State of its responsibility (or the Secretary of the Secretary's responsibility) to conduct surveys under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Consistency of surveys</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State and the Secretary shall implement programs to measure and reduce inconsistency in the application of survey results among surveyors.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Survey teams</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">A State may not use as a member of a survey team under this subsection an individual who is serving (or has served within the previous 2 years) as a member of the staff of, or as a consultant to, the facility surveyed respecting compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, or who has a personal or familial financial interest in the facility being surveyed.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Training</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall provide for the comprehensive training of State and Federal surveyors in the conduct of standard and extended surveys under this subsection, including the auditing of resident assessments and plans of care. No individual shall serve as a member of a survey team unless the individual has successfully completed a training and testing program in survey and certification techniques that has been approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Validation surveys</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall conduct onsite surveys of a representative sample of skilled nursing facilities in each State, within 2 months of the date of surveys conducted under paragraph (2) by the State, in a sufficient number to allow inferences about the adequacies of each State's surveys conducted under paragraph (2). In conducting such surveys, the Secretary shall use the same survey protocols as the State is required to use under paragraph (2). If the State has determined that an individual skilled nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but the Secretary determines that the facility does not meet such requirements, the Secretary's determination as to the facility's noncompliance with such requirements is binding and supersedes that of the State survey.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Scope</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to each State, the Secretary shall conduct surveys under subparagraph (A) each year with respect to at least 5 percent of the number of skilled nursing facilities surveyed by the State in the year, but in no case less than 5 skilled nursing facilities in the State.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2213 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Remedies for substandard performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the Secretary finds, on the basis of such surveys, that a State has failed to perform surveys as required under paragraph (2) or that a State's survey and certification performance otherwise is not adequate, the Secretary shall provide for an appropriate remedy, which may include the training of survey teams in the State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Special surveys of compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Where the Secretary has reason to question the compliance of a skilled nursing facility with any of the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, the Secretary may conduct a survey of the facility and, on the basis of that survey, make independent and binding determinations concerning the extent to which the skilled nursing facility meets such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Investigation of complaints and monitoring compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State shall maintain procedures and adequate staff to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) investigate complaints of violations of requirements by skilled nursing facilities, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) monitor, on-site, on a regular, as needed basis, a skilled nursing facility's compliance with the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the facility has been found not to be in compliance with such requirements and is in the process of correcting deficiencies to achieve such compliance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the facility was previously found not to be in compliance with such requirements, has corrected deficiencies to achieve such compliance, and verification of continued compliance is indicated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the State has reason to question the compliance of the facility with such requirements.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">A State may maintain and utilize a specialized team (including an attorney, an auditor, and appropriate health care professionals) for the purpose of identifying, surveying, gathering and preserving evidence, and carrying out appropriate enforcement actions against substandard skilled nursing facilities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Disclosure of results of inspections and activities</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Public information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each State, and the Secretary, shall make available to the public&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Enforcement process</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a State finds, on the basis of a standard, extended, or partial extended survey under subsection (g)(2) of this section or otherwise, that a skilled nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and further finds that the facility's deficiencies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the State shall recommend to the Secretary that the Secretary take such action as described in paragraph (2)(A)(i); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If a State finds that a skilled nursing facility meets the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section, but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the State may recommend a civil money penalty under paragraph (2)(B)(ii) for the days in which it finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Secretarial authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to any skilled nursing facility in a State, if the Secretary finds, or pursuant to a recommendation of the State under paragraph (1) finds, that a skilled nursing facility no longer meets a requirement of subsection (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this <!-- PDFPage:2214 -->section, and further finds that the facility's deficiencies&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in subparagraph (B)(iii), or terminate the facility's participation under this subchapter and may provide, in addition, for one or more of the other remedies described in subparagraph (B); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) do not immediately jeopardize the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary may impose any of the remedies described in subparagraph (B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Nothing in this subparagraph shall be construed as restricting the remedies available to the Secretary to remedy a skilled nursing facility's deficiencies. If the Secretary finds, or pursuant to the recommendation of the State under paragraph (1) finds, that a skilled nursing facility meets such requirements but, as of a previous period, did not meet such requirements, the Secretary may provide for a civil money penalty under subparagraph (B)(ii) for the days on which he finds that the facility was not in compliance with such requirements.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Specified remedies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may take the following actions with respect to a finding that a facility has not met an applicable requirement:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">In consultation with the State, the Secretary may appoint temporary management to oversee the operation of the facility and to assure the health and safety of the facility's residents, where there is a need for temporary management while&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) improvements are made in order to bring the facility into compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;The temporary management under this clause shall not be terminated under subclause (II) until the Secretary has determined that the facility has the management capability to ensure continued compliance with all the requirements of subsections (b), (c), and (d) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

In addition, the Secretary may provide for other specified remedies, such as directed plans of correction.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the State survey agency finds that it is more appropriate to take alternative action to assure compliance of the facility with the requirements than to terminate the certification of the facility,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the State has submitted a plan and timetable for corrective action to the Secretary for approval and the Secretary approves the plan of corrective action, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the facility agrees to repay to the Federal Government payments received under this subparagraph if the corrective action is not taken in accordance with the approved plan and timetable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary finds that a skilled nursing facility has not met a requirement of subsection (b), (c), or (d) of this section, and finds that the failure immediately jeopardizes the health or safety of its residents, the Secretary shall take immediate action to remove the jeopardy and correct the deficiencies through the remedy specified in paragraph (2)(B)(iii), or the Secretary shall terminate the facility's participation under this subchapter. If the facility's participation under this subchapter is terminated, the State shall provide for the safe and orderly transfer of the residents eligible under this subchapter consistent with the requirements of subsection (c)(2) of this section.</p>
