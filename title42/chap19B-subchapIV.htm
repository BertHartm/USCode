<p class="statutory-body">Agreements entered into pursuant to this section shall (1) fully describe the work to be accomplished by the non-Federal public body, and be accompanied by an engineering plan if necessary therefor; (2) specify the manner in which such work shall be carried out; (3) provide for necessary review of design and plans, and inspection of the work by the Chief of Engineers or his designee; (4) state the basis on which the amount of reimbursement shall be determined; (5) state that such reimbursement shall be dependent upon the appropriation of funds applicable thereto or funds available therefor, and shall not take precedence over other pending projects of higher priority for improvements; and (6) specify that reimbursement or credit for non-Federal installation expenditures shall apply only to work undertaken on Federal projects after project authorization and execution of the agreement, and does not apply retroactively to past non-Federal work. Each such agreement shall expire three years after the date on which it is executed if the work to be undertaken by the non-Federal public body has not commenced before the expiration of that period. The time allowed for completion of the work will be determined by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, and stated in the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification of performance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No reimbursement shall be made, and no expenditure shall be credited, pursuant to this section, unless and until the Chief of Engineers or his designee, has certified that the work for which reimbursement or credit is requested has been performed in accordance with the agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Beach erosion control projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursement for work commenced by non-Federal public bodies no later than one year after August 13, 1968, to carry out or assist in carrying out projects for beach erosion control, may be made in accordance with the provisions of section 426f of title 33.

Expenditures for projects for beach erosion control commenced by non-Federal public bodies subsequent to one year after August 13, 1968, may be reimbursed by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, only in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prohibition of construction for Federal assumption of responsibilities of non-Federal bodies or for Federal liability for unnecessary or inapplicable project work of such bodies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not be construed (1) as authorizing the United States to assume any responsibilities placed upon a non-Federal body by the conditions of project authorization, or (2) as committing the United States to reimburse non-Federal interests if the Federal project is not undertaken or is modified so as to make the work performed by the non-Federal Public body no longer applicable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Allotment limitation for any fiscal year; specific project reimbursement authorizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Army is authorized to allot from any appropriations hereafter made for civil works, not to exceed $10,000,000 for any one fiscal year to carry out the provisions of this section. This limitation does not include specific project authorizations providing for reimbursement.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Cooperation of non-Federal interest</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">After December 31, 1970, the construction of any water resources project, or an acceptable separable element thereof, by the Secretary of the Army, acting through the Chief of Engineers, or by a non-Federal interest where such interest will be reimbursed for such construction under any provision of law, shall not be commenced until each non-Federal interest has entered into a written partnership agreement with the Secretary (or, where appropriate, the district engineer for the district in which the project will be carried out) under which each party agrees to carry out its responsibilities and requirements for implementation or construction of the project or the appropriate element of the project, as the case may be; except that no such agreement shall be required if the Secretary determines that the administrative costs associated with negotiating, executing, or administering the agreement would exceed the amount of the contribution required from the non-Federal interest and are less than $25,000.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Liquidated damages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) may include a provision for liquidated damages in the event of a failure of one or more parties to perform.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Obligation of future appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In any partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) and entered into by a State, or a body politic of the State which derives its powers from the State constitution, or a governmental entity created by the State legislature, the agreement may reflect that it does not obligate future appropriations for such performance and payment when obligating future appropriations would be inconsistent with constitutional or statutory limitations of the State or a political subdivision of the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Credit for in-kind contributions</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A partnership agreement described in paragraph (1) may provide with respect to a project that the Secretary shall credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of the project, including a project implemented without specific authorization in law, the value of in-kind contributions made by the non-Federal interest, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the costs of planning (including data collection), design, management, mitigation, construction, and construction services that are provided by the non-Federal interest for implementation of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the value of materials or services provided before execution of the partnership agreement, including efforts on constructed elements incorporated into the project; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) the value of materials and services provided after execution of the partnership agreement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Condition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may credit an in-kind contribution under subparagraph (A) only if the Secretary determines that the material or service provided as an in-kind contribution is integral to the project.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Work performed before partnership agreement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In any case in which the non-Federal interest is to receive credit under subparagraph (A)(ii) for the cost of work carried out by the non-Federal interest and such work has not been carried out as of November 8, 2007, the Secretary and the non-Federal interest shall enter into an agreement under which the non-Federal interest shall carry out such work, and only work carried out following the execution of the agreement shall be eligible for credit.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Credit authorized under this paragraph for a project&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) shall not exceed the non-Federal share of the cost of the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) shall not alter any other requirement that a non-Federal interest provide lands, easements, relocations, rights-of-way, or areas for disposal of dredged material for the project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) shall not alter any requirement that a non-Federal interest pay a portion of the costs of construction of the project under sections 2211 and 2213 of title 33; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) shall not exceed the actual and reasonable costs of the materials, services, or other things provided by the non-Federal interest, as determined by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Applicability</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">This paragraph shall apply to water resources projects authorized after November 16, 1986, including projects initiated <!-- PDFPage:3679 -->after November 16, 1986, without specific authorization in law.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In any case in which a specific provision of law provides for a non-Federal interest to receive credit toward the non-Federal share of the cost of a study for, or construction or operation and maintenance of, a water resources project, the specific provision of law shall apply instead of this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Definition of non-Federal interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The term &ldquo;non-Federal interest&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a legally constituted public body (including a federally recognized Indian tribe); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a nonprofit entity with the consent of the affected local government,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">After commencement of construction of a project, the Chief of Engineers may undertake performance of those items of cooperation necessary to the functioning of the project for its purposes, if he has first notified the non-Federal interest of its failure to perform the terms of its agreement and has given such interest a reasonable time after such notification to so perform.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Delegation of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than June 30, 2008, the Secretary shall issue policies and guidelines for partnership agreements that delegate to the district engineers, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the authority to approve any policy in a partnership agreement that has appeared in an agreement previously approved by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the authority to approve any policy in a partnership agreement the specific terms of which are dictated by law or by a final feasibility study, final environmental impact statement, or other final decision document for a water resources project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the authority to approve any partnership agreement that complies with the policies and guidelines issued by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the authority to sign any partnership agreement for any water resources project unless, within 30 days of the date of authorization of the project, the Secretary notifies the district engineer in which the project will be carried out that the Secretary wishes to retain the prerogative to sign the partnership agreement for that project.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 2 years after November 8, 2007, and every year thereafter, the Secretary shall submit to Congress a report detailing the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The number of partnership agreements signed by district engineers and the number of partnership agreements signed by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For any partnership agreement signed by the Secretary, an explanation of why delegation to the district engineer was not appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Public availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 120 days after November 8, 2007, the Chief of Engineers shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) ensure that each district engineer has made available to the public, including on the Internet, all partnership agreements entered into under this section within the preceding 10 years and all partnership agreements for water resources projects currently being carried out in that district; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make each partnership agreement entered into after November 8, 2007, available to the public, including on the Internet, not later than 7 days after the date on which such agreement is entered into.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">This section shall not apply to any project the construction of which was commenced before January 1, 1972, or to the assurances for future demands required by the Water Supply Act of 1958, as amended [43 U.S.C. 390b].</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the Great Lakes are a most important natural resource to the eight Great Lakes States and two Canadian provinces, providing water supply for domestic and industrial use, clean energy through hydropower production, an efficient transportation mode for moving products into and out of the Great Lakes region, and recreational uses for millions of United States and Canadian citizens;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the Great Lakes need to be carefully managed and protected to meet current and future needs within the Great Lakes basin and Canadian provinces;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any new diversions of Great Lakes water for use outside of the Great Lakes basin will have significant economic and environmental impacts, adversely affecting the use of this resource by the Great Lakes States and Canadian provinces; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) four of the Great Lakes are international waters and are defined as boundary waters in the Boundary Waters Treaty of 1909 between the United States and Canada, and as such any new diversion of Great Lakes water in the United States would affect the relations of the Government of the United States with the Government of Canada.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional declaration of purpose and policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is therefore declared to be the purpose and policy of the Congress in this section&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Approval by Governors for diversion of water</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No water shall be diverted or exported from any portion of the Great Lakes within the United States, or from any tributary within the United States of any of the Great Lakes, for use outside the Great Lakes basin unless such diversion or export is approved by the Governor of each of the Great Lake&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1962d-20_1_target" name="1962d-20_1">1</a></sup> States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Approval of Governors for diversion studies</h4>
