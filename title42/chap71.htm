<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the current imbalance between supply and demand for fuels and energy is likely to persist for some time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the early demonstration of the feasibility of using solar energy for the heating and cooling of buildings could help to relieve the demand upon present fuel and energy supplies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the technologies for solar heating are close to the point of commercial application in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the technologies for combined solar heating and cooling still require research, development, testing and demonstration, but no insoluble technical problem is now foreseen in achieving commercial use of such technologies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the early development and export of viable solar heating equipment and combined solar heating and cooling equipment, consistent with the established preeminence of the United States in the field of high technology products, can make a valuable contribution to our balance of trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the widespread use of solar energy in place of conventional methods for the heating and cooling of buildings would have a significantly beneficial effect upon the environment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the mass production and use of solar heating and cooling equipment will help to eliminate the dependence of the United States upon foreign energy sources and promote the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the widespread introduction of low-cost solar energy will be beneficial to consumers in a period of rapidly rising fuel cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) innovation and creativity in the development of solar heating and combined solar heating and cooling components and systems can be fostered through encouraging direct contact between the manufacturers of such systems and the architects, engineers, developers, contractors, and other persons interested in installing such systems in buildings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) evaluation of the performance and reliability of solar heating and combined solar heating and cooling technologies can be expedited by testing under carefully controlled conditions; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) commercial application of solar heating and combined solar heating and cooling technologies can be expedited by early commercial demonstration under practical conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) It is therefore declared to be the policy of the United States and the purpose of this subchapter to provide for the demonstration within a three-year period of the practical use of solar heating technology, and to provide for the development and demonstration within a five-year period of the practical use of combined heating and cooling technology.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the needs of a viable society depend on an ample supply of energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the current imbalance between domestic supply and demand for fuels and energy is likely to persist for some time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) dependence on nonrenewable energy resources cannot be continued indefinitely, particularly at current rates of consumption;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) it is in the Nation's interest to expedite the long-term development of renewable and nonpolluting energy resources, such as solar energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the various solar energy technologies are today at widely differing stages of development, with some already near the stage of commercial application and others still requiring basic research;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4909 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the early development and export of viable equipment utilizing solar energy, consistent with the established preeminence of the United States in the field of high technology products, can make a valuable contribution to our balance of trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the mass production and use of equipment utilizing solar energy will help to eliminate the dependence of the United States upon foreign energy sources and promote the national defense;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to date, the national effort in research, development, and demonstration activities relating to the utilization of solar energy has been extremely limited; therefore</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the urgency of the Nation's critical energy shortages and the need to make clean and renewable energy alternatives commercially viable require that the Nation undertake an intensive research, development, and demonstration program with an estimated Federal investment which may reach or exceed $1,000,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress declares that it is the policy of the Federal Government to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States of America is faced with a finite and diminishing resource base of native fossil fuels, and as a consequence must develop as quickly as possible a diversified, pluralistic national energy capability and posture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the current imbalance between supply and demand for fuels and energy in the United States is likely to grow for many years;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:4915 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the early demonstration of the feasibility of using solar photovoltaic energy systems for the generation of electricity could help to relieve the demand on existing fuel and energy supplies;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the national security and economic well-being of the United States is endangered by its dependence on imported energy supplies which are subject to resource limitations, artificial pricing mechanisms which do not accurately reflect supply and demand relationships, and supply interruptions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the early development and widespread utilization of photovoltaic energy systems could significantly expand the domestic energy resource base of the United States, thereby lessening its dependence on foreign supplies;</p>
