The annual contract amount for any project shall not exceed the sum of the initial annual project rentals for all units and any initial utility allowances for such units, as approved by the Secretary. Any contract amounts not used by a project in any year shall remain available to the project until the expiration of the contract. The Secretary may adjust the annual contract amount if the sum of the project income and the amount of assistance payments available under this paragraph are inadequate to provide for reasonable project costs. In the case of an intermediate care facility which is the residence of persons assisted under title XIX of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], project income under this paragraph shall include the same amount as if such person were being assisted under title XVI of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1381 et seq.].</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Development cost limitations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall periodically establish development cost limitations by market area for various types and sizes of supportive housing for persons with disabilities by publishing a notice of the cost limitations in the Federal Register. The cost limitations shall reflect&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the cost of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation of supportive housing for persons with disabilities that (i) meets applicable State and local housing and building codes; and (ii) conforms with the design characteristics of the neighborhood in which it is to be located;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">In establishing development cost limitations for a given market area, the Secretary shall use data that reflect currently prevailing costs of acquisition, construction, reconstruction, or rehabilitation, and land acquisition in the area. Neither this section nor any other provision of law may be construed as prohibiting or preventing the location and operation, in a project assisted under this section, of commercial facilities for the benefit of residents of the project and the community in which the project is located, except that assistance made available under this section may not be used to subsidize any such commercial facility.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) RTC properties</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Incentives for savings</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Special project account</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall use the development cost limitations established under paragraph (1) to calculate the amount of financing to be made available to individual owners. Owners which incur actual development costs that are less than the amount of financing shall be entitled to retain 50 percent of the savings in a special project account. Such percentage shall be increased to 75 percent for owners which add energy efficiency features which (i) exceed the energy efficiency standards promulgated by the Secretary in accordance with section 12709 of this title; (ii) substantially reduce the life-cycle cost of the housing; (iii) reduce gross rent requirements; and (iv) enhance tenant comfort and convenience.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Uses</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Notice of appeal</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall notify an owner not less than 30 days prior to canceling any reservation of assistance provided under this section.
