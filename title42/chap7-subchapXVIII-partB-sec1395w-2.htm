<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The Secretary shall develop and implement&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a range of intermediate sanctions to apply to providers or clinical laboratories under the conditions described in subsection (a), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) appropriate procedures for appealing determinations relating to the imposition of such sanctions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The intermediate sanctions developed under paragraph (1) shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) directed plans of correction,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) civil money penalties in an amount not to exceed $10,000 for each day of substantial noncompliance,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) payment for the costs of onsite monitoring by an agency responsible for conducting surveys, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than subsections (a) and (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under clause (ii) in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The sanctions specified in subparagraph (A) are in addition to sanctions otherwise available under State or Federal law.</p>
