<!-- PDFPage:1130 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) with respect to health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan (including such a plan that is a church plan or a governmental plan).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Treatment of non-Federal governmental plans</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Election to be excluded</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If the plan sponsor of a nonfederal&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-21_1_target" name="300gg-21_1">1</a></sup> governmental plan which is a group health plan to which the provisions of subparts 1 through 3 otherwise apply makes an election under this subparagraph (in such form and manner as the Secretary may by regulations prescribe), then the requirements of such subparts insofar as they apply directly to group health plans (and not merely to group health insurance coverage) shall not apply to such governmental plans for such period except as provided in this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Period of election</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">An election under subparagraph (A) shall apply&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) certification and disclosure of creditable coverage under the plan with respect to enrollees in accordance with section 300gg(e) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for certain benefits</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) are otherwise not an integral part of the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Noncoordinated, excepted benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of subparts 1 through 3 shall not apply to any group health plan (and group health insurance coverage offered in connection with a group health plan) in relation to its provision of excepted benefits described in section 300gg&ndash;91(c)(3) of this title if all of the following conditions are met:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The benefits are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) There is no coordination between the provision of such benefits and any exclusion of benefits under any group health plan maintained by the same plan sponsor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Such benefits are paid with respect to an event without regard to whether benefits are provided with respect to such an event under any group health plan maintained by the same plan sponsor.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Supplemental excepted benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The requirements of this part shall not apply to any group health plan (and group health insurance coverage) in relation to its provision of excepted benefits described in section 300gg&ndash;91(c)(4)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300gg-21_2_target" name="300gg-21_2">2</a></sup> of this title if the benefits are provided under a separate policy, certificate, or contract of insurance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Treatment of partnerships</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this part&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Treatment as a group health plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any plan, fund, or program which would not be (but for this subsection) an employee welfare benefit plan and which is established or maintained by a partnership, to the extent that such plan, fund, or program provides medical care (including items and services paid for as medical care) to present or former partners in the partnership or to their dependents (as defined under the terms of the plan, fund, or program), directly or through insurance, reimbursement, or otherwise, shall be treated (subject to paragraph (2)) as an employee welfare benefit plan which is a group health plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Employer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a group health plan, the term &ldquo;employer&rdquo; also includes the partnership in relation to any partner.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in connection with a group health plan maintained by a self-employed individual (under which one or more employees are participants), the self-employed individual,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">if such individual is, or may become, eligible to receive a benefit under the plan or such individual's beneficiaries may be eligible to receive any such benefit.</p>
