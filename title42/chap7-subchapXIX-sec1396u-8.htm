<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, the Secretary shall establish a demonstration program under which States may provide under their State plans under this subchapter (including such a plan operating under a statewide waiver under section 1315 of this title) in accordance with this section for the provision of alternative benefits consistent with subsection (c) for eligible population groups in one or more geographic areas of the State specified by the State. An amendment under the previous sentence is referred to in this section as a &ldquo;State demonstration program&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Initial demonstration</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The demonstration program under this section shall begin on January 1, 2007. During the first 5 years of such program, the Secretary shall not approve more than 10 States to conduct demonstration programs under this section, with each State demonstration program covering 1 or more geographic areas specified by the State. After such 5-year period&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that a State demonstration program previously implemented has been unsuccessful, such a demonstration program may be extended or made permanent in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) unless the Secretary finds, taking into account cost-effectiveness, quality of care, and other criteria that the Secretary specifies, that all State demonstration programs previously implemented were unsuccessful, other States may implement State demonstration programs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) GAO report</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Not later than 3 months after the end of the 5-year period described in subparagraph (A), the Comptroller General of the United States shall submit a report to Congress evaluating the demonstration programs conducted under this section during such period.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Out of any funds in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, there is appropriated to the Comptroller General of the United States, $550,000 for the period of fiscal years 2007 through 2010 to carry out clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Approval</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) Providing access to negotiated provider payment rates consistent with this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing a State demonstration program from providing incentives for patients obtaining appropriate preventive care (as defined for purposes of section 223(c)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), such as additional account contributions for an individual demonstrating healthy prevention practices.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) No requirement for statewideness</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section or any other provision of law shall be construed to require that a State must provide for the implementation of a State demonstration program on a Statewide&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1396u-8_1_target" name="1396u-8_1">1</a></sup> basis.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible population groups</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Voluntary participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An eligible individual shall be enrolled in a State demonstration program only if the individual voluntarily enrolls. Except in such hardship cases as the Secretary shall specify, such an enrollment shall be effective for a period of 12 months, but may be extended for additional periods of 12 months each with the consent of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) 1-year moratorium for reenrollment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) contribution into a health opportunity account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">Nothing in subparagraph (A) shall be construed as preventing a State from providing for coverage of preventive care (referred to in subsection (a)(3)) within the alternative benefits without regard to the annual deductible.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Annual deductible</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The amount of the annual deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) shall be at least 100 percent, but no more than 110 percent, of the annualized amount of contributions to the health opportunity account under subsection (d)(2)(A)(i), determined without regard to any limitation described in subsection (d)(2)(C)(i)(II).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) any participating provider under this subchapter at the same payment rates that would be applicable to such services if the deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) was not applicable; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) any other provider at payment rates that do not exceed 125 percent of the payment rate that would be applicable to such services furnished by a participating provider under this subchapter if the deductible described in paragraph (1)(A) was not applicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an individual who is participating in a State demonstration program and is enrolled with a Medicaid managed care organization, the State shall enter into an arrangement with the organization under which the individual may obtain demonstration program Medicaid services from any provider described in clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) at payment rates that do not exceed the payment rates that may be imposed under that clause.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Computation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The payment rates described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) shall be computed without regard to any cost sharing that would be otherwise applicable under sections 1396<em>o</em> and 1396<em>o</em>&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
