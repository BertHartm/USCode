<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 90 days after March 23, 2010, the Secretary shall establish a temporary high risk health insurance pool program to provide health insurance coverage for eligible individuals during the period beginning on the date on which such program is established and ending on January 1, 2014.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Administration</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary may carry out the program under this section directly or through contracts to eligible entities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Eligible entities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To be eligible for a contract under paragraph (1), an entity shall&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) agree to utilize contract funding to establish and administer a qualified high risk pool for eligible individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Maintenance of effort</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">To be eligible to enter into a contract with the Secretary under this subsection, a State shall agree not to reduce the annual amount the State expended for the operation of one or more State high risk pools during the year preceding the year in which such contract is entered into.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Qualified high risk pool</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts made available under this section shall be used to establish a qualified high risk pool that meets the requirements of paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A qualified high risk pool meets the requirements of this paragraph if such pool&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides to all eligible individuals health insurance coverage that does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such coverage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides health insurance coverage&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) in which the issuer's share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under such coverage is not less than 65 percent of such costs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that has an out of pocket limit not greater than the applicable amount described in section 223(c)(2) of title 26 for the year involved, except that the Secretary may modify such limit if necessary to ensure the pool meets the actuarial value limit under clause (i);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) ensures that with respect to the premium rate charged for health insurance coverage offered to eligible individuals through the high risk pool, such rate shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) except as provided in clause (ii), vary only as provided for under section 300gg of this title (as amended by this Act and notwithstanding the date on which such amendments take effect);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) vary on the basis of age by a factor of not greater than 4 to 1; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) be established at a standard rate for a standard population; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) meets any other requirements determined appropriate by the Secretary.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has not been covered under creditable coverage (as defined in section 300gg(c)(1) of this title as in effect on March 23, 2010) during the 6-month period prior to the date on which such individual is applying for coverage through the high risk pool; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) has a pre-existing condition, as determined in a manner consistent with guidance issued by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Protection against dumping risk by insurers</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish criteria for determining whether health insurance issuers and employment-based health plans have discouraged an individual from remaining enrolled in prior coverage based on that individual's health status.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sanctions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An issuer or employment-based health plan shall be responsible for reimbursing the program under this section for the medical expenses incurred by the program for an individual who, based on criteria established by the Secretary, the Secretary finds was encouraged by the issuer to disenroll from health benefits coverage prior to enrolling in coverage through the program. The criteria shall include at least the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) In the case of prior coverage obtained through an employer, the provision by the employer, group health plan, or the issuer of money or other financial consideration for disenrolling from the coverage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) In the case of prior coverage obtained directly from an issuer or under an employment-based health plan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the provision by the issuer or plan of money or other financial consideration for disenrolling from the coverage; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of an individual whose premium for the prior coverage exceeded <!-- PDFPage:8121 -->the premium required by the program (adjusted based on the age factors applied to the prior coverage)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the prior coverage is a policy that is no longer being actively marketed (as defined by the Secretary) by the issuer; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the prior coverage is a policy for which duration of coverage form&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18001_1_target" name="18001_1">1</a></sup> issue or health status are factors that can be considered in determining premiums at renewal.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as constituting exclusive remedies for violations of criteria established under paragraph (1) or as preventing States from applying or enforcing such paragraph or other provisions under law with respect to health insurance issuers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Oversight</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an appeals process to enable individuals to appeal a determination under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) procedures to protect against waste, fraud, and abuse.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Funding; termination of authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">There is appropriated to the Secretary, out of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, $5,000,000,000 to pay claims against (and the administrative costs of) the high risk pool under this section that are in excess of the amount of premiums collected from eligible individuals enrolled in the high risk pool. Such funds shall be available without fiscal year limitation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Insufficient funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary estimates for any fiscal year that the aggregate amounts available for the payment of the expenses of the high risk pool will be less than the actual amount of such expenses, the Secretary shall make such adjustments as are necessary to eliminate such deficit.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Termination of authority</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), coverage of eligible individuals under a high risk pool in a State shall terminate on January 1, 2014.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Transition to Exchange</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall develop procedures to provide for the transition of eligible individuals enrolled in health insurance coverage offered through a high risk pool established under this section into qualified health plans offered through an Exchange. Such procedures shall ensure that there is no lapse in coverage with respect to the individual and may extend coverage after the termination of the risk pool involved, if the Secretary determines necessary to avoid such a lapse.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary has the authority to stop taking applications for participation in the program under this section to comply with the funding limitation provided for in paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Relation to State laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The standards established under this section shall supersede any State law or regulation (other than State licensing laws or State laws relating to plan solvency) with respect to qualified high risk pools which are established in accordance with this section.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Basis for claims</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Claims submitted under subparagraph (A) shall be based on the actual amount expended by the participating employment-based plan involved within the plan year for the health benefits provided to an early retiree or the spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent of such retiree. In determining the amount of a claim for purposes of this subsection, the participating employment-based plan shall take into account any negotiated price concessions (such as discounts, direct or indirect subsidies, rebates, and direct or indirect remunerations) obtained by such plan with respect to such health benefit. For purposes of determining the amount of any such claim, the costs paid by the early retiree or the retiree's spouse, surviving spouse, or dependent in the form of deductibles, co-payments, or co-insurance shall be included in the amounts paid by the participating employment-based plan.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Use of payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts paid to a participating employment-based plan under this subsection shall be used to lower costs for the plan. Such payments may be used to reduce premium costs for an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) or to reduce premium contributions, co-payments, deductibles, co-insurance, or other out-of-pocket costs for plan participants. Such payments shall not be used as general revenues for an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i). The Secretary shall develop a mechanism to monitor the appropriate use of such payments by such entities.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Payments not treated as income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Payments received under this subsection shall not be included in determining the gross income of an entity described in subsection (a)(2)(B)(i) that is maintaining or currently contributing to a participating employment-based plan.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) subject to subsection (e), provides either the bronze, silver, gold, or platinum level of coverage described in subsection (d).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Essential health benefits</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraph (2), the Secretary shall define the essential health benefits, except that such benefits shall include at least the following general categories and the items and services covered within the categories:</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limitation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall ensure that the scope of the essential health benefits under paragraph (1) is equal to the scope of benefits provided under a typical employer plan, as determined by the Secretary. To inform this determination, the Secretary of Labor shall conduct a survey of employer-sponsored coverage to determine the benefits typically covered by employers, including multiemployer plans, and provide a report on such survey to the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In defining the essential health benefits described in paragraph (1), and in revising the benefits under paragraph (4)(H), the Secretary shall submit a report to the appropriate committees of Congress containing a certification from the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services that such essential health benefits meet the limitation described in paragraph (2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take into account the health care needs of diverse segments of the population, including women, children, persons with disabilities, and other groups;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) ensure that health benefits established as essential not be subject to denial to individuals against their wishes on the basis of the individuals&rsquo; age or expected length of <!-- PDFPage:8127 -->life or of the individuals&rsquo; present or predicted disability, degree of medical dependency, or quality of life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) provide that a qualified health plan shall not be treated as providing coverage for the essential health benefits described in paragraph (1) unless the plan provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) coverage for emergency department services will be provided without imposing any requirement under the plan for prior authorization of services or any limitation on coverage where the provider of services does not have a contractual relationship with the plan for the providing of services that is more restrictive than the requirements or limitations that apply to emergency department services received from providers who do have such a contractual relationship with the plan; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if such services are provided out-of-network, the cost-sharing requirement (expressed as a copayment amount or coinsurance rate) is the same requirement that would apply if such services were provided in-network;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) provide that if a plan described in section 18031(b)(2)(B)(ii)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18022_3_target" name="18022_3">3</a></sup> of this title (relating to stand-alone dental benefits plans) is offered through an Exchange, another health plan offered through such Exchange shall not fail to be treated as a qualified health plan solely because the plan does not offer coverage of benefits offered through the stand-alone plan that are otherwise required under paragraph (1)(J); and&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18022_4_target" name="18022_4">4</a></sup></p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) periodically review the essential health benefits under paragraph (1), and provide a report to Congress and the public that contains&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) an assessment of whether enrollees are facing any difficulty accessing needed services for reasons of coverage or cost;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) an assessment of whether the essential health benefits needs to be modified or updated to account for changes in medical evidence or scientific advancement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) information on how the essential health benefits will be modified to address any such gaps in access or changes in the evidence base;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) an assessment of the potential of additional or expanded benefits to increase costs and the interactions between the addition or expansion of benefits and reductions in existing benefits to meet actuarial limitations described in paragraph (2); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) periodically update the essential health benefits under paragraph (1) to address any gaps in access to coverage or changes in the evidence base the Secretary identifies in the review conducted under subparagraph (G).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18022_1_target" name="18022_1">1</a></sup> shall be construed to prohibit a health plan from providing benefits in excess of the essential health benefits described in this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of other coverage, twice the amount in effect under clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The amounts under clauses (i) and (ii) may be increased by the maximum amount of reimbursement which is reasonably available to a participant under a flexible spending arrangement described in section 106(c)(2) of title 26 (determined without regard to any salary reduction arrangement).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Indexing of limits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of any plan year beginning in a calendar year after 2014&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the dollar amount under subparagraph (A)(i) shall be increased by an amount equal to the product of that amount and the premium adjustment percentage under paragraph (4) for the calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the dollar amount under subparagraph (A)(ii) shall be increased to an amount equal to twice the amount in effect under subparagraph (A)(i) for plan years beginning in the calendar year, determined after application of clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">If the amount of any increase under clause (i) is not a multiple of $50, such increase shall be rounded to the next lowest multiple of $50.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Actuarial value</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The limitation under this paragraph shall be applied in such a manner so as to not af<!-- PDFPage:8128 -->fect the actuarial value of any health plan, including a plan in the bronze level.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Cost-sharing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this title&mdash;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18022_1_target" name="18022_1">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall issue regulations under which employer contributions to a health savings account (within the meaning of section 223 of title 26) may be taken into account in determining the level of coverage for a plan of the employer.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining under this title,<sup><a href="#18022_1_target" name="18022_1">1</a></sup> the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.], or title 26 the percentage of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under a group health plan or health insurance coverage that are provided by such plan or coverage, the rules contained in the regulations under this paragraph shall apply.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Ex. Ord. No. 13535. Ensuring Enforcement and Implementation of Abortion Restrictions in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 13535, Mar. 24, 2010, 75 F.R. 15599, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the &ldquo;Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act&rdquo; (Public Law 111&ndash;148), I hereby order as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap>. 1. <em>Policy</em>. Following the recent enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;), it is necessary to establish an adequate enforcement mechanism to ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), consistent with a longstanding Federal statutory restriction that is commonly known as the Hyde Amendment. The purpose of this order is to establish a comprehensive, Government-wide set of policies and procedures to achieve this goal and to make certain that all relevant actors&mdash;Federal officials, State officials (including insurance regulators) and health care providers&mdash;are aware of their responsibilities, new and old.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Act maintains current Hyde Amendment restrictions governing abortion policy and extends those restrictions to the newly created health insurance exchanges. Under the Act, longstanding Federal laws to protect conscience (such as the Church Amendment, 42 U.S.C. 300a&ndash;7, and the Weldon Amendment, section 508(d)(1) of Public Law 111&ndash;8) remain intact and new protections prohibit discrimination against health care facilities and health care providers because of an unwillingness to provide, pay for, provide coverage of, or refer for abortions.</p>
<p class="note-body">Numerous executive agencies have a role in ensuring that these restrictions are enforced, including the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Strict Compliance with Prohibitions on Abortion Funding in Health Insurance Exchanges</em>. The Act specifically prohibits the use of tax credits and cost-sharing reduction payments to pay for abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered) in the health insurance exchanges that will be operational in 2014. The Act also imposes strict payment and accounting requirements to ensure that Federal funds are not used for abortion services in exchange plans (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered) and requires State health insurance commissioners to ensure that exchange plan funds are segregated by insurance companies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, OMB funds management circulars, and accounting guidance provided by the Government Accountability Office.</p>
<p class="note-body">I hereby direct the Director of the OMB and the Secretary of HHS to develop, within 180 days of the date of this order, a model set of segregation guidelines for State health insurance commissioners to use when determining whether exchange plans are complying with the Act's segregation requirements, established in section 1303 of the Act, for enrollees receiving Federal financial assistance. The guidelines shall also offer technical information that States should follow to conduct independent regular audits of insurance companies that participate in the health insurance exchanges. In developing these model guidelines, the Director of the OMB and the Secretary of HHS shall consult with executive agencies and offices that have relevant expertise in accounting principles, including, but not limited to, the Department of the Treasury, and with the Government Accountability Office. Upon completion of those model guidelines, the Secretary of HHS should promptly initiate a rulemaking to issue regulations, which will have the force of law, to interpret the Act's segregation requirements, and shall provide guidance to State health insurance commissioners on how to comply with the model guidelines.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Community Health Center Program</em>. The Act establishes a new Community Health Center (CHC) Fund within HHS, which provides additional Federal funds for the community health center program. Existing law prohibits these centers from using Federal funds to provide abortion services (except in cases of rape or incest, or when the life of the woman would be endangered), as a result of both the Hyde Amendment and longstanding regulations containing the Hyde language. Under the Act, the Hyde language shall apply to the authorization and appropriations of funds for Community Health Centers under section 10503 and all other relevant provisions. I hereby direct the Secretary of HHS to ensure that program administrators and recipients of Federal funds are aware of and comply with the limitations on abortion services imposed on CHCs by existing law. Such actions should include, but are not limited to, updating Grant Policy Statements that accompany CHC grants and issuing new interpretive rules.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>General Provisions</em>. (a) Nothing in this order shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect: (i) authority granted by law or Presidential directive to an agency, or the head thereof; or (ii) functions of the Director of the OMB relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This order shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) This order is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees or agents, or any other person.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">The amount determined under this paragraph for any fiscal year is the amount the Secretary determines is equal to 95 percent of the premium tax credits under sec<!-- PDFPage:8148 -->tion 36B of title 26, and the cost-sharing reductions under section 18071 of this title, that would have been provided for the fiscal year to eligible individuals enrolled in standard health plans in the State if such eligible individuals were allowed to enroll in qualified health plans through an Exchange established under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Specific requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall make the determination under clause (i) on a per enrollee basis and shall take into account all relevant factors necessary to determine the value of the premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions that would have been provided to eligible individuals described in clause (i), including the age and income of the enrollee, whether the enrollment is for self-only or family coverage, geographic differences in average spending for health care across rating areas, the health status of the enrollee for purposes of determining risk adjustment payments and reinsurance payments that would have been made if the enrollee had enrolled in a qualified health plan through an Exchange, and whether any reconciliation of the credit or cost-sharing reductions would have occurred if the enrollee had been so enrolled. This determination shall take into consideration the experience of other States with respect to participation in an Exchange and such credits and reductions provided to residents of the other States, with a special focus on enrollees with income below 200 percent of poverty.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Eligible insured</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;eligible insured&rdquo; means an individual&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Coordination with actuarial value limits</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall ensure the reduction under this paragraph shall not result in an increase in the plan's share of the total allowed costs of benefits provided under the plan above&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such individual shall be treated as an eligible insured; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuer of the plan shall eliminate any cost-sharing under the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Items or services furnished through Indian health providers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an Indian (as so defined) enrolled in a qualified health plan is furnished an item or service directly by the Indian Health Service, an Indian Tribe, Tribal Organization, or Urban Indian Organization or through referral under contract health services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no cost-sharing under the plan shall be imposed under the plan for such item or service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuer of the plan shall not reduce the payment to any such entity for such item or service by the amount of any cost-sharing that would be due from the Indian but for subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall pay to the issuer of a qualified health plan the amount necessary to reflect the increase in actuarial value of the plan required by reason of this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual who is an eligible insured is not lawfully present&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) no cost-sharing reduction under this section shall apply with respect to the individual; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for purposes of applying this section, the determination as to what percentage a taxpayer's household income bears to the poverty level for a family of the size involved shall be made under one of the following methods:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) A method under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the taxpayer's family size is determined by not taking such individuals into account, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the taxpayer's household income is equal to the product of the taxpayer's household income (determined without regard to this subsection) and a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(aa) the numerator of which is the poverty line for the taxpayer's family size determined after application of subclause (I), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-5em">(bb) the denominator of which is the poverty line for the taxpayer's family size determined without regard to subclause (I).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) A comparable method reaching the same result as the method under clause (i).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Lawfully present</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this section, an individual shall be treated as lawfully present only if the individual is, and is reasonably expected to be for the entire period of enrollment for which the cost-sharing reduction under this section is being claimed, a citizen or national of the United States or an alien lawfully present in the United States.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, shall prescribe rules <!-- PDFPage:8158 -->setting forth the methods by which calculations of family size and household income are made for purposes of this subsection. Such rules shall be designed to ensure that the least burden is placed on individuals enrolling in qualified health plans through an Exchange and taxpayers eligible for the credit allowable under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions and special rules</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any term used in this section which is also used in section 36B of title 26 shall have the meaning given such term by such section.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Data used for eligibility</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Any determination under this section shall be made on the basis of the taxable year for which the advance determination is made under section 18082 of this title and not the taxable year for which the credit under section 36B of title 26 is allowed.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall establish a system meeting the requirements of this section under which residents of each State may apply for enrollment in, receive a determination of eligibility <!-- PDFPage:8164 -->for participation in, and continue participation in, applicable State health subsidy programs. Such system shall ensure that if an individual applying to an Exchange is found through screening to be eligible for medical assistance under the State medicaid plan under title XIX&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18083_1_target" name="18083_1">1</a></sup> [42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.], or eligible for enrollment under a State children's health insurance program (CHIP) under title XXI of such Act [42 U.S.C. 1397aa et seq.], the individual is enrolled for assistance under such plan or program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Requirements relating to forms and notice</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Requirements relating to forms</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall develop and provide to each State a single, streamlined form that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) may be used to apply for all applicable State health subsidy programs within the State;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) may be filed online, in person, by mail, or by telephone;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) may be filed with an Exchange or with State officials operating one of the other applicable State health subsidy programs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) is structured to maximize an applicant's ability to complete the form satisfactorily, taking into account the characteristics of individuals who qualify for applicable State health subsidy programs.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) State authority to establish form</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A State may develop and use its own single, streamlined form as an alternative to the form developed under subparagraph (A) if the alternative form is consistent with standards promulgated by the Secretary under this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Supplemental eligibility forms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may allow a State to use a supplemental or alternative form in the case of individuals who apply for eligibility that is not determined on the basis of the household income (as defined in section 36B of title 26).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide that an applicant filing a form under paragraph (1) shall receive notice of eligibility for an applicable State health subsidy program without any need to provide additional information or paperwork unless such information or paperwork is specifically required by law when information provided on the form is inconsistent with data used for the electronic verification under paragraph (3) or is otherwise insufficient to determine eligibility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements relating to eligibility based on data exchanges</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Development of secure interfaces</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each State shall develop for all applicable State health subsidy programs a secure, electronic interface allowing an exchange of data (including information contained in the application forms described in subsection (b)) that allows a determination of eligibility for all such programs based on a single application. Such interface shall be compatible with the method established for data verification under section 18081(c)(4) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Data matching program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each applicable State health subsidy program shall participate in a data matching arrangement for determining eligibility for participation in the program under paragraph (3) that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides access to data described in paragraph (3);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) applies only to individuals who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) receive assistance from an applicable State health subsidy program; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) apply for such assistance&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) by filing a form described in subsection (b); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) by requesting a determination of eligibility and authorizing disclosure of the information described in paragraph (3) to applicable State health coverage subsidy programs for purposes of determining and establishing eligibility; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) consistent&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18083_2_target" name="18083_2">2</a></sup> with standards promulgated by the Secretary, including the privacy and data security safeguards described in section 1942 of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1396w&ndash;2] or that are otherwise applicable to such programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Determination of eligibility</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Each applicable State health subsidy program shall, to the maximum extent practicable&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) establish, verify, and update eligibility for participation in the program using the data matching arrangement under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) determine such eligibility on the basis of reliable, third party data, including information described in sections 1137, 453(i), and 1942(a) of the Social Security Act [42 U.S.C. 1320b&ndash;7, 653(i), 1396w&ndash;2(a)], obtained through such arrangement.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall not apply in circumstances with respect to which the Secretary determines that the administrative and other costs of use of the data matching arrangement under paragraph (2) outweigh its expected gains in accuracy, efficiency, and program participation.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Secretarial standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall, after consultation with persons in possession of the data to be matched and representatives of applicable State health subsidy programs, promulgate standards governing the timing, contents, and procedures for data matching described in this subsection. Such standards shall take into account administrative and other costs and the value of data matching to the establishment, verification, and updating of eligibility for applicable State health subsidy programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:8165 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administrative authority</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Agreements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to section 18081 of this title and section 6103(<em>l</em>)(21) of title 26 and any other requirement providing safeguards of privacy and data integrity, the Secretary may establish model agreements, and enter into agreements, for the sharing of data under this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Authority of exchange to contract out</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Nothing in this section shall be construed to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prohibit contractual arrangements through which a State medicaid agency determines eligibility for all applicable State health subsidy programs, but only if such agency complies with the Secretary's requirements ensuring reduced administrative costs, eligibility errors, and disruptions in coverage; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) change any requirement under title XIX&nbsp;<sup><a href="#18083_1_target" name="18083_1">1</a></sup> that eligibility for participation in a State's medicaid program must be determined by a public agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Applicable State health subsidy program</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;18091. Requirement to maintain minimum essential coverage; findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The individual responsibility requirement provided for in this section (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;requirement&rdquo;) is commercial and economic in nature, and substantially affects interstate commerce, as a result of the effects described in paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Effects on the national economy and interstate commerce</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The effects described in this paragraph are the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The requirement regulates activity that is commercial and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions about how and when health care is paid for, and when health insurance is purchased. In the absence of the requirement, some individuals would make an economic and financial decision to forego health insurance coverage and attempt to self-insure, which increases financial risks to households and medical providers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) Health insurance and health care services are a significant part of the national economy. National health spending is projected to increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or 17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in 2019. Private health insurance spending is projected to be $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. Since most health insurance is sold by national or regional health insurance companies, health insurance is sold in interstate commerce and claims payments flow through interstate commerce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will add mil<!-- PDFPage:8166 -->lions of new consumers to the health insurance market, increasing the supply of, and demand for, health care services, and will increase the number and share of Americans who are insured.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by building upon and strengthening the private employer-based health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar requirement has strengthened private employer-based coverage: despite the economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-based coverage has actually increased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The economy loses up to $207,000,000,000 a year because of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the uninsured. By significantly reducing the number of the uninsured, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce this economic cost.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) The cost of providing uncompensated care to the uninsured was $43,000,000,000 in 2008. To pay for this cost, health care providers pass on the cost to private insurers, which pass on the cost to families. This cost-shifting increases family premiums by on average over $1,000 a year. By significantly reducing the number of the uninsured, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will lower health insurance premiums.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused in part by medical expenses. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will improve financial security for families.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government has a significant role in regulating health insurance. The requirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of economic activity, and the absence of the requirement would undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health Service Act [42 U.S.C. 300gg&ndash;3, 300gg&ndash;4] (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there were no requirement, many individuals would wait to purchase health insurance until they needed care. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating effective health insurance markets in which improved health insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) Administrative costs for private health insurance, which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of premiums in the current individual and small group markets. By significantly increasing health insurance coverage and the size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating effective health insurance markets that do not require underwriting and eliminate its associated administrative costs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Supreme Court ruling</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In United States v. South-Eastern Underwriters Association (322 U.S. 533 (1944)), the Supreme Court of the United States ruled that insurance is interstate commerce subject to Federal regulation.</p>
