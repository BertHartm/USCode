<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this program is to enable States to develop and establish, or expand, and to operate coordinated programs of community-based family support services, family preservation services, time-limited family reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services to accomplish the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To prevent child maltreatment among families at risk through the provision of supportive family services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To assure children's safety within the home and preserve intact families in which children have been maltreated, when the family's problems can be addressed effectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To address the problems of families whose children have been placed in foster care so that reunification may occur in a safe and stable manner in accordance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To support adoptive families by providing support services as necessary so that they can make a lifetime commitment to their children.</p>
