In making such a determination, the Secretary shall take into consideration the findings of the study under section 501(b) of the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 (relating to the relationship between epidemiological measures and health care for certain individuals with HIV disease).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Effect of adverse determination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">If under clause (i) the Secretary determines that data on cases of HIV disease is not sufficiently accurate and reliable for use for purposes of subparagraph (C)(i), then notwithstanding such subparagraph, for any fiscal year prior to fiscal year 2007 the references in such subparagraph to cases of HIV disease do not have any legal effect.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Grants and technical assistance regarding counting of HIV cases</h4>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Unexpended funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary may, in determining the amount of a grant for a fiscal year under this paragraph, adjust the grant amount to reflect the amount of unexpended and uncanceled grant funds remaining at the end of the fiscal year preceding the year for which the grant determination is to be made. The amount of any such unexpended funds shall be determined using the financial status report of the grantee.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Increases in grant</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For each fiscal year in a protection period for an eligible area, the Secretary shall increase the amount of the grant made pursuant to paragraph (2) for the area to ensure that&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">If for fiscal year 2005, pursuant to paragraph (3)(D)(ii), data on cases of HIV disease are used for purposes of paragraph (3)(C)(i), the Secretary shall increase the amount of a grant made pursuant to paragraph (2) for an eligible area to ensure that the grant is not less than 98 percent of the amount of the grant made for the area in fiscal year 2004.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Base year; protection period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to grants made pursuant to paragraph (2) for an eligible area:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) The base year for a protection period is the fiscal year preceding the trigger grant-reduction year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) The first trigger grant-reduction year is the first fiscal year (after fiscal year 2000) for which the grant for the area is less than the grant for the area for the preceding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) A protection period begins with the trigger grant-reduction year and continues until the beginning of the first fiscal year for which the amount of the grant determined pursuant to paragraph (2) for the area equals or exceeds the amount of the grant determined under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Any subsequent trigger grant-reduction year is the first fiscal year, after the end of the preceding protection period, for which the amount of the grant is less than the amount of the grant for the preceding fiscal year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) contains a report concerning the dissemination of emergency relief funds under subsection (a) of this section and the plan for utilization of such funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) demonstrates the severe need in such area for supplemental financial assistance to combat the HIV epidemic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) demonstrates the existing commitment of local resources of the area, both financial and in-kind, to combating the HIV epidemic;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) demonstrates the ability of the area to utilize such supplemental financial resources in a manner that is immediately responsive and cost effective;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) demonstrates the inclusiveness of the planning council membership, with particular emphasis on affected communities and individuals with HIV disease; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) demonstrates the manner in which the proposed services are consistent with the local needs assessment and the statewide coordinated statement of need.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of grant</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of each grant made for purposes of this subsection shall be determined by the Secretary based on a weighting of factors under paragraph (1), with severe need under subparagraph (B) of such paragraph counting one-third.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Severe need</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining severe need in accordance with paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary shall consider the ability of the qualified applicant to expend funds efficiently and the impact of relevant factors on the cost and complexity of delivering health care and support services to individuals with HIV disease in the eligible area, including factors such as&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) sexually transmitted diseases, substance abuse, tuberculosis, severe mental illness, or other comorbid factors determined relevant by the Secretary;</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Prevalence</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the impact of the factors described in subparagraph (B), the Secretary shall, to the extent practicable, use national, quantitative incidence data that are available for each eligible area. Not later than 18 months after October 20, 2000, the Secretary shall develop a mechanism to utilize such data. Such a mechanism shall be modified to reflect the findings of the study under section 501(b) of the Ryan White CARE Act Amendments of 2000 (relating to the relationship between epidemiological measures and health care for certain individuals with HIV disease). In the absence of such data, the Secretary may consider a detailed description and qualitative analysis of severe need, as determined under subparagraph (B), including any local prevalence data gathered and analyzed by the eligible area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subsequent to the development of the quantitative mechanism described in subparagraph (C), the Secretary shall phase in, over a 3-year period beginning in fiscal year 1998, the use of such a mechanism to determine the severe need of an eligible area compared to other eligible areas and to determine, in part, the amount of supplemental funds awarded to the eligible area under this part.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Remainder of amounts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the amount of funds to be obligated under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include amounts that are not paid to the eligible areas under expedited procedures under subsection (a)(2) of this section as a result of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the failure of any eligible area to submit an application under section 300ff&ndash;15(c)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#300ff-13_2_target" name="300ff-13_2">2</a></sup> of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any eligible area informing the Secretary that such eligible area does not intend to expend the full amount of its grant under such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Failure to submit</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The failure of an eligible area to submit an application for an expedited grant under subsection (a)(2) of this section shall not result in such area being ineligible for a grant under this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The application of an eligible area submitted under section 300ff&ndash;15(b) of this title shall contain the assurances required under subsection (a) of such section if such eligible area fails to submit an application for an expedited grant under subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Compliance with priorities of HIV planning council</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, the Secretary, in carrying out section 300ff&ndash;11(a) of this title, may not make any grant under subsection (a) or (b) of this section to an eligible area unless the application submitted by such area under section 300ff&ndash;15 of this title for the grant involved demonstrates that the grants made under subsections (a) and (b) of this section to the area for the preceding fiscal year (if any) were expended in accordance with the priorities applicable to such year that were established, pursuant to section 300ff&ndash;12(b)(4)(C) of this title, by the planning council serving the area.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Research studies and statewide clinical experiences have demonstrated that administration of anti-retroviral medication during pregnancy can significantly reduce the transmission of the human im<!-- PDFPage:1096 -->munodeficiency virus (commonly known as HIV) from an infected mother to her baby.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended that all pregnant women receive HIV counseling; voluntary, confidential HIV testing; and appropriate medical treatment (including anti-retroviral therapy) and support services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The provision of such testing without access to such counseling, treatment, and services will not improve the health of the woman or the child.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The provision of such counseling, testing, treatment, and services can reduce the number of pediatric cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome, can improve access to and provision of medical care for the woman, and can provide opportunities for counseling to reduce transmission among adults, and from mother to child.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The provision of such counseling, testing, treatment, and services can reduce the overall cost of pediatric cases of acquired immune deficiency syndrome.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The cancellation or limitation of health insurance or other health coverage on the basis of HIV status should be impermissible under applicable law.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of States whose laws or regulations are in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the Secretary, subject to subsection (c)(2) of this section, may make grants to the States for carrying out programs to provide partner counseling and referral services.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Description of compliant State programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of subsection (a) of this section, the laws or regulations of a State are in accordance with this subsection if under such laws or regulations (including programs carried out pursuant to the discretion of State officials) the following policies are in effect:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The State requires that the public health officer of the State carry out a program of partner notification to inform partners of individuals with HIV disease that the partners may have been exposed to the disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) In the case of a health entity that provides for the performance on an individual of a test for HIV disease, or that treats the individual for the disease, the State requires, subject to subparagraph (B), that the entity confidentially report the positive test results to the State public health officer in a manner recommended and approved by the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, together with such additional information as may be necessary for carrying out such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The State may provide that the requirement of subparagraph (A) does not apply to the testing of an individual for HIV disease if the individual underwent the testing through a program designed to perform the test and provide the results to the individual without the individual disclosing his or her identity to the program. This subparagraph may not be construed as affecting the requirement of subparagraph (A) with respect to a health entity that treats an individual for HIV disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The program under paragraph (1) is carried out in accordance with the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Partners are provided with an appropriate opportunity to learn that the partners have been exposed to HIV disease, subject to subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The State does not inform partners of the identity of the infected individuals involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Counseling and testing for HIV disease are made available to the partners and to infected individuals, and such counseling includes information on modes of transmission for the disease, including information on prenatal and perinatal transmission and preventing transmission.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Counseling of infected individuals and their partners includes the provision of information regarding therapeutic measures for preventing and treating the deterioration of the immune system and conditions arising from the disease, and the provision of other prevention-related information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Referrals for appropriate services are provided to partners and infected individuals, including referrals for support services and legal aid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Notifications under subparagraph (A) are provided in person, unless doing so is an unreasonable burden on the State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) There is no criminal or civil penalty on, or civil liability for, an infected individual if the individual chooses not to identify the partners of the individual, or the individual does not otherwise cooperate with such program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) The failure of the State to notify partners is not a basis for the civil liability of any health entity who under the program reported to the State the identity of the infected individual involved.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1098 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) The State provides that the provisions of the program may not be construed as prohibiting the State from providing a notification under subparagraph (A) without the consent of the infected individual involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The State annually reports to the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the number of individuals from whom the names of partners have been sought under the program under paragraph (1), the number of such individuals who provided the names of partners, and the number of partners so named who were notified under the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The State cooperates with such Director in carrying out a national program of partner notification, including the sharing of information between the public health officers of the States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reporting system for cases of HIV disease; preference in making grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In making grants under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall give preference to States whose reporting systems for cases of HIV disease produce data on such cases that is sufficiently accurate and reliable for use for purposes of section 300ff&ndash;28(a)(2)(D)(i) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of carrying out this section, there are authorized to be appropriated $30,000,000 for fiscal year 2001, and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2002 through 2005.</p>
