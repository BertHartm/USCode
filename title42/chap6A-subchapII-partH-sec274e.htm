<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;valuable consideration&rdquo; does not include the reasonable payments associated with the removal, transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, and storage of a human organ or the expenses of travel, housing, and lost wages incurred by the donor of a human organ in connection with the donation of the organ.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;interstate commerce&rdquo; has the meaning prescribed for it by section 321(b) of title 21.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) A second individual (referred to in this paragraph as the &ldquo;second donor&rdquo;) desires to make a living donation of a human organ specifically to a second particular patient (referred to in this paragraph as the &ldquo;second patient&rdquo;), but such donor is biologically incompatible as a donor for such patient.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) If there is any additional donor-patient pair as described in subparagraph (A) or (B), each donor in the group of donor-patient pairs is biologically compatible as a donor of a human organ for a patient in such group.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) All donors and patients in the group of donor-patient pairs (whether 2 pairs or more than 2 pairs) enter into a single agreement to donate and receive such human organs, respectively, according to such biological compatibility in the group.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) Other than as described in subparagraph (E), no valuable consideration is knowingly acquired, received, or otherwise transferred with respect to the human organs referred to in such subparagraph.</p>
