<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Plan approval</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may approve any plan developed by a State or local government, for the establishment of a prototype residential energy efficiency program, which is designed to demonstrate the feasibility, economics, and energy conserving potential of such program, if an application for such plan is submitted pursuant to section 8235b of this title, the application is approved pursuant to section 8235c of this title, and the plan provides for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the entering into a contract by a public utility with one or more persons not under the control of, and not affiliates or subsidiaries of, such utility for the implementation of a program to encourage energy conservation, including the supply and installation of the energy conservation measures as specified in such contract in residential buildings located in the portion of the utility's service area designated by the contract, which contract includes the provisions described in subsection (b) of this section;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the savings in energy costs that are likely to result from the installation of such energy conservation measures;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) suggestions (including suggestions developed by the Secretary) of energy conservation techniques, including adjustments in energy use patterns and modifications in household activities, which can be used by the owner or occupant of the building to save energy and which do not require the installation of energy conservation measures; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the savings in energy costs that are likely to result from the adoption of such suggested energy conservation techniques;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the supply and installation, with the approval of the owner of the residential building, in such building in a timely manner of the energy conservation measures which are as specified in the contract and which the owner or occupant was informed (pursuant to the inspection under paragraph (1)) would be supplied and installed in such building; and</p>
