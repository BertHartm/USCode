<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Submission of policy by insurer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall establish a procedure whereby medicare supplemental policies (as defined in subsection (g)(1) of this section) may be certified by the Secretary as meeting minimum standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Such procedure shall provide an opportunity for any insurer to submit any such policy, and such additional data as the Secretary finds necessary, to the Secretary for his examination and for his certification thereof as meeting the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Subject to subsections (k)(3), (m), and (n) of this section, such certification shall remain in effect if the insurer files a notarized statement with the Secretary no later than June 30 of each year stating that the policy continues to meet such standards and requirements and if the insurer submits such additional data as the Secretary finds necessary to independently verify the accuracy of such notarized statement. Where the Secretary determines such a policy meets (or continues to meet) such standards and requirements, he shall authorize the insurer to have printed on such policy (but only in accordance with such requirements and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe) an emblem which the Secretary shall cause to be designed for use as an indication that a policy has received the Secretary's certification. The Secretary shall provide each State commissioner or superintendent of insurance with a list of all the policies which have received his certification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) No medicare supplemental policy may be issued in a State on or after the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the State's regulatory program under subsection (b)(1) of this section provides for the application and enforcement of the standards and requirements set forth in such subsection (including the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation (as the case may be)) by the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) if the State's program does not provide for the application and enforcement of such standards and requirements, the policy has been certified by the Secretary under paragraph (1) as meeting the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section (including such applicable standards) by such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any person who issues a medicare supplemental policy, on and after the effective date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section, in violation of this paragraph is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Standards and requirements; periodic review by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Any medicare supplemental policy issued in any State which the Secretary determines has established under State law a regulatory program that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) provides for the application and enforcement of standards with respect to such policies equal to or more stringent than the NAIC Model Standards (as defined in subsection (g)(2)(A) of this section), except as otherwise provided by subparagraph (H);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) includes requirements equal to or more stringent than the requirements described in paragraphs (2) through (5) of subsection (c) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provides that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) information with respect to the actual ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected under such policies will be reported to the State on forms conforming to those developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners for such purpose, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) such ratios will be monitored under the program in an alternative manner approved by the Secretary, and that a copy of each such policy, the most recent premium for each such policy, and a listing of the ratio of benefits provided to premiums collected for the most recent 3-year period for each such policy issued or sold in the State is maintained and made available to interested persons;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) provides for application and enforcement of the standards and requirements described in subparagraphs (A), (B), and (C) to all medicare supplemental policies (as defined in subsection (g)(1) of this section) issued in such State,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) provides the Secretary periodically (but at least annually) with a list containing the name and address of the issuer of each such policy and the name and number of each such policy (including an indication of policies that have been previously approved, newly approved, or withdrawn from approval since the previous list was provided),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) reports to the Secretary on the implementation and enforcement of standards and requirements of this paragraph at intervals established by the Secretary,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) provides for a process for approving or disapproving proposed premium increases with respect to such policies, and establishes a policy for the holding of public hearings prior to approval of a premium increase, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) in the case of a policy that meets the standards under subparagraph (A) except that benefits under the policy are limited to items <!-- PDFPage:1871 -->and services furnished by certain entities (or reduced benefits are provided when items or services are furnished by other entities), provides for the application of requirements equal to or more stringent than the requirements under subsection (t) of this section,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be deemed (subject to subsections (k)(3), (m), and (n) of this section, for so long as the Secretary finds that such State regulatory program continues to meet the standards and requirements of this paragraph) to meet the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section. Each report required under subparagraph (F) shall include information on loss ratios of policies sold in the State, frequency and types of instances in which policies approved by the State fail to meet the standards and requirements of this paragraph, actions taken by the State to bring such policies into compliance, information regarding State programs implementing consumer protection provisions, and such further information as the Secretary in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners may specify.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary periodically shall review State regulatory programs to determine if they continue to meet the standards and requirements specified in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that a State regulatory program no longer meets the standards and requirements, before making a final determination, the Secretary shall provide the State an opportunity to adopt such a plan of correction as would permit the State regulatory program to continue to meet such standards and requirements. If the Secretary makes a final determination that the State regulatory program, after such an opportunity, fails to meet such standards and requirements, the program shall no longer be considered to have in operation a program meeting such standards and requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), a medicare supplemental policy offered in a State shall not be deemed to meet the standards and requirements set forth in subsection (c) of this section, with respect to an advertisement (whether through written, radio, or television medium) used (or, at a State's option, to be used) for the policy in the State, unless the entity issuing the policy provides a copy of each advertisement to the Commissioner of Insurance (or comparable officer identified by the Secretary) of that State for review or approval to the extent it may be required under State law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requisite findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall certify under this section any medicare supplemental policy, or continue certification of such a policy, only if he finds that such policy (or, with respect to paragraph (3) or the requirement described in subsection (s) of this section, the issuer of the policy)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) meets or exceeds (either in a single policy or, in the case of nonprofit hospital and medical service associations, in one or more policies issued in conjunction with one another) the NAIC Model Standards (except as otherwise provided by subsection (t) of this section);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) meets the requirements of subsection (r) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) accepts a notice under section 1395u(h)(3)(B) of this title as a claim form for benefits under such policy in lieu of any claim form otherwise required and agrees to make a payment determination on the basis of the information contained in such notice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) where such a notice is received&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) provides notice to such physician or supplier and the beneficiary of the payment determination under the policy, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) provides any payment covered by such policy directly to the participating physician or supplier involved;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provides each enrollee at the time of enrollment a card listing the policy name and number and a single mailing address to which notices under section 1395u(h)(3)(B) of this title respecting the policy are to be sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) agrees to pay any user fees established under section 1395u(h)(3)(B) of this title with respect to information transmitted to the issuer of the policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) provides to the Secretary at least annually, for transmittal to carriers, a single mailing address to which notices under section 1395u(h)(3)(B) of this title respecting the policy are to be sent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may, during a period of not less than 30 days after the policy is issued, be returned for a full refund of any premiums paid (without regard to the manner in which the purchase of the policy was solicited); and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary shall, in consultation with Federal and State regulatory agencies, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, private insurers, and organizations representing consumers and the aged, conduct a comprehensive study and evaluation of the comparative effectiveness of various State ap<!-- PDFPage:1874 -->proaches to the regulation of medicare supplemental policies in (i) limiting marketing and agent abuse, (ii) assuring the dissemination of such information to individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter (and to other consumers) as is necessary to permit informed choice, (iii) promoting policies which provide reasonable economic benefits for such individuals, (iv) reducing the purchase of unnecessary duplicative coverage, (v) improving price competition, and (vi) establishing effective approved State regulatory programs described in subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(q) Guaranteed renewal of policies; termination; suspension</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The requirements of this subsection are as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Each medicare supplemental policy shall be guaranteed renewable and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the issuer may not cancel or nonrenew the policy solely on the ground of health status of the individual; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuer shall not cancel or nonrenew the policy for any reason other than nonpayment of premium or material misrepresentation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the medicare supplemental policy is terminated by the group policyholder and is not replaced as provided under paragraph (4), the issuer shall offer certificateholders an individual medicare supplemental policy which (at the option of the certificateholder)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provides for continuation of the benefits contained in the group policy, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) provides for such benefits as otherwise meets&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395ss_4_target" name="1395ss_4">4</a></sup> the requirements of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If an individual is a certificateholder in a group medicare supplemental policy and the individual terminates membership in the group, the issuer shall&mdash;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:1880 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) at the option of the group policyholder, offer the certificateholder continuation of coverage under the group policy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If a group medicare supplemental policy is replaced by another group medicare supplemental policy purchased by the same policyholder, issuer&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395ss_5_target" name="1395ss_5">5</a></sup> of the replacement policy shall offer coverage to all persons covered under the old group policy on its date of termination. Coverage under the new group policy shall not result in any exclusion for preexisting conditions that would have been covered under the group policy being replaced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5)(A) Each medicare supplemental policy shall provide that benefits and premiums under the policy shall be suspended at the request of the policyholder for the period (not to exceed 24 months) in which the policyholder has applied for and is determined to be entitled to medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, but only if the policyholder notifies the issuer of such policy within 90 days after the date the individual becomes entitled to such assistance. If such suspension occurs and if the policyholder or certificate holder loses entitlement to such medical assistance, such policy shall be automatically reinstituted (effective as of the date of termination of such entitlement) under terms described in subsection (n)(6)(A)(ii) of this section as of the termination of such entitlement if the policyholder provides notice of loss of such entitlement within 90 days after the date of such loss.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Nothing in this section shall be construed as affecting the authority of a State, under subchapter XIX of this chapter, to purchase a medicare supplemental policy for an individual otherwise entitled to assistance under such subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Any person who issues a medicare supplemental policy and fails to comply with the requirements of this paragraph is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(r) Required ratio of aggregate benefits to aggregate premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A medicare supplemental policy may not be issued or renewed (or otherwise provide coverage after the date described in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section) in any State unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the policy can be expected for periods after the effective date of these provisions (as estimated for the entire period for which rates are computed to provide coverage, on the basis of incurred claims experience and earned premiums for such periods and in accordance with a uniform methodology, including uniform reporting standards, developed by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners) to return to policyholders in the form of aggregate benefits provided under the policy, at least 75 percent of the aggregate amount of premiums collected in the case of group policies and at least 65 percent in the case of individual policies; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the issuer of the policy provides for the issuance of a proportional refund, or a credit against future premiums of a proportional amount, based on the premium paid and in accordance with paragraph (2), of the amount of premiums received necessary to assure that the ratio of aggregate benefits provided to the aggregate premiums collected (net of such refunds or credits) complies with the expectation required under subparagraph (A), treating policies of the same type as a single policy for each standard package.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">For purposes of applying subparagraph (A) only, policies issued as a result of solicitations of individuals through the mails or by mass media advertising (including both print and broadcast advertising) shall be deemed to be individual policies. For the purpose of calculating the refund or credit required under paragraph (1)(B) for a policy issued before the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section, the refund or credit calculation shall be based on the aggregate benefits provided and premiums collected under all such policies issued by an insurer in a State (separated as to individual and group policies) and shall be based only on aggregate benefits provided and premiums collected under such policies after the date specified in section 171(m)(4) of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Paragraph (1)(B) shall be applied with respect to each type of policy by standard package. Paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply to a policy until 12 months following issue. The Comptroller General, in consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, shall submit to Congress a report containing recommendations on adjustment in the percentages under paragraph (1)(A) that may be appropriate. In the case of a policy issued before the date specified in subsection (p)(1)(C) of this section, paragraph (1)(B) shall not apply until 1 year after the date specified in section 171(m)(4) of the Social Security Act Amendments of 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A refund or credit required under paragraph (1)(B) shall be made to each policyholder insured under the applicable policy as of the last day of the year involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Such a refund or credit shall include interest from the end of the calendar year involved until the date of the refund or credit at a rate as specified by the Secretary for this purpose from time to time which is not less than the average rate of interest for 13-week Treasury notes.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph and paragraph (1)(B), refunds or credits against premiums due shall be made, with respect to a calendar year, not later than the third quarter of the succeeding calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of this subsection do not preempt a State from requiring a higher percentage than that specified in paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary shall submit in October of each year (beginning with 1993) a report to the Committees on Energy and Commerce and Ways <!-- PDFPage:1881 -->and Means of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate on loss ratios under medicare supplemental policies and the use of sanctions, such as a required rebate or credit or the disallowance of premium increases, for policies that fail to meet the requirements of this subsection (relating to loss ratios). Such report shall include a list of the policies that failed to comply with such loss ratio requirements or other requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) The Comptroller General shall periodically, not less often than once every 3 years, perform audits with respect to the compliance of medicare supplemental policies with the loss ratio requirements of this subsection and shall report the results of such audits to the State involved and to the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary may independently perform such compliance audits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) A person who fails to provide refunds or credits as required in paragraph (1)(B) is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $25,000 for each policy issued for which such failure occurred. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each issuer of a policy subject to the requirements of paragraph (1)(B) shall be liable to the policyholder or, in the case of a group policy, to the certificate holder for credits required under such paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(s) Coverage for pre-existing conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a medicare supplemental policy replaces another medicare supplemental policy, the issuer of the replacing policy shall waive any time periods applicable to preexisting conditions, waiting period, elimination periods and probationary periods in the new medicare supplemental policy for similar benefits to the extent such time was spent under the original policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The issuer of a medicare supplemental policy may not deny or condition the issuance or effectiveness of a medicare supplemental policy, or discriminate in the pricing of the policy, because of health status, claims experience, receipt of health care, or medical condition in the case of an individual for whom an application is submitted prior to or during the 6 month period beginning with the first month as of the first day on which the individual is 65 years of age or older and is enrolled for benefits under part B of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to subparagraph (C), subparagraph (A) shall not be construed as preventing the exclusion of benefits under a policy, during its first 6 months, based on a pre-existing condition for which the policyholder received treatment or was otherwise diagnosed during the 6 months before the policy became effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If a medicare supplemental policy or certificate replaces another such policy or certificate which has been in effect for 6 months or longer, the replacing policy may not provide any time period applicable to pre-existing conditions, waiting periods, elimination periods, and probationary periods in the new policy or certificate for similar benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any issuer of a medicare supplemental policy that fails to meet the requirements of paragraphs (1) and (2) is subject to a civil money penalty of not to exceed $5,000 for each such failure. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(t) Medicare select policies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If a medicare supplemental policy meets the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation and otherwise complies with the requirements of this section except that benefits under the policy are restricted to items and services furnished by certain entities (or reduced benefits are provided when items or services are furnished by other entities), the policy shall nevertheless be treated as meeting those standards if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) full benefits are provided for items and services furnished through a network of entities which have entered into contracts or agreements with the issuer of the policy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) full benefits are provided for items and services furnished by other entities if the services are medically necessary and immediately required because of an unforeseen illness, injury, or condition and it is not reasonable given the circumstances to obtain the services through the network;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the network offers sufficient access;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the issuer of the policy has arrangements for an ongoing quality assurance program for items and services furnished through the network;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E)(i) the issuer of the policy provides to each enrollee at the time of enrollment an explanation of (I) the restrictions on payment under the policy for services furnished other than by or through the network, (II) out of area coverage under the policy, (III) the policy's coverage of emergency services and urgently needed care, and (IV) the availability of a policy through the entity that meets the standards in the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation without reference to this subsection and the premium charged for such policy, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) each enrollee prior to enrollment acknowledges receipt of the explanation provided under clause (i); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the issuer of the policy makes available to individuals, in addition to the policy described in this subsection, any policy (otherwise offered by the issuer to individuals in the State) that meets the standards in the 1991 NAIC Model Regulation or 1991 Federal Regulation and other requirements of this section without reference to this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the Secretary determines that an issuer of a policy approved under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) fails substantially to provide medically necessary items and services to enrollees seeking such items and services through the issuer's network, if the failure has adversely affected (or has substantial likelihood of adversely affecting) the individual,</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1882 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) imposes premiums on enrollees in excess of the premiums approved by the State,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) acts to expel an enrollee for reasons other than nonpayment of premiums, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) does not provide the explanation required under paragraph (1)(E)(i) or does not obtain the acknowledgment required under paragraph (1)(E)(ii),</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the issuer is subject to a civil money penalty in an amount not to exceed $25,000 for each such violation. The provisions of section 1320a&ndash;7a of this title (other than the first sentence of subsection (a) and other than subsection (b)) shall apply to a civil money penalty under the previous sentence in the same manner as such provisions apply to a penalty or proceeding under section 1320a&ndash;7a(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary may enter into a contract with an entity whose policy has been certified under paragraph (1) or has been approved by a State under subsection (b)(1)(H) of this section to determine whether items and services (furnished to individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter and under that policy) are not allowable under section 1395y(a)(1) of this title. Payments to the entity shall be in such amounts as the Secretary may determine, taking into account estimated savings under contracts with carriers and fiscal intermediaries and other factors that the Secretary finds appropriate. Paragraph (1), the first sentence of paragraph (2)(A), paragraph (2)(B), paragraph (3)(C), paragraph (3)(D), and paragraph (3)(E) of section 1395u(b) of this title shall apply to the entity.</p>
