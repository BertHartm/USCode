<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of reimbursement paid to any licensee under paragraph (1) shall be determined by the Secretary in accordance with regulations issued pursuant to section 2296a&ndash;1 of this title and, for uranium mill tailings only, shall not exceed an amount equal to $6.25 multiplied by the dry short tons of byproduct material located on October 24, 1992, at the site of the activities of such licensee described in subsection (a) of this section, and generated as an incident of sales to the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) To all active site uranium licensees</h4>
