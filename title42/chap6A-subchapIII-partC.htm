<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) lupus is a serious, complex, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of particular concern to women;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) lupus affects women nine times more often than men;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) there are three main types of lupus: systemic lupus, a serious form of the disease that affects many parts of the body; discoid lupus, a form of the disease that affects mainly the skin; and drug-induced lupus caused by certain medications;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) lupus can be fatal if not detected and treated early;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the disease can simultaneously affect various areas of the body, such as the skin, joints, kidneys, and brain, and can be difficult to diagnose because the symptoms of lupus are similar to those of many other diseases;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) lupus disproportionately affects African-American women, as the prevalence of the disease among such women is three times the prevalence among white women, and an estimated 1 in 250 African-<!-- PDFPage:436 -->American women between the ages of 15 and 65 develops the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) it has been estimated that between 1,400,000 and 2,000,000 Americans have been diagnosed with the disease, and that many more have undiagnosed cases;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) current treatments for the disease can be effective, but may lead to damaging side effects;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) many victims of the disease suffer debilitating pain and fatigue, making it difficult to maintain employment and lead normal lives; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) in fiscal year 1996, the amount allocated by the National Institutes of Health for research on lupus was $33,000,000, which is less than one-half of 1 percent of the budget for such Institutes.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Identification of tests</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">With respect to each Federal agency carrying out a program that requires or recommends acute or chronic toxicological testing, such agency shall, not later than 180 days after receiving an ICCVAM test recommendation, identify and forward to the ICCVAM any relevant test method specified in a regulation or industry-wide guideline which specifically, or in practice requires, recommends, or encourages the use of an animal acute or chronic toxicological test method for which the ICCVAM test recommendation may be added or substituted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Alternatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) of this section shall promote and encourage the development and use of alternatives to animal test methods (including batteries of tests and test screens), where appropriate, for the purpose of complying with Federal statutes, regulations, guidelines, or recommendations (in each instance, and for each chemical class) if such test methods are found to be effective for generating data, in an amount and of a scientific value that is at least equivalent to the data generated from existing tests, for hazard identification, dose-response assessment, or risk assessment purposes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Test method validation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each Federal agency carrying out a program described in subsection (a) of this section shall ensure that any new or revised acute or chronic toxicity test method, including animal test methods and alternatives, is determined to be valid for its proposed use prior to requiring, recommending, or encouraging the application of such test method.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;580, &sect;2, Dec. 29, 2000, 114 Stat. 3088, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Basic research in imaging, bioengineering, computer science, informatics, and related fields is critical to improving health care but is fundamentally different from the research in molecular biology on which the current national research institutes at the National Institutes of Health (&lsquo;NIH&rsquo;) are based. To ensure the development of new techniques and <!-- PDFPage:470 -->technologies for the 21st century, these disciplines therefore require an identity and research home at the NIH that is independent of the existing institute structure.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Advances based on medical research promise new, more effective treatments for a wide variety of diseases, but the development of new, noninvasive imaging techniques for earlier detection and diagnosis of disease is essential to take full advantage of such new treatments and to promote the general improvement of health care.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The development of advanced genetic and molecular imaging techniques is necessary to continue the current rapid pace of discovery in molecular biology.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Advances in telemedicine, and teleradiology in particular, are increasingly important in the delivery of high quality, reliable medical care to rural citizens and other underserved populations. To fulfill the promise of telemedicine and related technologies fully, a structure is needed at the NIH to support basic research focused on the acquisition, transmission, processing, and optimal display of images.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A number of Federal departments and agencies support imaging and engineering research with potential medical applications, but a central coordinating body, preferably housed at the NIH, is needed to coordinate these disparate efforts and facilitate the transfer of technologies with medical applications.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Several breakthrough imaging technologies, including magnetic resonance imaging (&lsquo;MRI&rsquo;) and computed tomography (&lsquo;CT&rsquo;), have been developed primarily abroad, in large part because of the absence of a home at the NIH for basic research in imaging and related fields. The establishment of a central focus for imaging and bioengineering research at the NIH would promote both scientific advance and United States economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) At a time when a consensus exists to add significant resources to the NIH in coming years, it is appropriate to modernize the structure of the NIH to ensure that research dollars are expended more effectively and efficiently and that the fields of medical science that have contributed the most to the detection, diagnosis, and treatment of disease in recent years receive appropriate emphasis.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The establishment of a National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering at the NIH would accelerate the development of new technologies with clinical and research applications, improve coordination and efficiency at the NIH and throughout the Federal Government, reduce duplication and waste, lay the foundation for a new medical information age, promote economic development, and provide a structure to train the young researchers who will make the pathbreaking discoveries of the next century.&rdquo;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Establishment of Institute and Advisory Council</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;580, &sect;3(b)&ndash;(d), Dec. 29, 2000, 114 Stat. 3091, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Use of Existing Resources</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In providing for the establishment of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering pursuant to the amendment made by subsection (a) [enacting this subpart], the Director of the National Institutes of Health (referred to in this subsection as &lsquo;NIH&rsquo;)&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) may transfer to the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering such personnel of NIH as the Director determines to be appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) may, for quarters for such Institute, utilize such facilities of NIH as the Director determines to be appropriate; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) may obtain administrative support for the Institute from the other agencies of NIH, including the other national research institutes.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Construction of Facilities</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;None of the provisions of this Act [enacting this subpart, amending section 281 of this title, and enacting provisions set out as notes under this section and section 201 of this title] or the amendments made by the Act may be construed as authorizing the construction of facilities, or the acquisition of land, for purposes of the establishment or operation of the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering.</p>
