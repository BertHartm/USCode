<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in accordance with the Fair Housing Act, as amended (42 U.S.C. 3601 <em>et seq</em>.)

Where such facts or information indicate a possible pattern or practice of discrimination in violation of the Act, they also shall be forwarded to the Attorney General.

<h4 class="note-head">Federal Leadership of Fair Housing</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Jan. 17, 1994, 59 F.R. 8513, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">On April 11, 1968, one week after the assassination of the great civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr., the Fair Housing Act [42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.] was enacted (1) to prohibit discrimination in housing, and (2) to direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to affirmatively further fair housing in Federal housing and urban development programs. Twenty-five years later, despite a strengthening of the Fair Housing Act 5 years ago, hundreds of acts of housing discrimination occur in our Nation each day.</p>
<p class="note-body">Americans of every income level, seeking to live where they choose, feel the weight of discrimination because of the color of their skin, their race, their religion, their gender, their country of origin, or because they are disabled or have children.</p>
<p class="note-body">An increasing body of evidence indicates that barriers to fair housing are pervasive. Forty percent of all families move every 5 years. This statistic is significant given the results of a recent study, commissioned by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), which found that more than half of the African Americans and Latinos seeking to rent or buy a home are treated differently than whites with the same qualifications. Moreover, based upon Home Mortgage Disclosure Act [12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] data, the number of minority persons who are rejected when attempting to obtain loans to purchase homes is two to three times higher than it is for nonminorities in almost every metropolitan area of this country.</p>
<p class="note-body">Racial and ethnic segregation, both in the private housing market and in public and assisted housing, has been well documented. Despite legislation (the Fair Housing Act) and Executive action (Executive Order No. 11063 [42 U.S.C. 1982 note]), the divisive impact of housing segregation persists in metropolitan areas all across this country. Too many lower income and minority Americans face barriers to housing outside of central cities. Segregation in housing and schools deprives too many of our children and youth of an opportunity to enter the marketplace or work on an equal footing. For too many families, our cities are no longer the launching pads for economic self-sufficiency and upward mobility that they have been for countless immigrants and minorities since the country's birth. And many Americans who are better off abandon the cities.</p>
<p class="note-body">The resulting decline in the very heart of too many of our metropolitan areas threatens all of us: the health of our dynamic regional economies&mdash;the very lifeblood of future national economic growth and higher living standards for all of us and all of our children&mdash;is placed at risk.</p>
<p class="note-body">We can do better. We can start by making sure that our own Federal policies and programs across all of our agencies support the fair housing and equal opportunity goals to which all Americans are committed. If all of our executive agencies affirmatively further fair housing in the design of their policies and administration of their programs relating to housing and urban development, a truly nondiscriminatory housing market will be closer to achievement.</p>
<p class="note-body">By an Executive Order [Ex. Ord. No. 12892, set out above] (&ldquo;the Order&rdquo;) I am issuing today and this memorandum, I am addressing those needs. The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and, where appropriate, the Attorney General&mdash;the officials with the primary responsibility for the enforcement of Federal fair housing laws&mdash;will take the lead in developing and coordinating measures to carry out the purposes of this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body">Through this Order, I am first expanding Executive Order No. 11063 to provide protection against discrimination in programs of Federal insurance or guaranty to persons who are disabled and to families with children.</p>
<p class="note-body">Second, I am revoking the old Executive Order No. 12259 entitled &ldquo;Leadership and Coordination of Fair Housing in Federal Programs.&rdquo; The new Executive order reflects the expanded authority of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and I am directing <!-- PDFPage:4372 -->him to take stronger measures to provide leadership and coordination in affirmatively furthering fair housing in Federal programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">Third, I ask the heads of departments and agencies, including the Federal banking agencies, to cooperate with the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development in identifying ways to structure agency programs and activities to affirmatively further fair housing and to promptly negotiate memoranda of understanding with him to accomplish that goal.</p>
<p class="note-body">Further, I direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to review all of HUD's programs to assure that they truly provide equal opportunity and promote economic self-sufficiency for those who are beneficiaries and recipients of those programs.</p>
<p class="note-body">I also direct the Secretary to review HUD's programs to assure that they contain the maximum incentives to affirmatively further fair housing and to eliminate barriers to free choice where they continue to exist. This review shall include Federally assisted housing, Federally insured housing and other housing and housing related programs, including those of the Government National Mortgage Association and the Federal Housing Administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today, I am establishing a new Cabinet-level organization to focus the cooperative efforts of all agencies on fair housing. The President's Fair Housing Council will be chaired by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and will consist of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Interior, the Chair of the Federal Reserve, the Comptroller of the Currency, the Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.</p>
<p class="note-body">The President's Fair Housing Council shall review the design and delivery of Federal programs and activities to ensure that they support a coordinated strategy to affirmatively further fair housing. The Council shall propose revisions to existing programs or activities, develop pilot programs and activities, and propose new programs and activities to achieve its goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">I direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the President's Fair Housing Council to develop a pilot program to be implemented in selected metropolitan areas. This initiative will promote fair housing choice by helping inner-city families to move to suburban neighborhoods and by making the central city more attractive to those who have left it. I direct the members of the Council to undertake a demonstration program that will reinvent the way assisted housing is offered to applicants, will break down jurisdictional barriers in housing opportunities, and will promote the use of subsidies that diminish residential segregation, and will combine these initiatives with refined educational incentives aimed at improving the effectiveness of inner-city schools. I am directing that transportation alternatives be considered along with targeted social service and job training programs as part of the support necessary to create a one-stop, metropolitan area-wide fair housing opportunity pilot program that will effectively offer Federally assisted housing, Federally insured housing, and private market housing within a metropolitan area to all residents of the area. The pilot program should call upon realtors, mortgage lenders, housing providers, and local governments, among others, to assist in expanding housing choices.</p>
<p class="note-body">To address the findings of recent studies, I hereby direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and the Attorney General and, where appropriate, the heads of the Federal banking agencies to exercise national leadership to end discrimination in mortgage lending, the secondary mortgage market, and property insurance practices. The Secretary is directed to issue regulations to define discriminatory practices in these areas and the Secretary and the Attorney General are directed to aggressively enforce the laws prohibiting these practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">In each of these areas, I direct the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to take the lead with the other Federal agencies in working to gain the voluntary cooperation, participation, and expertise of all of those in private industry, the States and localities who can assist in achieving the Nation's fair housing goals.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="presidential-signature">William J. Clinton.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Complaints and answers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A)(i) An aggrieved person may, not later than one year after an alleged discriminatory housing practice has occurred or terminated, file a complaint with the Secretary alleging such discriminatory housing practice.

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Secretary is unable to complete the investigation within 100 days after the filing of the complaint (or, when the Secretary takes further action under subsection (f)(2) of this section with respect to a complaint, within 100 days after the commencement of such further action), the Secretary shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Complaints and answers shall be under oath or affirmation, and may be reasonably and fairly amended at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A person who is not named as a respondent in a complaint, but who is identified as a respondent in the course of investigation, may be joined as an additional or substitute respondent upon written notice, under paragraph (1), to such person, from the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such notice, in addition to meeting the requirements of paragraph (1), shall explain the basis for the Secretary's belief that the person to whom the notice is addressed is properly joined as a respondent.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Investigative report and conciliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) During the period beginning with the filing of such complaint and ending with the filing of a charge or a dismissal by the Secretary, the Secretary shall, to the extent feasible, engage in conciliation with respect to such complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A conciliation agreement arising out of such conciliation shall be an agreement between the respondent and the complainant, and shall be subject to approval by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A conciliation agreement may provide for binding arbitration of the dispute arising from the complaint. Any such arbitration that results from a conciliation agreement may award appropriate relief, including monetary relief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Each conciliation agreement shall be made public unless the complainant and respondent otherwise agree and the Secretary determines that disclosure is not required to further the purposes of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) At the end of each investigation under this section, the Secretary shall prepare a final investigative report containing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the names and dates of contacts with witnesses;</p>

<!-- PDFPage:4374 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Prohibitions and requirements with respect to disclosure of information</h4>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), the Secretary shall make available to the aggrieved person and the respondent, at any time, upon request following completion of the Secretary's investigation, information derived from an investigation and any final investigative report relating to that investigation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Prompt judicial action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the Secretary concludes at any time following the filing of a complaint that prompt judicial action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this subchapter, the Secretary may authorize a civil action for appropriate temporary or preliminary relief pending final disposition of the complaint under this section. Upon receipt of such an authorization, the Attorney General shall promptly commence and maintain such an action. Any temporary restraining order or other order granting preliminary or temporary relief shall be issued in accordance with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The commencement of a civil action under this subsection does not affect the initiation or continuation of administrative proceedings under this section and section 3612 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that a basis may exist for the commencement of proceedings against any respondent under sections 3614(a) and 3614(c) of this title or for proceedings by any governmental licensing or supervisory authorities, the Secretary shall transmit the information upon which such belief is based to the Attorney General, or to such authorities, as the case may be.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Referral for State or local proceedings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Whenever a complaint alleges a discriminatory housing practice&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) within the jurisdiction of a State or local public agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as to which such agency has been certified by the Secretary under this subsection;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Secretary shall refer such complaint to that certified agency before taking any action with respect to such complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except with the consent of such certified agency, the Secretary, after that referral is made, shall take no further action with respect to such complaint unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the certified agency has failed to commence proceedings with respect to the complaint before the end of the 30th day after the date of such referral;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the certified agency, having so commenced such proceedings, fails to carry forward such proceedings with reasonable promptness; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the Secretary determines that the certified agency no longer qualifies for certification under this subsection with respect to the relevant jurisdiction.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Secretary may certify an agency under this subsection only if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the substantive rights protected by such agency in the jurisdiction with respect to which certification is to be made;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the procedures followed by such agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) the remedies available to such agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) the availability of judicial review of such agency's action;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">are substantially equivalent to those created by and under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Before making such certification, the Secretary shall take into account the current practices and past performance, if any, of such agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) During the period which begins on September 13, 1988, and ends 40 months after September 13, 1988, each agency certified (including an agency certified for interim referrals pursuant to 24 CFR 115.11, unless such agency is subsequently denied recognition under 24 CFR 115.7) for the purposes of this subchapter on the day before September 13, 1988, shall for the purposes of this subsection be considered certified under this subsection with respect to those matters for which such agency was certified on September 13, 1988. If the Secretary determines in an individual case that an agency has not been able to meet the certification requirements within this 40-month period due to exceptional circumstances, such as the infrequency of legislative sessions in that jurisdiction, the Secretary may extend such period by not more than 8 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Not less frequently than every 5 years, the Secretary shall determine whether each agency certified under this subsection continues to qualify for certification. The Secretary shall take appropriate action with respect to any agency not so qualifying.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Reasonable cause determination and effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall, within 100 days after the filing of the complaint (or, when the Secretary takes further action under subsection (f)(2) of this section with respect to a complaint, within 100 days after the commencement of such further action), determine based on the facts whether reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, unless it is impracticable to do so, or unless the Secretary has approved a conciliation agreement with respect to the complaint. If the Secretary is unable to make the determination within 100 days after the filing of the complaint (or, when the Secretary takes further action under subsection (f)(2) of this section with respect to a complaint, within 100 days after the commencement of such further action), the Secretary shall notify the complainant and respondent in writing of the reasons for not doing so.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the Secretary determines that reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the Secretary shall, except as provided in subparagraph (C), immediately issue a charge on behalf of the aggrieved person, for further proceedings under section 3612 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Such charge&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) shall consist of a short and plain statement of the facts upon which the Secretary has found reasonable cause to believe that a <!-- PDFPage:4375 -->discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) shall be based on the final investigative report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) need not be limited to the facts or grounds alleged in the complaint filed under subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the Secretary determines that the matter involves the legality of any State or local zoning or other land use law or ordinance, the Secretary shall immediately refer the matter to the Attorney General for appropriate action under section 3614 of this title, instead of issuing such charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary determines that no reasonable cause exists to believe that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the Secretary shall promptly dismiss the complaint. The Secretary shall make public disclosure of each such dismissal.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not issue a charge under this section regarding an alleged discriminatory housing practice after the beginning of the trial of a civil action commenced by the aggrieved party under an Act of Congress or a State law, seeking relief with respect to that discriminatory housing practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Service of copies of charge</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">After the Secretary issues a charge under this section, the Secretary shall cause a copy thereof, together with information as to how to make an election under section 3612(a) of this title and the effect of such an election, to be served&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on each respondent named in such charge, together with a notice of opportunity for a hearing at a time and place specified in the notice, unless that election is made; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrative law judge shall commence the hearing under this section no later than 120 days following the issuance of the charge, unless it is impracticable to do so.

Such order may, to vindicate the public interest, assess a civil penalty against the respondent&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in an amount not exceeding $10,000 if the respondent has not been adjudged to have committed any prior discriminatory housing practice;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">except that if the acts constituting the discriminatory housing practice that is the object of the charge are committed by the same natural person who has been previously adjudged to have committed acts constituting a discriminatory housing practice, then the civil penalties set forth in subparagraphs (B) and (C) may be imposed without regard to the period of time within which any subsequent discriminatory housing practice occurred.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) affirm, modify, or set aside, in whole or in part, the order, or remand the order for further proceedings; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) enforce such order to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any party to the proceeding before the administrative law judge may intervene in the court of appeals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) No objection not made before the administrative law judge shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection is excused because of extraordinary circumstances.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) which is filed by the Secretary under subsection (j) of this section after the end of such day; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) under subsection (m) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Court enforcement of administrative order upon petition of any person entitled to relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If before the expiration of 60 days after the date the administrative law judge's order is entered, no petition for review has been filed under subsection (i) of this section, and the Secretary has not sought enforcement of the order under subsection (j) of this section, any person entitled to relief under the order may petition for a decree enforcing the order in the United States court of appeals for the circuit in which the discriminatory housing practice is alleged to have occurred.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Entry of decree</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The clerk of the court of appeals in which a petition for enforcement is filed under subsection (<em>l</em>) or (m) of this section shall forthwith enter a decree enforcing the order and shall transmit a copy of such decree to the Secretary, the respondent named in the petition, and to any other parties to the proceeding before the administrative law judge.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Civil action for enforcement when election is made for such civil action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If an election is made under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall authorize, and not later than 30 days after the election is made the Attorney General shall commence and maintain, a civil action on behalf of the aggrieved person in a United States district court seeking relief under this subsection. Venue for such civil action shall be determined under chapter 87 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any aggrieved person with respect to the issues to be determined in a civil action under this subsection may intervene as of right in that civil action.</p>

Any relief so granted that would accrue to an aggrieved person in a civil action commenced by that aggrieved person under section 3613 of this title shall also accrue to that aggrieved person in a civil action under this subsection. If monetary relief is sought for the benefit of an aggrieved person who does not intervene in the civil action, the court shall not award such relief if that aggrieved person has not complied with discovery orders entered by the court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(p) Attorney's fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any administrative proceeding brought under this section, or any court proceeding arising therefrom, or any civil action under this section, the administrative law judge or the court, <!-- PDFPage:4378 -->as the case may be, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee and costs.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Civil action</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) An aggrieved person may commence a civil action in an appropriate United States district court or State court not later than 2 years after the occurrence or the termination of an alleged discriminatory housing practice, or the breach of a conciliation agreement entered into under this subchapter, whichever occurs last, to obtain appropriate relief with respect to such discriminatory housing practice or breach.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The computation of such 2-year period shall not include any time during which an administrative proceeding under this subchapter was pending with respect to a complaint or charge under this subchapter based upon such discriminatory housing practice. This subparagraph does not apply to actions arising from a breach of a conciliation agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An aggrieved person may commence a civil action under this subsection whether or not a complaint has been filed under section 3610(a) of this title and without regard to the status of any such complaint, but if the Secretary or a State or local agency has obtained a conciliation agreement with the consent of an aggrieved person, no action may be filed under this subsection by such aggrieved person with respect to the alleged discriminatory housing practice which forms the basis for such complaint except for the purpose of enforcing the terms of such an agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An aggrieved person may not commence a civil action under this subsection with respect to an alleged discriminatory housing practice which forms the basis of a charge issued by the Secretary if an administrative law judge has commenced a hearing on the record under this subchapter with respect to such charge.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Relief which may be granted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, if the court finds that a discriminatory housing practice has occurred or is about to occur, the court may award to the plaintiff actual and punitive damages, and subject to subsection (d) of this section, may grant as relief, as the court deems appropriate, any permanent or temporary injunction, temporary restraining order, or other order (including an order enjoining the defendant from engaging in such practice or ordering such affirmative action as may be appropriate).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In a civil action under subsection (a) of this section, the court, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party, other than the United States, a reasonable attorney's fee and costs.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Effect on certain sales, encumbrances, and rentals</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Intervention by Attorney General</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon timely application, the Attorney General may intervene in such civil action, if the Attorney General certifies that the case is of general public importance.

<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 905(a) of Pub. L. 102&ndash;550 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in the past half decade, there have been major legislative and administrative changes in Federal fair housing and fair lending laws and substantial improvements in the Nation's understanding of discrimination in the housing markets;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in response to evidence of continuing housing discrimination, the Congress passed the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988 [probably should be the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&ndash;430, see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note set out under section 3601 of this title], to provide for more effective enforcement of fair housing rights through judicial and administrative avenues and to expand the number of protected classes covered under Federal fair housing laws;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) in the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 [Pub. L. 101&ndash;73, see Short Title of 1989 Amendment note set out under 12 U.S.C. 1811], the Congress expanded the disclosure provisions under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act [probably should be the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975; 12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] to provide increased information on the mortgage lending patterns of financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.], the Congress provided a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) in 1991, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act disclosed evidence of pervasive discrimination in the Nation's mortgage lending markets;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Housing Discrimination Survey, released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1991, found that Hispanic and African-American homeseekers experience some form of discrimination in at least half of their encounters with sales and rental agents;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the Fair Housing Initiatives Program should be revised and expanded to reflect the significant changes in the fair housing and fair lending area that have taken place since the Program's initial authorization in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 [Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note under section 5301 of this title];</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) continuing educational efforts by the real estate industry are a useful way to increase understanding by the public of their fair housing rights and responsibilities; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the proven efficacy of private nonprofit fair housing enforcement organizations and community-based efforts makes support for these organizations a necessary component of the fair housing enforcement system.&rdquo;</p>
