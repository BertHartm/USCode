<p class="statutory-body">(2) The authority established in paragraph (1) regarding the number of members in the Silvio O. Conte Senior Biomedical Research Service is in addition to any authority established regarding the number of members in the commissioned Regular Corps, in the Reserve Corps, and in the Senior Executive Service.

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Appointments; qualifications; provisions inapplicable to members</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Service shall be appointed by the Secretary without regard to the provisions of title 5 regarding appointment, and shall consist of individuals outstanding in the field of biomedical research or clinical research evaluation. No individual may be appointed to the Service unless such individual (1) has earned a doctoral level degree in biomedicine or a related field, and (2) meets the qualification standards prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management for appointment to a position at GS&ndash;15 of the General Schedule. Notwithstanding any previous applicability to an individual who is a member of the Service, the provisions of subchapter I of chapter 35 (relating to retention preference), chapter 43 (relating to performance appraisal and performance actions), chapter 51 (relating to classification), subchapter III of chapter 53 (relating to General Schedule pay rates), and chapter 75 (relating to adverse actions) of title 5 shall not apply to any member of the Service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) retains the right to continue to make contributions to the retirement system of such institution,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">contribute an amount not to exceed 10 percent per annum of the member's basic pay to such institution's retirement system on behalf of such member.

In the case of such an individual who immediately prior to his appointment to the Service was not a career appointee in the civil service or the Senior Executive Service, such appointment shall be in the excepted civil service and may not exceed a period of 2 years.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Rules and regulations</h4>
