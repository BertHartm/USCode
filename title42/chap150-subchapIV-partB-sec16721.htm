<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Objective</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to ensure that the Nation maintains needed capabilities in fundamental areas of aeronautics research, the Administrator shall establish a program of long-term fundamental research in aeronautical sciences and technologies that is not tied to specific development projects.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Operation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall conduct the program under this section, in part by awarding grants to institutions of higher education. The Administrator shall encourage the participation of institutions of higher education located in States that participate in the Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. All grants to institutions of higher education under this section shall be awarded through merit review.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assessment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall enter into an arrangement with the National Research Council for an assessment of the Nation's future requirements for fundamental aeronautics research and whether the Nation will have a skilled research workforce and research facilities commensurate with those requirements. The assessment shall include an identification of any projected gaps, and recommendations for what steps should be taken by the Federal Government to eliminate those gaps.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall transmit the assessment, along with NASA's response to the assessment, to Congress not later than 2 years after December 30, 2005.</p>
