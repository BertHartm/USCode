<!-- PDFPage:3930 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) In the case of the offices of President and Vice President, a vote for a named candidate or a vote by writing in the name of a political party shall be counted as a vote for the electors supporting the candidate involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Restrictions on paper type, including weight and size.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Restrictions on envelope type, including weight and size.</p>
