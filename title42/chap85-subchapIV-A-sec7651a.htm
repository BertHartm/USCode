<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;baseline&rdquo; means the annual quantity of fossil fuel consumed by an affected unit, measured in millions of British Thermal Units (&ldquo;mmBtu's&rdquo;), calculated as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) For each utility unit that was in commercial operation prior to January 1, 1985, the baseline shall be the annual average quantity of mmBtu's consumed in fuel during calendar years 1985, 1986, and 1987, as recorded by the Department of Energy pursuant to Form 767. For any utility unit for which such form was not filed, the baseline shall be the level specified for such unit in the 1985 National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) Emissions Inventory, Version 2, National Utility Reference File (NURF) or in a corrected data base as established by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (3). For nonutility units, the baseline is the NAPAP Emissions Inventory, Version 2. The Administrator, in the Administrator's sole discretion, may exclude periods during which a unit is shutdown for a continuous period of four calendar months or longer, and make appropriate adjustments under this paragraph. Upon petition of the owner or operator of any unit, the Administrator may make appropriate baseline adjustments for accidents that caused prolonged outages.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) For any other nonutility unit that is not included in the NAPAP Emissions Inventory, Version 2, or a corrected data base as established by the Administrator pursuant to paragraph (3), the baseline shall be the annual average quantity, in mmBtu consumed in fuel by that unit, as calculated pursuant to a method which the administrator shall prescribe by regulation to be promulgated not later than eighteen months after November 15, 1990.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Administrator shall, upon application or on his own motion, by December 31, 1991, supplement data needed in support of this subchapter and correct any factual errors in data from which affected Phase II units&rsquo; baselines or actual 1985 emission rates have been calculated. Corrected data shall <!-- PDFPage:5659 -->be used for purposes of issuing allowances under the&nbsp;<sup><a href="#7651a_1_target" name="7651a_1">1</a></sup> subchapter.
