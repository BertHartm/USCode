<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6831. Congressional findings and purpose</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) large amounts of fuel and energy are consumed unnecessarily each year in heating, cooling, ventilating, and providing domestic hot water for newly constructed residential and commercial buildings because such buildings lack adequate energy conservation features;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Federal voluntary performance standards for newly constructed buildings can prevent such waste of energy, which the Nation can no longer afford in view of its current and anticipated energy shortage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the failure to provide adequate energy conservation measures in newly constructed buildings increases long-term operating costs that may affect adversely the repayment of, and security for, loans made, insured, or guaranteed by Federal agencies or made by federally insured or regulated instrumentalities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) State and local building codes or similar controls can provide an existing means by which to assure, in coordination with other building requirements and with a minimum of Federal interference in State and local transactions, that newly constructed buildings contain adequate energy conservation features.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The purposes of this subchapter, therefore, are to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) redirect Federal policies and practices to assure that reasonable energy conservation features will be incorporated into new commercial and residential buildings receiving Federal financial assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide for the development and implementation, as soon as practicable, of voluntary performance standards for new residential and commercial buildings which are designed to achieve the maximum practicable improvements in energy efficiency and increases in the use of nondepletable sources of energy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage States and local governments to adopt and enforce such standards through their existing building codes and other construction control mechanisms, or to apply them through a special approval process.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Each State may, to the extent consistent with otherwise applicable State law, revise the provisions of its residential building code regarding energy efficiency to meet or exceed CABO Model Energy Code, 1992, or may decline to make such revisions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If a State makes a determination under paragraph (1) that it is not appropriate for such State to revise its residential building code, such State shall submit to the Secretary, in writing, the reasons for such determination, and such statement shall be available to the public.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Whenever CABO Model Energy Code, 1992,<sup><a href="#6833_1_target" name="6833_1">1</a></sup> (or any successor of such code) is revised, the Secretary shall, not later than 12 months after such revision, determine whether such revision would improve energy efficiency in residential buildings. The Secretary shall publish notice of such determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary makes an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A), each State shall, not later than 2 years after the date of the publication of such determination, certify that it has reviewed the provisions of its residential building code regarding energy efficiency and made a determination as to whether it is appropriate for such State to revise such residential building code provisions to meet or exceed the revised code for which the Secretary made such determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Paragraphs (2), (3), and (4) shall apply to any determination made under subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Certification of commercial building energy code updates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 2 years after October 24, 1992, each State shall certify to the Secretary that it has reviewed and updated the provisions of its commercial building code regarding energy efficiency. Such certification shall include a demonstration that such State's code provisions meet or exceed the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 90.1&ndash;1989.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Whenever the provisions of ASHRAE Standard 90.1&ndash;1989 (or any successor standard) regarding energy efficiency in commercial buildings are revised, the Secretary shall, not later than 12 months after the date of such revision, determine whether such revision will improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings. The Secretary shall publish a notice of such determination in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If the Secretary makes an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A), each State shall, not later than 2 years after the date of the publication of such determination, certify that it has reviewed and updated the provisions of its commercial building code regarding energy efficiency in accordance with the revised standard for which such determination was made. Such certification shall include a demonstration that the provisions of such State's commercial building code regarding energy efficiency meet or exceed such revised standard.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Secretary makes a determination under subparagraph (A) that such revised standard will not improve energy efficiency in commercial buildings, State commercial building code provisions regarding energy efficiency shall meet or exceed ASHRAE Standard 90.1&ndash;1989, or if such standard has been revised, the last revised standard for which the Secretary has made an affirmative determination under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Extensions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall permit extensions of the deadlines for the certification requirements under subsections (a) and (b) of this section if a State can demonstrate that it has made a good faith effort to comply with such requirements and that it has made significant progress in doing so.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Technical assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall provide technical assistance to States to implement the requirements of this section, and to improve and implement State residential and commercial building energy efficiency codes or to otherwise promote the design and construction of energy efficient buildings.</p>
