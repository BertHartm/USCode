<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Satisfaction of requirement</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">A Medicare+Choice plan (other than an MSA plan) offered by a Medicare+Choice organization satisfies paragraph (1)(A), with respect to benefits for items and services furnished other than through a provider or other person that has a contract with the organization offering the plan, if the plan provides payment in an amount so that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the total dollar amount of payment for such items and services as would otherwise be authorized under parts A and B of this subchapter (including any balance billing permitted under such parts).</p>

Such benefits may include reductions in cost-sharing below the actuarial value specified in section 1395w&ndash;24(e)(4)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Organization as secondary payer</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a Medicare+Choice organization may (in the case of the provision of items and services to an individual under a Medicare+Choice plan under circumstances in which payment under this subchapter is made secondary pursuant to section 1395y(b)(2) of this title) charge or authorize the provider of such services to charge, in accordance with the charges allowed under a law, plan, or policy described in such section&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such determination or legislative change in benefits shall not apply to con<!-- PDFPage:2464 -->tracts under this part until the first contract year that begins after the end of such period, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if such coverage determination or legislative change provides for coverage of additional benefits or coverage under additional circumstances, section 1395w&ndash;21(i)(1) of this title shall not apply to payment for such additional benefits or benefits provided under such additional circumstances until the first contract year that begins after the end of such period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Limitation on cost-sharing for dual eligibles and qualified medicare beneficiaries</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payments to organizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Monthly payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under a contract under section 1395w&ndash;27 of this title and subject to subsections (e), (g), (i), and (<em>l</em>) of this section and section 1395w&ndash;28(e)(4) of this title, the Secretary shall make monthly payments under this section in advance to each Medicare+Choice organization, with respect to coverage of an individual under this part in a Medicare+Choice payment area for a month, in an amount determined as follows:</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Payment before 2006</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For years before 2006, the payment amount shall be equal to 1/12 of the annual MA capitation rate (as calculated under subsection (c)(1) of this section) with respect to that individual for that area, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and reduced by the amount of any reduction elected under section 1395w&ndash;24(f)(1)(E) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payment for original fee-for-service benefits beginning with 2006</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For years beginning with 2006, the amount specified in subparagraph (B).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Payment amount for original fee-for-service benefits beginning with 2006</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Payment of bid for plans with bids below benchmark</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a plan for which there are average per capita monthly savings described in section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(3)(C) or 1395w&ndash;24(b)(4)(C) of this title, as the case may be, the amount specified in this subparagraph is equal to the unadjusted MA statutory non-drug monthly bid amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and (if applicable) under subparagraphs (F) and (G), plus the amount (if any) of any rebate under subparagraph (E).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Payment of benchmark for plans with bids at or above benchmark</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of a plan for which there are no average per capita monthly savings described in section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(3)(C) or 1395w&ndash;24(b)(4)(C) of this title, as the case may be, the amount specified in this subparagraph is equal to the MA area-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C) and (if applicable) under subparagraphs (F) and (G).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Payment of benchmark for MSA plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Notwithstanding clauses (i) and (ii), in the case of an MSA plan, the amount spec<!-- PDFPage:2475 -->ified in this subparagraph is equal to the MA area-specific non-drug monthly benchmark amount, adjusted under subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Demographic adjustment, including adjustment for health status</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall adjust the payment amount under subparagraph (A)(i) and the amount specified under subparagraph (B)(i), (B)(ii), and (B)(iii) for such risk factors as age, disability status, gender, institutional status, and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, including adjustment for health status under paragraph (3), so as to ensure actuarial equivalence. The Secretary may add to, modify, or substitute for such adjustment factors if such changes will improve the determination of actuarial equivalence.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Application during phase-out of budget neutrality factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For 2006 through 2010:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) In applying the adjustment under clause (i) for health status to payment amounts, the Secretary shall ensure that such adjustment reflects changes in treatment and coding practices in the fee-for-service sector and reflects differences in coding patterns between Medicare Advantage plans and providers under part&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395w-23_1_target" name="1395w-23_1">1</a></sup> A and B to the extent that the Secretary has identified such differences.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) In order to ensure payment accuracy, the Secretary shall conduct an analysis of the differences described in subclause (I). The Secretary shall complete such analysis by a date necessary to ensure that the results of such analysis are incorporated into the risk scores only for 2008, 2009, and 2010. In conducting such analysis, the Secretary shall use data submitted with respect to 2004 and subsequent years, as available.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Separate payment for Federal drug subsidies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of an enrollee in an MA&ndash;PD plan, the MA organization offering such plan also receives&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) subsidies under section 1395w&ndash;115 of this title (other than under subsection (g)); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) reimbursement for premium and cost-sharing reductions for low-income individuals under section 1395w&ndash;114(c)(1)(C) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Payment of rebate for plans with bids below benchmark</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a plan for which there are average per capita monthly savings described in section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(3)(C) or 1395w&ndash;24(b)(4)(C) of this title, as the case may be, the amount specified in this subparagraph is the amount of the monthly rebate computed under section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(1)(C)(i) of this title for that plan and year (as reduced by the amount of any credit provided under section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(1)(C)(iv) of this title).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Adjustment for intra-area variations</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Intra-regional variations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of payment with respect to an MA regional plan for an MA region, the Secretary shall also adjust the amounts specified under subparagraphs (B)(i) and (B)(ii) in a manner to take into account variations in MA local payment rates under this part among the different MA local areas included in such region.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Intra-service area variations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of payment with respect to an MA local plan for a service area that covers more than one MA local area, the Secretary shall also adjust the amounts specified under subparagraphs (B)(i) and (B)(ii) in a manner to take into account variations in MA local payment rates under this part among the different MA local areas included in such service area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Adjustment relating to risk adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall adjust payments with respect to MA plans as necessary to ensure that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the monthly payment made under subparagraph (A)(ii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the MA monthly basic beneficiary premium under section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(2)(A) of this title; equals</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the unadjusted MA statutory non-drug monthly bid amount, adjusted in the manner described in subparagraph (C) and, for an MA regional plan, subparagraph (F).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Special rule for end-stage renal disease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish separate rates of payment to a Medicare+Choice organization with respect to classes of individuals determined to have end-stage renal disease and enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan of the organization. Such rates of payment shall be actuarially equivalent to rates that would have been paid with respect to other enrollees in the MA payment area (or such other area as specified by the Secretary) under the provisions of this section as in effect before December 8, 2003. In accordance with regulations, the Secretary shall provide for the application of the seventh sentence of section 1395rr(b)(7) of this title to payments under this section covering the provision of renal dialysis treatment in the same manner as such sentence applies to composite rate payments described in such sentence. In establishing such rates, the Secretary shall provide for appropriate adjustments to increase each rate to reflect the demonstration rate (including the risk adjustment methodology associated with such rate) of the social health maintenance organization end-stage renal disease capitation demonstrations (established by section 2355 of the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984, as <!-- PDFPage:2476 -->amended by section 13567(b) of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993), and shall compute such rates by taking into account such factors as renal treatment modality, age, and the underlying cause of the end-stage renal disease. The Secretary may apply the competitive bidding methodology provided for in this section, with appropriate adjustments to account for the risk adjustment methodology applied to end stage renal disease payments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to reflect number of enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of payment under this subsection may be retroactively adjusted to take into account any difference between the actual number of individuals enrolled with an organization under this part and the number of such individuals estimated to be so enrolled in determining the amount of the advance payment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for certain enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary may make retroactive adjustments under subparagraph (A) to take into account individuals enrolled during the period beginning on the date on which the individual enrolls with a Medicare+Choice organization under a plan operated, sponsored, or contributed to by the individual's employer or former employer (or the employer or former employer of the individual's spouse) and ending on the date on which the individual is enrolled in the organization under this part, except that for purposes of making such retroactive adjustments under this subparagraph, such period may not exceed 90 days.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No adjustment may be made under clause (i) with respect to any individual who does not certify that the organization provided the individual with the disclosure statement described in section 1395w&ndash;22(c) of this title at the time the individual enrolled with the organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Establishment of risk adjustment factors</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall develop, and submit to Congress by not later than March 1, 1999, a report on the method of risk adjustment of payment rates under this section, to be implemented under subparagraph (C), that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status. Such report shall include an evaluation of such method by an outside, independent actuary of the actuarial soundness of the proposal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Data collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In order to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary shall require Medicare+Choice organizations (and eligible organizations with risk-sharing contracts under section 1395mm of this title) to submit data regarding inpatient hospital services for periods beginning on or after July 1, 1997, and data regarding other services and other information as the Secretary deems necessary for periods beginning on or after July 1, 1998. The Secretary may not require an organization to submit such data before January 1, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Initial implementation</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The Secretary shall first provide for implementation of a risk adjustment methodology that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status and other demographic factors for payments by no later than January 1, 2000.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Phase-in</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Except as provided in clause (iv), such risk adjustment methodology shall be implemented in a phased-in manner so that the methodology insofar as it makes adjustments to capitation rates for health status applies to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 10 percent of 1/12 of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate in 2000 and each succeeding year through 2003;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 30 percent of such capitation rate in 2004;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) 50 percent of such capitation rate in 2005;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(IV) 75 percent of such capitation rate in 2006; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(V) 100 percent of such capitation rate in 2007 and succeeding years.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Data for risk adjustment methodology</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Such risk adjustment methodology for 2004 and each succeeding year, shall be based on data from inpatient hospital and ambulatory settings.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Full implementation of risk adjustment for congestive heart failure enrollees for 2001</h4>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(I) Exemption from phase-in</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Subject to subclause (II), the Secretary shall fully implement the risk adjustment methodology described in clause (i) with respect to each individual who has had a qualifying congestive heart failure inpatient diagnosis (as determined by the Secretary under such risk adjustment methodology) during the period beginning on July 1, 1999, and ending on June 30, 2000, and who is enrolled in a coordinated care plan that is the only coordinated care plan offered on January 1, 2001, in the service area of the individual.</p>
<h4 class="subclause-head">(II) Period of application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">Subclause (I) shall only apply during the 1-year period beginning on January 1, 2001.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Uniform application to all types of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to section 1395w&ndash;28(e)(4) of this title, the methodology shall be applied uniformly without regard to the type of plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Payment rule for federally qualified health center services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If an individual who is enrolled with an MA plan under this part receives a service from a <!-- PDFPage:2477 -->federally qualified health center that has a written agreement with the MA organization that offers such plan for providing such a service (including any agreement required under section 1395w&ndash;27(e)(3) of this title)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Secretary shall pay the amount determined under section 1395<em>l</em>(a)(3)(B) of this title directly to the federally qualified health center not less frequently than quarterly; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) <cap-smallcap>Medicare hospital expenditure proportion</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Medicare hospital expenditure proportion under this subparagraph for a year is the Secretary's estimate of the proportion, of the expenditures under parts A and B that are not attributable to this part, that are attributable to expenditures for inpatient hospital services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) <cap-smallcap>Application of payment adjustment</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In the case that a qualifying MA organization attests that not all eligible hospitals are meaningful EHR users with respect to an applicable period, the Secretary shall apply the payment adjustment under this paragraph based on a methodology specified by the Secretary, taking into account the proportion of such eligible hospitals, or discharges from such hospitals, that are not meaningful EHR users for such period.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Posting on website</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall post on the Internet website of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, in an easily understandable format&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Organized and licensed under State law</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a Medicare+Choice organization shall be organized and licensed under State law as a risk-bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each State in which it offers a Medicare+Choice plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special exception for provider-sponsored organizations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a provider-sponsored organization that seeks to offer a Medicare+Choice plan in a State, the Secretary shall waive the requirement of paragraph (1) that the organization be licensed in that State if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the organization files an application for such waiver with the Secretary by not later than November 1, 2002, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Secretary determines, based on the application and other evidence presented to the Secretary, that any of the grounds for approval of the application described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) has been met.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure to act on licensure application on a timely basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has failed to complete action on a licensing application of the organization within 90 days of the date of the State's receipt of a substantially complete application. No period before August 5, 1997, shall be included in determining such 90-day period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Denial of application based on discriminatory treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has denied such a licensing application and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the standards or review process imposed by the State as a condition of approval of the license imposes any material requirements, procedures, or standards (other than solvency requirements) to such organizations that are not generally applicable to other entities engaged in a substantially similar business, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the State requires the organization, as a condition of licensure, to offer any product or plan other than a Medicare+�Choice plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Denial of application based on application of solvency requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to waiver applications filed on or after the date of publication of solvency standards under section 1395w&ndash;26(a) of this title, the ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has denied such a licensing application based (in whole or in part) on the organization's failure to meet applicable solvency requirements and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such requirements are not the same as the solvency standards established under section 1395w&ndash;26(a) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the State has imposed as a condition of approval of the license documentation or information requirements relating to solvency or other material requirements, procedures, or standards relating to sol<!-- PDFPage:2502 -->vency that are different from the requirements, procedures, and standards applied by the Secretary under subsection (d)(2) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;solvency requirements&rdquo; means requirements relating to solvency and other matters covered under the standards established under section 1395w&ndash;26(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Treatment of waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a waiver granted under this paragraph for a provider-sponsored organization with respect to a State&mdash;</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) Limitation to State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The waiver shall be effective only with respect to that State and does not apply to any other State.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation to 36-month period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The waiver shall be effective only for a 36-month period and may not be renewed.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Conditioned on compliance with consumer protection and quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The continuation of the waiver is conditioned upon the organization's compliance with the requirements described in subparagraph (G).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Preemption of State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any provisions of law of that State which relate to the licensing of the organization and which prohibit the organization from providing coverage pursuant to a contract under this part shall be superseded.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Prompt action on application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall grant or deny such a waiver application within 60 days after the date the Secretary determines that a substantially complete waiver application has been filed. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing an organization which has had such a waiver application denied from submitting a subsequent waiver application.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Application and enforcement of State consumer protection and quality standards</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A waiver granted under this paragraph to an organization with respect to licensing under State law is conditioned upon the organization's compliance with all consumer protection and quality standards insofar as such standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) would apply in the State to the organization if it were licensed under State law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) are generally applicable to other Medicare+Choice organizations and plans in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) are consistent with the standards established under this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Such standards shall not include any standard preempted under section 1395w&ndash;26(b)(3)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Incorporation into contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of such a waiver granted to an organization with respect to a State, the Secretary shall incorporate the requirement that the organization (and Medicare+Choice plans it offers) comply with standards under clause (i) as part of the contract between the Secretary and the organization under section 1395w&ndash;27 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of such a waiver granted to an organization with respect to a State, the Secretary may enter into an agreement with the State under which the State agrees to provide for monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to compliance of such an organization and its Medicare+Choice plans with such standards. Such monitoring and enforcement shall be conducted by the State in the same manner as the State enforces such standards with respect to other Medicare+Choice organizations and plans, without discrimination based on the type of organization to which the standards apply. Such an agreement shall specify or establish mechanisms by which compliance activities are undertaken, while not lengthening the time required to review and process applications for waivers under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">By not later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate a report regarding whether the waiver process under this paragraph should be continued after December 31, 2002. In making such recommendation, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors, the impact of such process on beneficiaries and on the long-term solvency of the program under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Licensure does not substitute for or constitute certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The fact that an organization is licensed in accordance with paragraph (1) does not deem the organization to meet other requirements imposed under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assumption of full financial risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Medicare+Choice organization shall assume full financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of the health care services for which benefits are required to be provided under section 1395w&ndash;22(a)(1) of this title, except that the organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for the cost of providing to any enrolled member such services the aggregate value of which exceeds such aggregate level as the Secretary specifies from time to time,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for the cost of such services provided to its enrolled members other than through the organization because medical necessity required their provision before they could be secured through the organization,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for not more than 90 percent of <!-- PDFPage:2503 -->the amount by which its costs for any of its fiscal years exceed 115 percent of its income for such fiscal year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may make arrangements with physicians or other health care professionals, health care institutions, or any combination of such individuals or institutions to assume all or part of the financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of basic health services by the physicians or other health professionals or through the institutions.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification of provision against risk of insolvency for unlicensed PSOs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Medicare+Choice organization that is a provider-sponsored organization, that is not licensed by a State under subsection (a) of this section, and for which a waiver application has been approved under subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall meet standards established under section 1395w&ndash;26(a) of this title relating to the financial solvency and capital adequacy of the organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification process for solvency standards for PSOs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a process for the receipt and approval of applications of a provider-sponsored organization described in paragraph (1) for certification (and periodic recertification) of the organization as meeting such solvency standards. Under such process, the Secretary shall act upon such a certification application not later than 60 days after the date the application has been received.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Provider-sponsored organization&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this part, the term &ldquo;provider-sponsored organization&rdquo; means a public or private entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that is established or organized, and operated, by a health care provider, or group of affiliated health care providers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that provides a substantial proportion (as defined by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2)) of the health care items and services under the contract under this part directly through the provider or affiliated group of providers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with respect to which the affiliated providers share, directly or indirectly, substantial financial risk with respect to the provision of such items and services and have at least a majority financial interest in the entity.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">or, if greater, such proportion determined for individuals nationally.</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Use of full risk adjustment to standardize fee-for-service costs to typical beneficiary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the adjusted average per capita cost for an area and year under subparagraph (A), such costs shall be adjusted to fully take into account the demographic and health status risk factors established under section 1395w&ndash;23(a)(1)(A)(iv) of this title&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395w-29_1_target" name="1395w-29_1">1</a></sup> so that such per capita costs reflect the average costs for a typical beneficiary residing in the CCA area.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">In determining the adjusted average per capita cost under subparagraph (A) for a year, such cost shall be adjusted to include the Secretary's estimate, on a per capita basis, of the amount of additional payments that would have been made in the area involved under this subchapter if individuals entitled to benefits under this subchapter had not received services from facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs or the Department of Defense.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Premium adjustment</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Except as provided in subparagraph (B), in the case of an individual who is enrolled under part B of this subchapter, who resides in a CCA area, and who is not enrolled in an MA plan under this part, the monthly premium otherwise applied under part B of this subchapter (determined without regard to subsections (b), (f), and (i) of section 1395r of this title or any adjustment under this subsection) shall be adjusted in accordance with paragraph (2), but only in the case of premiums for months during the period in which the CCA program under this section for such area is in effect.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:2524 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) No premium adjustment for subsidy eligible beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">No premium adjustment shall be made under this subsection for a premium for a month if the individual is determined to be a subsidy eligible individual (as defined in section 1395w&ndash;114(a)(3)(A) of this title) for the month.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Amount of adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under this paragraph, subject to the exemption under paragraph (1)(B) and the limitation under subparagraph (B), if the fee-for-service area-specific non-drug amount (as defined in section&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1395w-29_2_target" name="1395w-29_2">2</a></sup> (e)(5)) for a CCA area in which an individual resides for a month&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) does not exceed the CCA non-drug monthly benchmark amount (as determined under subsection (e)(1) of this section) for such area and month, the amount of the premium for the individual for the month shall be reduced, by an amount equal to 75 percent of the amount by which such CCA benchmark exceeds such fee-for-service area-specific non-drug amount; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) exceeds such CCA non-drug benchmark, the amount of the premium for the individual for the month shall be adjusted to ensure, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the sum of the amount of the adjusted premium and the CCA non-drug benchmark for the area; is equal to</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the sum of the unadjusted premium plus the amount of such fee-for-service area-specific non-drug amount for the area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In no case shall the actual amount of an adjustment under subparagraph (A) for an area and month in a year result in an adjustment that exceeds the maximum adjustment permitted under subparagraph (C) for the area and year, or, if less, the maximum annual adjustment permitted under subparagraph (D) for the area and year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Phase-in of adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of an adjustment under subparagraph (A) for a CCA area and year may not exceed the product of the phase-in fraction for the year under subsection (d)(3)(B) of this section multiplied by the amount of the adjustment otherwise computed under subparagraph (A) for the area and year, determined without regard to this subparagraph and subparagraph (D).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) 5-percent limitation on adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of the adjustment under this subsection for months in a year shall not exceed 5 percent of the amount of the monthly premium amount determined for months in the year under section 1395r of this title without regard to subsections (b), (f), and (i) of such section and this subsection.</p>
