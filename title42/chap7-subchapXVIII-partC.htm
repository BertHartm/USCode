<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Payments to organizations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Monthly payments</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Under a contract under section 1395w&ndash;27 of this title and subject to subsections (e) and (f) of this section and section 1395w&ndash;28(e)(4) of this title, the Secretary shall make monthly payments under this section in advance to each Medicare+Choice organization, with respect to coverage of an individual under this part in a Medicare+Choice payment area for a month, in an amount equal to 1/12 of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate (as calculated under subsection (c) of this section) with respect to that individual for that area, adjusted for such risk factors as age, disability status, gender, institutional status, and such other factors as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, so as to ensure actuarial equivalence. The Secretary may add to, modify, or substitute for such factors, if such changes will improve the determination of actuarial equivalence.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for end-stage renal disease</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish separate rates of payment to a Medicare+Choice organization with respect to classes of individuals determined to have end-stage renal disease and enrolled in a Medicare+Choice plan of the organization. Such rates of payment shall be actuarially equivalent to rates paid to other enrollees in the Medicare+Choice payment area (or such other area as specified by the Secretary). In accordance with regulations, the Secretary shall provide for the application of the seventh sentence of section 1395rr(b)(7) of this title to payments under this section covering the provision of renal dialysis treatment in the same manner as such sentence applies to composite rate payments described in such sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Adjustment to reflect number of enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The amount of payment under this subsection may be retroactively adjusted to take into account any difference between the actual number of individuals enrolled with an organization under this part and the number of such individuals estimated to be so enrolled in determining the amount of the advance payment.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special rule for certain enrollees</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), the Secretary may make retroactive adjustments under subparagraph (A) to take into account individuals enrolled during the period beginning on the date on which the individual enrolls with a Medicare+Choice organization under a plan operated, sponsored, or contributed to by the individual's employer or former employer (or the employer or former employer of the individual's spouse) and ending on the date on which the individual is enrolled in the organization under this part, except that for purposes of making such retroactive adjustments under this subparagraph, such period may not exceed 90 days.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Exception</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">No adjustment may be made under clause (i) with respect to any individual who does not certify that the organization provided the individual with the disclosure statement described in section 1395w&ndash;22(c) of this title at the time the individual enrolled with the organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Establishment of risk adjustment factors</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall develop, and submit to Congress by not later than March 1, 1999, a report on the method of risk adjustment of payment rates under this section, to be implemented under subparagraph (C), that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status. Such report shall include an evaluation of such method by an outside, independent actuary of the actuarial soundness of the proposal.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Data collection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In order to carry out this paragraph, the Secretary shall require Medicare+Choice organizations (and eligible organizations with risk-sharing contracts under section 1395mm of this title) to submit data regarding inpatient hospital services for periods beginning on or after July 1, 1997, and data regarding other services and other information as the Secretary deems necessary for periods beginning on or after July 1, 1998. The Secretary may not require an organization to submit such data before January 1, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Initial implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall first provide for implementation of a risk adjustment methodology <!-- PDFPage:1914 -->that accounts for variations in per capita costs based on health status and other demographic factors for payments by no later than January 1, 2000.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Uniform application to all types of plans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to section 1395w&ndash;28(e)(4) of this title, the methodology shall be applied uniformly without regard to the type of plan.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Annual announcement of payment rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Annual announcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall annually determine, and shall announce (in a manner intended to provide notice to interested parties) not later than March 1 before the calendar year concerned&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate for each Medicare+Choice payment area for the year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the risk and other factors to be used in adjusting such rates under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section for payments for months in that year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Advance notice of methodological changes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">At least 45 days before making the announcement under paragraph (1) for a year, the Secretary shall provide for notice to Medicare+Choice organizations of proposed changes to be made in the methodology from the methodology and assumptions used in the previous announcement and shall provide such organizations an opportunity to comment on such proposed changes.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Explanation of assumptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In each announcement made under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall include an explanation of the assumptions and changes in methodology used in the announcement in sufficient detail so that Medicare+Choice organizations can compute monthly adjusted Medicare+Choice capitation rates for individuals in each Medicare+Choice payment area which is in whole or in part within the service area of such an organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Calculation of annual Medicare+Choice capitation rates</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this part, subject to paragraphs (6)(C) and (7), each annual Medicare+ï¿½Choice capitation rate, for a Medicare+Choice payment area for a contract year consisting of a calendar year, is equal to the largest of the amounts specified in the following subparagraph (A), (B), or (C):</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) Blended capitation rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the area-specific percentage (as specified under paragraph (2) for the year) of the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for the Medicare+Choice payment area, as determined under paragraph (3) for the year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the national percentage (as specified under paragraph (2) for the year) of the input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate, as determined under paragraph (4) for the year,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">multiplied by the budget neutrality adjustment factor determined under paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Minimum amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">12 multiplied by the following amount:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) For 1998, $367 (but not to exceed, in the case of an area outside the 50 States and the District of Columbia, 150 percent of the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the area).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) For a succeeding year, the minimum amount specified in this clause (or clause (i)) for the preceding year increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage, described in paragraph (6)(A) for that succeeding year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Minimum percentage increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) For 1998, 102 percent of the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the Medicare+Choice payment area.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) For a subsequent year, 102 percent of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate under this paragraph for the area for the previous year.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Area-specific and national percentages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for 1998, the &ldquo;area-specific percentage&rdquo; is 90 percent and the &ldquo;national percentage&rdquo; is 10 percent,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for 1999, the &ldquo;area-specific percentage&rdquo; is 82 percent and the &ldquo;national percentage&rdquo; is 18 percent,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) for a year after 2002, the &ldquo;area-specific percentage&rdquo; is 50 percent and the &ldquo;national percentage&rdquo; is 50 percent.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), subject to subparagraph (B), the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for 1998 is, subject to subparagraph (D), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for the area, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for 1998 (described in paragraph (6)(A)); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) for a subsequent year is the annual area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate for the previous year determined under this paragraph for the area, increased by the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for such subsequent year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1915 --><h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Removal of medical education from calculation of adjusted average per capita cost</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In determining the area-specific Medicare+Choice capitation rate under subparagraph (A) for a year (beginning with 1998), the annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title shall be adjusted to exclude from the rate the applicable percent (specified in clause (ii)) of the payment adjustments described in subparagraph (C).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Applicable percent</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">For purposes of clause (i), the applicable percent for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 1998 is 20 percent,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) 1999 is 40 percent,</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Payment adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Subject to clause (ii), the payment adjustments described in this subparagraph are payment adjustments which the Secretary estimates were payable during 1997&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for the indirect costs of medical education under section 1395ww(d)(5)(B) of this title, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for direct graduate medical education costs under section 1395ww(h) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Treatment of payments covered under State hospital reimbursement system</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">To the extent that the Secretary estimates that an annual per capita rate of payment for 1997 described in clause (i) reflects payments to hospitals reimbursed under section 1395f(b)(3) of this title, the Secretary shall estimate a payment adjustment that is comparable to the payment adjustment that would have been made under clause (i) if the hospitals had not been reimbursed under such section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Treatment of areas with highly variable payment rates</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a Medicare+Choice payment area for which the annual per capita rate of payment determined under section 1395mm(a)(1)(C) of this title for 1997 varies by more than 20 percent from such rate for 1996, for purposes of this subsection the Secretary may substitute for such rate for 1997 a rate that is more representative of the costs of the enrollees in the area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), the input-price-adjusted annual national Medicare+Choice capitation rate for a Medicare+Choice payment area for a year is equal to the sum, for all the types of medicare services (as classified by the Secretary), of the product (for each such type of service) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate (determined under subparagraph (B)) for the year,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the proportion of such rate for the year which is attributable to such type of services, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) an index that reflects (for that year and that type of services) the relative input price of such services in the area compared to the national average input price of such services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">In applying clause (iii), the Secretary may, subject to subparagraph (C), apply those indices under this subchapter that are used in applying (or updating) national payment rates for specific areas and localities.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) National standardized annual Medicare+ï¿½Choice capitation rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In subparagraph (A)(i), the &ldquo;national standardized annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate&rdquo; for a year is equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the sum (for all Medicare+Choice payment areas) of the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) the annual area-specific Medicare+ï¿½Choice capitation rate for that year for the area under paragraph (3), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) the average number of medicare beneficiaries residing in that area in the year, multiplied by the average of the risk factor weights used to adjust payments under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section for such beneficiaries in such area; divided by</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the sum of the products described in clause (i)(II) for all areas for that year.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Special rules for 1998</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In applying this paragraph for 1998&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) medicare services shall be divided into 2 types of services: part A services and part B services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the proportions described in subparagraph (A)(ii)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) for part A services shall be the ratio (expressed as a percentage) of the national average annual per capita rate of payment for part A of this subchapter for 1997 to the total national average annual per capita rate of payment for parts A and B of this subchapter for 1997, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) for part B services shall be 100 percent minus the ratio described in subclause (I);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) for part A services, 70 percent of payments attributable to such services shall be adjusted by the index used under section 1395ww(d)(3)(E) of this title to adjust payment rates for relative hospital wage levels for hospitals located in the payment area involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) for part B services&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) 66 percent of payments attributable to such services shall be adjusted by the index of the geographic area factors under section 1395w&ndash;4(e) of this title used <!-- PDFPage:1916 -->to adjust payment rates for physicians&rsquo; services furnished in the payment area, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) of the remaining 34 percent of the amount of such payments, 40 percent shall be adjusted by the index described in clause (iii); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) the index values shall be computed based only on the beneficiary population who are 65 years of age or older and who are not determined to have end stage renal disease.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">The Secretary may continue to apply the rules described in this subparagraph (or similar rules) for 1999.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Payment adjustment budget neutrality factor</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (1)(A), for each year, the Secretary shall determine a budget neutrality adjustment factor so that the aggregate of the payments under this part shall equal the aggregate payments that would have been made under this part if payment were based entirely on area-specific capitation rates.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) &ldquo;National per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In this part, the &ldquo;national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage&rdquo; for a year is the percentage determined by the Secretary, by March 1st before the beginning of the year involved, to reflect the Secretary's estimate of the projected per capita rate of growth in expenditures under this subchapter for an individual entitled to benefits under part A of this subchapter and enrolled under part B of this subchapter, reduced by the number of percentage points specified in subparagraph (B) for the year. Separate determinations may be made for aged enrollees, disabled enrollees, and enrollees with end-stage renal disease.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The number of percentage points specified in this subparagraph is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) for a year after 2002, 0 percentage points.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjustment for over or under projection of national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Beginning with rates calculated for 1999, before computing rates for a year as described in paragraph (1), the Secretary shall adjust all area-specific and national Medicare+Choice capitation rates (and beginning in 2000, the minimum amount) for the previous year for the differences between the projections of the national per capita Medicare+Choice growth percentage for that year and previous years and the current estimate of such percentage for such years.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Adjustment for national coverage determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary makes a determination with respect to coverage under this subchapter that the Secretary projects will result in a significant increase in the costs to Medicare+Choice of providing benefits under contracts under this part (for periods after any period described in section 1395w&ndash;22(a)(5) of this title), the Secretary shall adjust appropriately the payments to such organizations under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Medicare+Choice payment area&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this part, except as provided in paragraph (3), the term &ldquo;Medicare+Choice payment area&rdquo; means a county, or equivalent area specified by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Rule for ESRD beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of individuals who are determined to have end stage renal disease, the Medicare+Choice payment area shall be a State or such other payment area as the Secretary specifies.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Geographic adjustment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Upon written request of the chief executive officer of a State for a contract year (beginning after 1998) made by not later than February 1 of the previous year, the Secretary shall make a geographic adjustment to a Medicare+Choice payment area in the State otherwise determined under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) to a single statewide Medicare+Choice payment area,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to the metropolitan based system described in subparagraph (C), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to consolidating into a single Medicare+Choice payment area noncontiguous counties (or equivalent areas described in paragraph (1)) within a State.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">Such adjustment shall be effective for payments for months beginning with January of the year following the year in which the request is received.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Budget neutrality adjustment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a State requesting an adjustment under this paragraph, the Secretary shall initially (and annually thereafter) adjust the payment rates otherwise established under this section for Medicare+Choice payment areas in the State in a manner so that the aggregate of the payments under this section in the State shall not exceed the aggregate payments that would have been made under this section for Medicare+Choice payment areas in the State in the absence of the adjustment under this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) all areas in the State that do not fall within a metropolitan statistical area are treated as a single Medicare+Choice payment area.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Areas</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In subparagraph (C), the terms &ldquo;metropolitan statistical area&rdquo;, &ldquo;consolidated metropolitan statistical area&rdquo;, and &ldquo;primary metropolitan statistical area&rdquo; mean any area designated as such by the Secretary of Commerce.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Special rules for individuals electing MSA plans</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the amount of the Medicare+Choice monthly MSA premium (as defined in section 1395w&ndash;24(b)(2)(C) of this title) for an MSA plan for a year is less than 1/12 of the annual Medicare+Choice capitation rate applied under this section for the area and year involved, the Secretary shall deposit an amount equal to 100 percent of such difference in a Medicare+ï¿½Choice MSA established (and, if applicable, designated) by the individual under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Establishment and designation of Medicare+Choice medical savings account as requirement for payment of contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of an individual who has elected coverage under an MSA plan, no payment shall be made under paragraph (1) on behalf of an individual for a month unless the individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) has established before the beginning of the month (or by such other deadline as the Secretary may specify) a Medicare+Choice MSA (as defined in section 138(b)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) if the individual has established more than one such Medicare+Choice MSA, has designated one of such accounts as the individual's Medicare+Choice MSA for purposes of this part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the actuarial value of the required benefits described in section 1395w&ndash;22(a)(1)(A) of this title under the plan for individuals under this part, as determined based upon an adjusted community rate described in paragraph (3) (as reduced for the actuarial value of the coinsurance, copayments, and deductibles under parts A and B of this subchapter).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Adjusted excess amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the &ldquo;adjusted excess amount&rdquo;, for an organization for a plan, is the excess amount reduced to reflect any amount withheld and reserved for the organization for the year under paragraph (2).</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Uniform application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">This paragraph shall be applied uniformly for all enrollees for a plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Construction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as preventing a Medicare+Choice organization from providing supplemental benefits (described in section 1395w&ndash;22(a)(3) of this title) that are in addition to the health care benefits otherwise required to be provided under this paragraph and from imposing a premium for such supplemental benefits.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Stabilization fund</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A Medicare+Choice organization may provide that a part of the value of an excess amount described in paragraph (1) be withheld and reserved in the Federal Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and in the Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund (in such proportions as the Secretary determines to be appropriate) by the Secretary for subsequent annual contract periods, to the extent required to stabilize and prevent undue fluctuations in the additional benefits offered in those subsequent periods by the organization in accordance with such paragraph. Any of such value of the amount reserved which is not provided as additional benefits described in paragraph (1)(A) to individuals electing the Medicare+Choice plan of the organization in accordance with such paragraph prior to the end of such periods, shall revert for the use of such trust funds.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Adjusted community rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, subject to paragraph (4), the term &ldquo;adjusted community rate&rdquo; for a service or services means, at the election of a Medicare+Choice organization, either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the rate of payment for that service or services which the Secretary annually determines would apply to an individual electing a Medicare+Choice plan under this part if the rate of payment were determined under a &ldquo;community rating system&rdquo; (as defined in section 300e&ndash;1(8) of this title, other than subparagraph (C)), or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such portion of the weighted aggregate premium, which the Secretary annually estimates would apply to such an individual, as the Secretary annually estimates is attributable to that service or services,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1922 --><p class="statutory-body-block-1em">but adjusted for differences between the utilization characteristics of the individuals electing coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the other enrollees with the plan (or, if the Secretary finds that adequate data are not available to adjust for those differences, the differences between the utilization characteristics of individuals selecting other Medicare+Choice coverage, or Medicare+Choice eligible individuals in the area, in the State, or in the United States, eligible to elect Medicare+Choice coverage under this part and the utilization characteristics of the rest of the population in the area, in the State, or in the United States, respectively).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Determination based on insufficient data</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, if the Secretary finds that there is insufficient enrollment experience to determine an average of the capitation payments to be made under this part at the beginning of a contract period or to determine (in the case of a newly operated provider-sponsored organization or other new organization) the adjusted community rate for the organization, the Secretary may determine such an average based on the enrollment experience of other contracts entered into under this part and may determine such a rate using data in the general commercial marketplace.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Prohibition of State imposition of premium taxes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No State may impose a premium tax or similar tax with respect to payments to Medicare+Choice organizations under section 1395w&ndash;23 of this title.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1395w&ndash;25. Organizational and financial requirements for Medicare+Choice organizations; provider-sponsored organizations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Organized and licensed under State law</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Subject to paragraphs (2) and (3), a Medicare+Choice organization shall be organized and licensed under State law as a risk-bearing entity eligible to offer health insurance or health benefits coverage in each State in which it offers a Medicare+Choice plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Special exception for provider-sponsored organizations</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a provider-sponsored organization that seeks to offer a Medicare+Choice plan in a State, the Secretary shall waive the requirement of paragraph (1) that the organization be licensed in that State if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the organization files an application for such waiver with the Secretary by not later than November 1, 2002, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the Secretary determines, based on the application and other evidence presented to the Secretary, that any of the grounds for approval of the application described in subparagraph (B), (C), or (D) has been met.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Failure to act on licensure application on a timely basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has failed to complete action on a licensing application of the organization within 90 days of the date of the State's receipt of a substantially complete application. No period before August 5, 1997, shall be included in determining such 90-day period.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Denial of application based on discriminatory treatment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has denied such a licensing application and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the standards or review process imposed by the State as a condition of approval of the license imposes any material requirements, procedures, or standards (other than solvency requirements) to such organizations that are not generally applicable to other entities engaged in a substantially similar business, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the State requires the organization, as a condition of licensure, to offer any product or plan other than a Medicare+ï¿½Choice plan.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(D) Denial of application based on application of solvency requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">With respect to waiver applications filed on or after the date of publication of solvency standards under section 1395w&ndash;26(a) of this title, the ground for approval of such a waiver application described in this subparagraph is that the State has denied such a licensing application based (in whole or in part) on the organization's failure to meet applicable solvency requirements and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) such requirements are not the same as the solvency standards established under section 1395w&ndash;26(a) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the State has imposed as a condition of approval of the license documentation or information requirements relating to solvency or other material requirements, procedures, or standards relating to solvency that are different from the requirements, procedures, and standards applied by the Secretary under subsection (d)(2) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;solvency requirements&rdquo; means requirements relating to solvency and other matters covered under the standards established under section 1395w&ndash;26(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(E) Treatment of waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In the case of a waiver granted under this paragraph for a provider-sponsored organization with respect to a State&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1923 --><h4 class="clause-head">(i) Limitation to State</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The waiver shall be effective only with respect to that State and does not apply to any other State.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Limitation to 36-month period</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The waiver shall be effective only for a 36-month period and may not be renewed.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Conditioned on compliance with consumer protection and quality standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">The continuation of the waiver is conditioned upon the organization's compliance with the requirements described in subparagraph (G).</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iv) Preemption of State law</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">Any provisions of law of that State which relate to the licensing of the organization and which prohibit the organization from providing coverage pursuant to a contract under this part shall be superseded.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(F) Prompt action on application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall grant or deny such a waiver application within 60 days after the date the Secretary determines that a substantially complete waiver application has been filed. Nothing in this section shall be construed as preventing an organization which has had such a waiver application denied from submitting a subsequent waiver application.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(G) Application and enforcement of State consumer protection and quality standards</h4>
<h4 class="clause-head">(i) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">A waiver granted under this paragraph to an organization with respect to licensing under State law is conditioned upon the organization's compliance with all consumer protection and quality standards insofar as such standards&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(I) would apply in the State to the organization if it were licensed under State law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(II) are generally applicable to other Medicare+Choice organizations and plans in the State; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-4em">(III) are consistent with the standards established under this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;Such standards shall not include any standard preempted under section 1395w&ndash;26(b)(3)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(ii) Incorporation into contract</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of such a waiver granted to an organization with respect to a State, the Secretary shall incorporate the requirement that the organization (and Medicare+Choice plans it offers) comply with standards under clause (i) as part of the contract between the Secretary and the organization under section 1395w&ndash;27 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="clause-head">(iii) Enforcement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">In the case of such a waiver granted to an organization with respect to a State, the Secretary may enter into an agreement with the State under which the State agrees to provide for monitoring and enforcement activities with respect to compliance of such an organization and its Medicare+Choice plans with such standards. Such monitoring and enforcement shall be conducted by the State in the same manner as the State enforces such standards with respect to other Medicare+Choice organizations and plans, without discrimination based on the type of organization to which the standards apply. Such an agreement shall specify or establish mechanisms by which compliance activities are undertaken, while not lengthening the time required to review and process applications for waivers under this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(H) Report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">By not later than December 31, 2001, the Secretary shall submit to the Committee on Ways and Means and the Committee on Commerce of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Finance of the Senate a report regarding whether the waiver process under this paragraph should be continued after December 31, 2002. In making such recommendation, the Secretary shall consider, among other factors, the impact of such process on beneficiaries and on the long-term solvency of the program under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Licensure does not substitute for or constitute certification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The fact that an organization is licensed in accordance with paragraph (1) does not deem the organization to meet other requirements imposed under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assumption of full financial risk</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Medicare+Choice organization shall assume full financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of the health care services for which benefits are required to be provided under section 1395w&ndash;22(a)(1) of this title, except that the organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for the cost of providing to any enrolled member such services the aggregate value of which exceeds such aggregate level as the Secretary specifies from time to time,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for the cost of such services provided to its enrolled members other than through the organization because medical necessity required their provision before they could be secured through the organization,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) may obtain insurance or make other arrangements for not more than 90 percent of the amount by which its costs for any of its fiscal years exceed 115 percent of its income for such fiscal year, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) may make arrangements with physicians or other health care professionals, health care institutions, or any combination of such individuals or institutions to assume all or part of the financial risk on a prospective basis for the provision of basic health services by the physicians or other health professionals or through the institutions.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1924 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Certification of provision against risk of insolvency for unlicensed PSOs</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Each Medicare+Choice organization that is a provider-sponsored organization, that is not licensed by a State under subsection (a) of this section, and for which a waiver application has been approved under subsection (a)(2) of this section, shall meet standards established under section 1395w&ndash;26(a) of this title relating to the financial solvency and capital adequacy of the organization.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification process for solvency standards for PSOs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish a process for the receipt and approval of applications of a provider-sponsored organization described in paragraph (1) for certification (and periodic recertification) of the organization as meeting such solvency standards. Under such process, the Secretary shall act upon such a certification application not later than 60 days after the date the application has been received.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Provider-sponsored organization&rdquo; defined</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this part, the term &ldquo;provider-sponsored organization&rdquo; means a public or private entity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) that is established or organized, and operated, by a health care provider, or group of affiliated health care providers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) that provides a substantial proportion (as defined by the Secretary in accordance with paragraph (2)) of the health care items and services under the contract under this part directly through the provider or affiliated group of providers, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) with respect to which the affiliated providers share, directly or indirectly, substantial financial risk with respect to the provision of such items and services and have at least a majority financial interest in the entity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Substantial proportion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In defining what is a &ldquo;substantial proportion&rdquo; for purposes of paragraph (1)(B), the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) shall take into account the need for such an organization to assume responsibility for providing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) significantly more than the majority of the items and services under the contract under this section through its own affiliated providers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) most of the remainder of the items and services under the contract through providers with which the organization has an agreement to provide such items and services,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-2em">in order to assure financial stability and to address the practical considerations involved in integrating the delivery of a wide range of service providers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) shall take into account the need for such an organization to provide a limited proportion of the items and services under the contract through providers that are neither affiliated with nor have an agreement with the organization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) may allow for variation in the definition of substantial proportion among such organizations based on relevant differences among the organizations, such as their location in an urban or rural area.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Affiliation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, a provider is &ldquo;affiliated&rdquo; with another provider if, through contract, ownership, or otherwise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) one provider, directly or indirectly, controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with the other,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) both providers are part of a controlled group of corporations under section 1563 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) each provider is a participant in a lawful combination under which each provider shares substantial financial risk in connection with the organization's operations, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) both providers are part of an affiliated service group under section 414 of such Code.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Control</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of paragraph (3), control is presumed to exist if one party, directly or indirectly, owns, controls, or holds the power to vote, or proxies for, not less than 51 percent of the voting rights or governance rights of another.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) &ldquo;Health care provider&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In this subsection, the term &ldquo;health care provider&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any individual who is engaged in the delivery of health care services in a State and who is required by State law or regulation to be licensed or certified by the State to engage in the delivery of such services in the State, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any entity that is engaged in the delivery of health care services in a State and that, if it is required by State law or regulation to be licensed or certified by the State to engage in the delivery of such services in the State, is so licensed.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall issue regulations to carry out this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Establishment</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The Secretary shall establish, on an expedited basis and using a negotiated rulemaking process under subchapter III of <!-- PDFPage:1925 -->chapter 5 of title 5, standards described in section 1395w&ndash;25(c)(1) of this title (relating to the financial solvency and capital adequacy of the organization) that entities must meet to qualify as provider-sponsored organizations under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Factors to consider for solvency standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">In establishing solvency standards under subparagraph (A) for provider-sponsored organizations, the Secretary shall consult with interested parties and shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the delivery system assets of such an organization and ability of such an organization to provide services directly to enrollees through affiliated providers,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) alternative means of protecting against insolvency, including reinsurance, unrestricted surplus, letters of credit, guarantees, organizational insurance coverage, partnerships with other licensed entities, and valuation attributable to the ability of such an organization to meet its service obligations through direct delivery of care, and</p>

<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Enrollee protection against insolvency</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Such standards shall include provisions to prevent enrollees from being held liable to any person or entity for the Medicare+ï¿½Choice organization's debts in the event of the organization's insolvency.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Publication of notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In carrying out the rulemaking process under this subsection, the Secretary, after consultation with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the American Academy of Actuaries, organizations representative of medicare beneficiaries, and other interested parties, shall publish the notice provided for under section 564(a) of title 5 by not later than 45 days after August 5, 1997.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Target date for publication of rule</h4>

If the committee reports that the committee has failed to make significant progress towards such consensus or is unlikely to reach such consensus by the target date, the Secretary may terminate such process and provide for the publication of a rule under this subsection through such other methods as the Secretary may provide.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Final committee report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the committee is not terminated under paragraph (6), the rulemaking committee shall submit a report containing a proposed rule by not later than 1 month before the target date of publication.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(8) Interim, final effect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall publish a rule under this subsection in the Federal Register by not later than the target date of publication. Such rule shall be effective and final immediately on an interim basis, but is subject to change and revision after public notice and opportunity for a period (of not less than 60 days) for public comment. In connection with such rule, the Secretary shall specify the process for the timely review and approval of applications of entities to be certified as provider-sponsored organizations pursuant to such rules and consistent with this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(9) Publication of rule after public comment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall provide for consideration of such comments and republication of such rule by not later than 1 year after the target date of publication.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Establishment of other standards</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall establish by regulation other standards (not described in subsection (a) of this section) for Medicare+Choice organizations and plans consistent with, and to carry out, this part. The Secretary shall publish such regulations by June 1, 1998. In order to carry out this requirement in a timely manner, the Secretary may promulgate regulations that take effect on an interim basis, after notice and pending opportunity for public comment.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Use of current standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Consistent with the requirements of this part, standards established under this subsection shall be based on standards established under section 1395mm of this title to carry out analogous provisions of such section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Relation to State laws</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">The standards established under this subsection shall supersede any State law or reg<!-- PDFPage:1926 -->ulation (including standards described in subparagraph (B)) with respect to Medicare+ï¿½Choice plans which are offered by Medicare+ï¿½Choice organizations under this part to the extent such law or regulation is inconsistent with such standards.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Standards specifically superseded</h4>
