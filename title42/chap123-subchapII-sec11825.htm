<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent to which such project or activity serves communities which have high rates of illicit drug use by juveniles (including runaway and homeless youth),</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the extent to which such project or activity will provide services in geographical areas where similar services are unavailable or in short supply, and</p>
