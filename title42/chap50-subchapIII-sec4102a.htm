<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Matching requirement</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), in any fiscal year the Director may not provide assistance under this section to a State or community in an amount exceeding 3 times the amount that the State or community certifies, as the Director shall require, that the State or community will contribute from non-Federal funds for carrying out the eligible activities to be funded with such assistance amounts.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Reduced community match</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">With respect to any 1-year period in which assistance is made available under this section, the Director may adjust the contribution required under paragraph (1) by any State, and for the communities located in that State, to not less than 10 percent of the cost of the activities for each severe repetitive loss property for which grant amounts are provided if, for such year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the State has an approved State mitigation plan meeting the requirements for hazard mitigation planning under section 5165 of this title that specifies how the State intends to reduce the number of severe repetitive loss properties; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Director determines, after consultation with the State, that the State has taken actions to reduce the number of such properties.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Non-Federal funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;non-Federal funds&rdquo; includes State or local agency funds, in-kind contributions, any salary paid to staff to carry out the eligible ac<!-- PDFPage:5187 -->tivities of the recipient, the value of the time and services contributed by volunteers to carry out such activities (at a rate determined by the Director), and the value of any donated material or building and the value of any lease on a building.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The program under this section for providing assistance for eligible activities for severe repetitive loss properties shall be subject to the following limitations:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Priority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining the properties for which to provide assistance for eligible activities under subsection (c) of this section, the Director shall provide assistance for properties in the order that will result in the greatest amount of savings to the National Flood Insurance Fund in the shortest period of time, in a manner consistent with the allocation formula under paragraph (5).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall provide assistance in a manner that permits States and communities to make offers to owners of severe repetitive loss properties to take eligible activities under subsection (c) of this section as soon as practicable.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In determining for which eligible activities under subsection (c) of this section to provide assistance with respect to a severe repetitive loss property, the relevant States and communities shall consult, to the extent practicable, with the owner of the property.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Deference to local mitigation decisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall not, by rule, regulation, or order, establish a priority for funding eligible activities under this section that gives preference to one type or category of eligible activity over any other type or category of eligible activity.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Allocation</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Subject to subparagraphs (B) and (C), of the total amount made available for assistance under this section in any fiscal year, the Director shall allocate assistance to a State, and the communities located within that State, based upon the percentage of the total number of severe repetitive loss properties located within that State.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Redistribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any funds allocated to a State, and the communities within the State, under subparagraph (A) that have not been obligated by the end of each fiscal year shall be redistributed by the Director to other States and communities to carry out eligible activities in accordance with this section.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Exception</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) are located in States that receive little or no assistance, as determined by the Director, under the allocation formula under subparagraph (A).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Notice</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Upon making an offer to provide assistance with respect to a property for any eligible activity under subsection (c) of this section, the State or community shall notify each holder of a recorded interest on the property of such offer and activity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Purchase offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A State or community may take action under subsection (c)(2) of this section to purchase a severe repetitive loss property only if the following requirements are met:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Use of property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State or community enters into an agreement with the Director that provides assurances that the property purchased will be used in a manner that is consistent with the requirements of section 5170c(b)(2)(B) of this title for properties acquired, accepted, or from which a structure will be removed pursuant to a project provided property acquisition and relocation assistance under such section 5170c(b) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Offers</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall provide assistance in a manner that permits States and communities to make offers to owners of severe repetitive loss properties and of associated land to engage in eligible activities as soon as possible.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Comparable housing payment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If a purchase offer made under paragraph (2) is less than the cost of the homeowner-occupant to purchase a comparable replacement dwelling outside the flood hazard area in the same community, the Director shall make available an additional relocation payment to the homeowner-occupant to apply to the difference.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Increased premiums in cases of refusal to mitigate</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) notify each holder of a recorded interest on the property of such refusal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) notwithstanding subsections (a) through (c) of section 4015 of this title, thereafter the chargeable premium rate with respect to the property shall be the amount equal to 150 percent of the chargeable rate for the property at the time that the offer was made, as adjusted by any other premium adjustments otherwise applicable to the property and any subsequent increases pursuant to paragraph (2) and subject to the limitation under paragraph (3).</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Increased premiums upon subsequent flood damage</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Limitation on increased premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In no case may the chargeable premium rate for a severe repetitive loss property be increased pursuant to this subsection to an amount exceeding the applicable estimated risk premium rate for the area (or subdivision thereof) under section 4014(a)(1) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">Any owner of a severe repetitive loss property may appeal a determination of the Director to take action under paragraph (1)(B) or (2) with respect to such property, based only upon the following grounds:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) As a result of such action, the owner of the property will not be able to purchase a replacement primary residence of comparable value and that is functionally equivalent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Based on independent information, such as contractor estimates or appraisals, the property owner believes that the price offered for purchasing the property is not an accurate estimation of the value of the property, or the amount of Federal funds offered for mitigation activities, when combined with funds from non-Federal sources, will not cover the actual cost of mitigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) As a result of such action, the preservation or maintenance of any prehistoric or historic district, site, building, structure, or object included in, or eligible for inclusion in, the National Register of Historic Places will be interfered with, impaired, or disrupted.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) The flooding that resulted in the flood insurance claims described in subsection (b)(2) of this section for the property resulted from significant actions by a third party in violation of Federal, State, or local law, ordinance, or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) In purchasing the property, the owner relied upon flood insurance rate maps of the Federal Emergency Management Agency that were current at the time and did not indicate that the property was located in an area having special flood hazards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) The owner of the property, based on independent information, such as contractor estimates or other appraisals, demonstrates that an alternative eligible activity under subsection (c) of this section is at least as cost effective as the initial offer of assistance.</p>
