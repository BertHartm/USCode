<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of a closure-acceleration project shall be, within a fixed period of time, to clean up or decommission a Department of Energy defense nuclear facility or portion thereof and to make the facility safe by stabilizing, consolidat<!-- PDFPage:4944 -->ing, treating, or removing nuclear materials from the facility in order to reduce significantly or eliminate future costs at the facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligible projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Energy may establish a closure-acceleration project as eligible for selection under subsection (e) of this section by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) determining that the project will achieve significant long-term cost savings to the Federal Government from the baseline cost estimate made by the Department of Energy for the project.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(3) If a closure-acceleration project is being carried out at a defense nuclear facility with funds appropriated for such projects, the Secretary of Energy may not reduce the funds otherwise allocated to that defense nuclear facility for environmental restoration and waste management by reason of the funds being used for the project at that facility.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Funds appropriated for purposes of carrying out projects under this section may not be used for an item for which Congress has specifically denied funds or for a new program or project that has not been authorized by Congress.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) The Secretary may waive the applicability of paragraph (1) or (2) to an employee otherwise covered by such paragraph if the Secretary determines that there is good and sufficient reason for the waiver.</p>
