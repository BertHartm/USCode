<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States has survived a period of energy shortage and has made significant progress toward improving energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) effective measures must continue to be taken by the Federal Government and other users and suppliers of energy to control the rate of growth of demand for energy and the efficiency of its use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the continuation of this effort will permit the United States to become increasingly independent of the world oil market, less vulnerable to interruption of foreign oil supplies, and more able to provide energy to meet future needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) all sectors of the economy of the United States should continue to reduce significantly <!-- PDFPage:4957 -->the demand for nonrenewable energy resources such as oil and natural gas by implementing and maintaining effective conservation measures for the efficient use of these and other energy sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are to provide for the regulation of interstate commerce, to reduce the growth in demand for energy in the United States, and to conserve nonrenewable energy resources produced in this Nation and elsewhere, without inhibiting beneficial economic growth.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8232. Residential energy efficiency standards study</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Energy, and such other representatives of Federal, State, and local governments as the Secretary shall designate, conduct a study, utilizing the services of the National Institute of Building Sciences pursuant to appropriate contractual arrangements, for the purpose of determining the need for, the feasibility of, and the problems of requiring, by mandatory Federal action, that all residential dwelling units meet applicable energy efficient standards. The subjects to be examined shall include, but not be limited to, mandatory notification to purchasers, and policies to prohibit exchange or sale, of properties which do not conform to such standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Specific factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In conducting such study, the Secretary shall consider at least the following factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the extent to which such requirement would protect a prospective purchaser from the uncertainty of not knowing the energy efficiency of the property he proposes to purchase;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which such requirement would contribute to the Nation's energy conservation goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which such a requirement would affect the real estate, home building, and mortgage banking industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the sanctions which might be necessary to make such a requirement effective and the administrative impediments there might be to enforcement of such sanctions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the possible impact on sellers and purchasers as a result of the implementation of mandatory Federal actions, taking into account the experience of the Federal Government in imposing mandatory requirements concerning the purchase and sale of real property as occurred under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 [12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.] and the Federal Disaster Protection Act of 1973;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) an analysis of the effect of such a requirement on the economy as a whole and on the Nation's security as compared to the impact on the credit and housing markets caused by such a requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the effect of such a requirement on availability of credit in the housing industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the extent to which the imposition of mandatory Federal requirements would temporarily reduce the number of residential dwellings available for sale and the resulting effect of such mandatory actions on the price of those remaining dwelling units eligible for sale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the possible uncertainty, during the period of developing the standards, as to what standards might be imposed and any resulting effect on major housing rehabilitation efforts and voluntary efforts for energy conservation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Comments and findings by Secretary of Energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall incorporate into such study comments by the Secretary of Energy on the effects on the economy as a whole and on <!-- PDFPage:4959 -->the Nation's security which may result from the requirement described in subsection (a) of this section as compared to the impact on the credit and housing markets likely to be caused by such a requirement. In addition, the Secretary shall incorporate into such study the following findings by the Secretary of Energy:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the savings in energy costs resulting from the requirement described in subsection (a) of this section throughout the estimated remaining useful life of the existing residential buildings to which such requirement would apply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total cost per barrel of oil equivalent, in obtaining the energy savings likely to result from such requirement, computed for each class of existing residential buildings to which such requirement would apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall report, no later than one year after November 9, 1978, to both Houses of the Congress with regard to the findings made as a result of such study along with any recommendations for legislative proposals which the Secretary determines should be enacted with respect to the subject of such study.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8253. Energy management requirements</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Energy performance requirement for Federal buildings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Subject to paragraph (2), each agency shall apply energy conservation measures to, and shall improve the design for the construction of, its Federal buildings so that the energy consumption per gross square foot of its Federal buildings in use during the fiscal year 1995 is at least 10 percent less than the energy consumption per gross square foot of its Federal buildings in use during the fiscal year 1985 and so that the energy consumption per gross square foot of its Federal buildings in use during the fiscal year 2000 is at least 20 percent less than the energy consumption per gross square foot of its Federal buildings in use during fiscal year 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An agency may exclude from the requirements of paragraph (1) any building, and the associated energy consumption and gross square footage, in which energy intensive activities are carried out. Each agency shall identify and list in each report made under section 8258(a) of this title the buildings designated by it for such exclusion.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Energy management requirement for Federal agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than January 1, 2005, each agency shall, to the maximum extent practicable, install in Federal buildings owned by the United States all energy and water conservation measures with payback periods of less than 10 years, as determined by using the methods and procedures developed pursuant to section 8254 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary may waive the requirements of this subsection for any agency for such periods as the Secretary may determine if the Secretary finds that the agency is taking all practicable steps to meet the requirements and that the requirements of this subsection will pose an unacceptable burden upon the agency. If the Secretary waives the requirements of this subsection, the Secretary shall, as part of the report required under section 8258(b) of this title, notify the Congress in writing with an explanation and a justification of the reasons for such waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) This subsection shall not apply to an agency's facilities that generate or transmit electric energy or to the uranium enrichment facilities operated by the Department of Energy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An agency may participate in the Environmental Protection Agency's &ldquo;Green Lights&rdquo; program for purposes of receiving technical assistance in complying with the requirements of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exclusions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An agency may exclude, from the energy consumption requirements for the year 2000 established under subsection (a) of this section and the requirements of subsection (b)(1) of this section, any Federal building or collection of Federal buildings, and the associated energy consumption and gross square footage, if the head of such agency finds that compliance with such requirements would be impractical. A finding of impracticability shall be based on the energy intensiveness of activities carried out in such Federal buildings or collection of Federal buildings, the type and amount of energy consumed, the technical feasibility of making the desired changes, and, in the cases of the Departments of Defense and Energy, the unique char<!-- PDFPage:4966 -->acter of certain facilities operated by such Departments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each agency shall identify and list, in each report made under section 8258(a) of this title, the Federal buildings designated by it for such exclusion. The Secretary shall review such findings for consistency with the impracticability standards set forth in paragraph (1), and may within 90 days after receipt of the findings, reverse a finding of impracticability. In the case of any such reversal, the agency shall comply with the energy consumption requirements for the building concerned.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Implementation steps</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall consult with the Secretary of Defense and the Administrator of General Services in developing guidelines for the implementation of this part. To meet the requirements of this section, each agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) prepare and submit to the Secretary, not later than December 31, 1993, a plan describing how the agency intends to meet such requirements, including how it will&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) designate personnel primarily responsible for achieving such requirements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) identify high priority projects through calculation of payback periods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) take maximum advantage of contracts authorized under subchapter VII of this chapter, of financial incentives and other services provided by utilities for efficiency investment, and of other forms of financing to reduce the direct costs to the Government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) otherwise implement this part;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) perform energy surveys of its Federal buildings to the extent necessary and update such surveys as needed, incorporating any relevant information obtained from the survey conducted pursuant to section 8258b of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) using such surveys, determine the cost and payback period of energy and water conservation measures likely to achieve the requirements of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) install energy and water conservation measures that will achieve the requirements of this section through the methods and procedures established pursuant to section 8254 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ensure that the operation and maintenance procedures applied under this section are continued.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The head of a Federal agency may enter into contracts under this subchapter solely for the purpose of achieving energy savings and benefits ancillary to that purpose. Each such contract may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be for a period not to exceed 25 years. Such contract shall provide that the contractor shall incur costs of implementing energy savings measures, including at least the costs (if any) incurred in making energy audits, acquiring and installing equipment, and training personnel, in exchange for a share of any energy savings directly resulting from implementation of such measures during the term of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Contracts under this subchapter shall be energy savings performance contracts and shall <!-- PDFPage:4982 -->require an annual energy audit and specify the terms and conditions of any Government payments and performance guarantees. Any such performance guarantee shall provide that the contractor is responsible for maintenance and repair services for any energy related equipment, including computer software systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Aggregate annual payments by an agency to both utilities and energy savings performance contractors, under an energy savings performance contract, may not exceed the amount that the agency would have paid for utilities without an energy savings performance contract (as estimated through the procedures developed pursuant to this section) during contract years. The contract shall provide for a guarantee of savings to the agency, and shall establish payment schedules reflecting such guarantee, taking into account any capital costs under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Federal agencies may incur obligations pursuant to such contracts to finance energy conservation measures provided guaranteed savings exceed the debt service requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A Federal agency may enter into a multiyear contract under this subchapter for a period not to exceed 25 years, without funding of cancellation charges before cancellation, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) such contract was awarded in a competitive manner pursuant to subsection (b)(2) of this section, using procedures and methods established under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) funds are available and adequate for payment of the costs of such contract for the first fiscal year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) 30 days before the award of any such contract that contains a clause setting forth a cancellation ceiling in excess of $750,000, the head of such agency gives written notification of such proposed contract and of the proposed cancellation ceiling for such contract to the appropriate authorizing and appropriating committees of the Congress; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) such contract is governed by part 17.1 of the Federal Acquisition Regulation promulgated under section 421 of title 41 or the applicable rules promulgated under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Implementation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary, with the concurrence of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council established under section 421(a) of title 41, not later than 180 days after October 24, 1992, shall, by rule, establish appropriate procedures and methods for use by Federal agencies to select, monitor, and terminate contracts with energy service contractors in accordance with laws governing Federal procurement that will achieve the intent of this section in a cost-effective manner. In developing such procedures and methods, the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council, shall determine which existing regulations are inconsistent with the intent of this section and shall formulate substitute regulations consistent with laws governing Federal procurement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The procedures and methods established pursuant to subparagraph (A) shall be the procedures and contracting methods for selection, by an agency, of a contractor to provide energy savings performance services. Such procedures and methods shall provide for the calculation of energy savings based on sound engineering and financial practices.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The procedures and methods established pursuant to paragraph (1)(A) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) allow the Secretary to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) request statements of qualifications, which shall, at a minimum, include prior experience and capabilities of contractors to perform the proposed types of energy savings services and financial and performance information, from firms engaged in providing energy savings services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) from the statements received, designate and prepare a list, with an update at least annually, of those firms that are qualified to provide energy savings services;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) require each agency to use the list prepared by the Secretary pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) unless the agency elects to develop an agency list of firms qualified to provide energy savings performance services using the same selection procedures and methods as are required of the Secretary in preparing such lists; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) allow the head of each agency to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) select firms from the list prepared pursuant to subparagraph (A)(ii) or the list prepared by the agency pursuant to subparagraph (B) to conduct discussions concerning a particular proposed energy savings project, including requesting a technical and price proposal from such selected firms for such project;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) select from such firms the most qualified firm to provide energy savings services based on technical and price proposals and any other relevant information;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) permit receipt of unsolicited proposals for energy savings performance contracting services from a firm that such agency has determined is qualified to provide such services under the procedures established pursuant to paragraph (1)(A), and require agency facility managers to place a notice in the Commerce Business Daily announcing they have received such a proposal and invite other similarly qualified firms to submit competing proposals; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) enter into an energy savings performance contract with a firm qualified under clause (iii), consistent with the procedures and methods established pursuant to paragraph (1)(A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A firm not designated as qualified to provide energy savings services under paragraph (2)(A)(i) or paragraph (2)(B) may request a review of such decision to be conducted in accordance with procedures to be developed by the board of contract appeals of the General Services Administration.</p>
