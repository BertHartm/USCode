<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the United States has survived a period of energy shortage and has made significant progress toward improving energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) effective measures must continue to be taken by the Federal Government and other users and suppliers of energy to control the rate of growth of demand for energy and the efficiency of its use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the continuation of this effort will permit the United States to become increasingly independent of the world oil market, less vulnerable to interruption of foreign oil supplies, and more able to provide energy to meet future needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) all sectors of the economy of the United States should continue to reduce significantly the demand for nonrenewable energy resources such as oil and natural gas by implementing and maintaining effective conservation measures for the efficient use of these and other energy sources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Statement of purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purposes of this chapter are to provide for the regulation of interstate commerce, to reduce <!-- PDFPage:6557 -->the growth in demand for energy in the United States, and to conserve nonrenewable energy resources produced in this Nation and elsewhere, without inhibiting beneficial economic growth.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Amendments</h4>
<p class="note-body"><b>1986</b>&mdash;Subsec. (a). Pub. L. 99&ndash;412 amended subsec. (a) generally. Prior to amendment, subsec. (a) read as follows: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the United States faces an energy shortage arising from increasing demand for energy, particularly for oil and natural gas, and insufficient domestic supplies of oil and natural gas to satisfy that demand;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) unless effective measures are promptly taken by the Federal Government and other users of energy to reduce the rate of growth of demand for energy, the United States will become increasingly dependent on the world oil market, increasingly vulnerable to interruptions of foreign oil supplies, and unable to provide the energy to meet future needs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) all sectors of our Nation's economy must begin immediately to significantly reduce the demand for nonrenewable energy resources such as oil and natural gas by implementing and maintaining effective conservation measures for the efficient use of these and other energy sources.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is authorized to make grants to finance energy conserving improvements (as defined in subparagraph (2) of the last paragraph of section 1703(a) of title 12) to projects which are financed with loans under section 1701q of title 12, or which are subject to mortgages insured under section 1715<em>l</em>(d)(3) or section 1715z&ndash;1 of title 12. The Secretary shall make assistance available under this section on a priority basis to those projects which are in financial difficulty as a result of high energy costs. In carrying out the program authorized by this section, the Secretary shall issue regulations requiring that any grant made under this section shall be made only on the condition that the recipient of such grant shall take steps (prescribed by the Secretary) to assure that the benefits derived from such grants in terms of lower energy costs shall accrue to tenants in the form of lower rentals or to the Federal Government in the form of a lower operating subsidy if such a subsidy is being paid to such recipient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall establish minimum standards for energy conserving improvements to multifamily dwelling units to be assisted under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the provisions of this section not to exceed $25,000,000.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8232. Residential energy efficiency standards study</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) General authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (hereinafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo;) shall, in coordination with the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, the Secretary of Energy, and such other representatives of Federal, State, and local governments as the Secretary shall designate, conduct a study, utilizing the services of the National Institute of Building Sciences pursuant to appropriate contractual arrangements, for the purpose of determining the need for, the feasibility of, and the problems of requiring, by mandatory Federal action, that all residential dwelling units meet applicable energy efficient standards. The subjects to be examined shall include, but not be limited to, mandatory notification to purchasers, and policies to prohibit exchange or sale, of properties which do not conform to such standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Specific factors</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In conducting such study, the Secretary shall consider at least the following factors&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the extent to which such requirement would protect a prospective purchaser from the uncertainty of not knowing the energy efficiency of the property he proposes to purchase;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which such requirement would contribute to the Nation's energy conservation goals;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the extent to which such a requirement would affect the real estate, home building, and mortgage banking industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the sanctions which might be necessary to make such a requirement effective and the administrative impediments there might be to enforcement of such sanctions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the possible impact on sellers and purchasers as a result of the implementation of mandatory Federal actions, taking into account the experience of the Federal Government in imposing mandatory requirements concerning the purchase and sale of real property as occurred under the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 [12 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.] and the Federal Disaster Protection Act of 1973;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) an analysis of the effect of such a requirement on the economy as a whole and on the Nation's security as compared to the impact on the credit and housing markets caused by such a requirement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the effect of such a requirement on availability of credit in the housing industry;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) the extent to which the imposition of mandatory Federal requirements would temporarily reduce the number of residential dwellings available for sale and the resulting effect of such mandatory actions on the price of those remaining dwelling units eligible for sale; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) the possible uncertainty, during the period of developing the standards, as to what standards might be imposed and any resulting effect on major housing rehabilitation efforts and voluntary efforts for energy conservation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Comments and findings by Secretary of Energy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall incorporate into such study comments by the Secretary of Energy on the effects on the economy as a whole and on the Nation's security which may result from the requirement described in subsection (a) of this section as compared to the impact on the credit and housing markets likely to be caused by such a requirement. In addition, the Secretary shall incorporate into such study the following findings by the Secretary of Energy:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the savings in energy costs resulting from the requirement described in subsection (a) of <!-- PDFPage:6559 -->this section throughout the estimated remaining useful life of the existing residential buildings to which such requirement would apply; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the total cost per barrel of oil equivalent, in obtaining the energy savings likely to result from such requirement, computed for each class of existing residential buildings to which such requirement would apply.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Report date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall report, no later than one year after November 9, 1978, to both Houses of the Congress with regard to the findings made as a result of such study along with any recommendations for legislative proposals which the Secretary determines should be enacted with respect to the subject of such study.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) National Assessment and report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (&ldquo;Commission&rdquo;) shall conduct a National Assessment of Demand Response. The Commission shall, within 18 months of December 19, 2007, submit a report to Congress that includes each of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Estimation of nationwide demand response potential in 5 and 10 year horizons, including data on a State-by-State basis, and a methodology for updates of such estimates on an annual basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Estimation of how much of this potential can be achieved within 5 and 10 years after December 19, 2007, accompanied by specific policy recommendations that if implemented can achieve the estimated potential. Such recommendations shall include options for funding and/or incentives for the development of demand response resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The Commission shall further note any barriers to demand response programs offering flexible, non-discriminatory, and fairly compensatory terms for the services and benefits made available, and shall provide recommendations for overcoming such barriers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The Commission shall seek to take advantage of preexisting research and ongoing work, and shall insure that there is no duplication of effort.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) National Action Plan on Demand Response</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commission shall further develop a National Action Plan on Demand Response, soliciting and accepting input and participation from a broad range of industry stakeholders, State regulatory utility commissioners, and non-governmental groups. The Commission shall seek consensus where possible, and decide on optimum solutions to issues that defy consensus. Such Plan shall be completed within 1 year after the completion of the National Assessment of Demand Response, and shall meet each of the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Identification of requirements for technical assistance to States to allow them to maximize the amount of demand response resources that can be developed and deployed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Design and identification of requirements for implementation of a national communications program that includes broad-based customer education and support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Development or identification of analytical tools, information, model regulatory provisions, model contracts, and other support materials for use by customers, States, utilities and demand response providers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation of Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon completion, the National Action Plan on Demand Response shall be published, together with any favorable and dissenting comments submitted by participants in its preparation. Six months after publication, the Commission, together with the Secretary of Energy, shall submit to Congress a proposal to implement the Action Plan, including specific proposed assignments of responsibility, proposed budget amounts, and any agreements secured for participation from State and other participants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Authorization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to the Commission to carry out this section not more than $10,000,000 for each of the fiscal years 2008, 2009, and 2010.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The head of a Federal agency may enter into contracts under this subchapter solely for the purpose of achieving energy savings and benefits ancillary to that purpose. Each such contract may, notwithstanding any other provision of law, be for a period not to exceed 25 years. Such contract shall provide that the contractor shall incur costs of implementing energy savings measures, including at least the costs (if any) incurred in making energy audits, acquiring and installing equipment, and training personnel, in exchange for a share of any energy savings directly resulting from implementation of such measures during the term of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Contracts under this subchapter shall be energy savings performance contracts and shall require an annual energy audit and specify the terms and conditions of any Government payments and performance guarantees. Any such performance guarantee shall provide that the contractor is responsible for maintenance and repair services for any energy related equipment, including computer software systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Aggregate annual payments by an agency to both utilities and energy savings performance contractors, under an energy savings performance contract, may not exceed the amount that the agency would have paid for utilities without an energy savings performance contract (as estimated through the procedures developed pursuant to this section) during contract years. The contract shall provide for a guarantee of savings to the agency, and shall establish payment schedules reflecting such guarantee, taking into account any capital costs under the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Federal agencies may incur obligations pursuant to such contracts to finance energy conservation measures provided guaranteed savings exceed the debt service requirements.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) A Federal agency may enter into a multiyear contract under this subchapter for a period not to exceed 25 years beginning on the date of the delivery order, without funding of cancellation charges before cancellation, if&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) notifying all contractors that have received an award under such contract that the agency proposes to discuss energy savings performance services for some or all of its facilities and, following a reasonable period of time to provide a proposal in response to the notice, soliciting from such contractors the submission of expressions of interest in, and contractor qualifications for, performing site surveys or investigations and feasibility designs and studies, and including in the notice summary information concerning energy use for any fa<!-- PDFPage:6590 -->cilities that the agency has specific interest in including in such task or delivery order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) reviewing all expressions of interest and qualifications submitted pursuant to the notice under subparagraph (A);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) selecting two or more contractors (from among those reviewed under subparagraph (B)) to conduct discussions concerning the contractors&rsquo; respective qualifications to implement potential energy conservation measures, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) requesting references and specific detailed examples with respect to similar efforts and the resulting energy savings of such similar efforts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) requesting an explanation of how such similar efforts relate to the scope and content of the task or delivery order concerned;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) selecting and authorizing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) more than one contractor (from among those selected under subparagraph (C)) to conduct site surveys, investigations, feasibility designs and studies, or similar assessments for the energy savings performance contract services (or for discrete portions of such services), for the purpose of allowing each such contractor to submit a firm, fixed-price proposal to implement specific energy conservation measures; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) one contractor (from among those selected under subparagraph (C)) to conduct a site survey, investigation, feasibility design and study, or similar assessment for the purpose of allowing the contractor to submit a firm, fixed-price proposal to implement specific energy conservation measures;</p>
