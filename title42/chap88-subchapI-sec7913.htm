The Secretary shall, to the greatest extent practicable, enter into such agreements and carry out such remedial actions in accordance with the priorities established by him under section 7912 of this title. The Secretary shall commence preparations for cooperative agreements with respect to each designated processing site as promptly as practicable following the designation of each site.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Terms and conditions; limitation of Federal assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each cooperative agreement under this section shall contain such terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate and consistent with the purposes of this chapter, including, but not limited to, a limitation on the use of Federal assistance to those costs which are directly required to complete the remedial action selected pursuant to section 7918 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Written consent of record interest holder; waiver</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except where the State is required to acquire the processing site as provided in subsection (a) of section 7914 of this title, each cooperative agreement with a State under this section shall provide that the State shall obtain, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, written consent from any person holding any record interest in the designated processing site for the Secretary or any person designated by him to perform remedial action at such site.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such written consent shall include a waiver by each such person on behalf of himself, his heirs, successors, and assigns&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) releasing the United States of any liability or claim thereof by such person, his heirs, successors, and assigns concerning such remedial action, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) holding the United States harmless against any claim by such person on behalf of himself, his heirs, successors, or assigns arising out of the performance of any such remedial action.</p>
