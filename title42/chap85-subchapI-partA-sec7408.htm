<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Air pollutant list; publication and revision by Administrator; issuance of air quality criteria for air pollutants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For the purpose of establishing national primary and secondary ambient air quality standards, the Administrator shall within 30 days after December 31, 1970, publish, and shall from time to time thereafter revise, a list which includes each air pollutant&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) emissions of which, in his judgment, cause or contribute to air pollution which may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health or welfare;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the presence of which in the ambient air results from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for which air quality criteria had not been issued before December 31, 1970 but for which he plans to issue air quality criteria under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Administrator shall issue air quality criteria for an air pollutant within 12 months after he has included such pollutant in a list under paragraph (1). Air quality criteria for an air pollutant shall accurately reflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating the kind and extent of all identifiable effects on <!-- PDFPage:5376 -->public health or welfare which may be expected from the presence of such pollutant in the ambient air, in varying quantities. The criteria for an air pollutant, to the extent practicable, shall include information on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) those variable factors (including atmospheric conditions) which of themselves or in combination with other factors may alter the effects on public health or welfare of such air pollutant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the types of air pollutants which, when present in the atmosphere, may interact with such pollutant to produce an adverse effect on public health or welfare; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) any known or anticipated adverse effects on welfare.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Issuance by Administrator of information on air pollution control techniques; standing consulting committees for air pollutants; establishment; membership</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Simultaneously with the issuance of criteria under subsection (a) of this section, the Administrator shall, after consultation with appropriate advisory committees and Federal departments and agencies, issue to the States and appropriate air pollution control agencies information on air pollution control techniques, which information shall include data relating to the cost of installation and operation, energy requirements, emission reduction benefits, and environmental impact of the emission control technology. Such information shall include such data as are available on available technology and alternative methods of prevention and control of air pollution. Such information shall also include data on alternative fuels, processes, and operating methods which will result in elimination or significant reduction of emissions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In order to assist in the development of information on pollution control techniques, the Administrator may establish a standing consulting committee for each air pollutant included in a list published pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section, which shall be comprised of technically qualified individuals representative of State and local governments, industry, and the academic community. Each such committee shall submit, as appropriate, to the Administrator information related to that required by paragraph (1).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Review, modification, and reissuance of criteria or information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall from time to time review, and, as appropriate, modify, and reissue any criteria or information on control techniques issued pursuant to this section. Not later than six months after August 7, 1977, the Administrator shall revise and reissue criteria relating to concentrations of NO<sup></sup><strong>2</strong> over such period (not more than three hours) as he deems appropriate. Such criteria shall include a discussion of nitric and nitrous acids, nitrites, nitrates, nitrosamines, and other carcinogenic and potentially carcinogenic derivatives of oxides of nitrogen.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Publication in Federal Register; availability of copies for general public</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The issuance of air quality criteria and information on air pollution control techniques shall be announced in the Federal Register and copies shall be made available to the general public.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Transportation planning and guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator shall, after consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, and after providing public notice and opportunity for comment, and with State and local officials, within nine months after November 15, 1990,<sup><a href="#7408_1_target" name="7408_1">1</a></sup> and periodically thereafter as necessary to maintain a continuous transportation-air quality planning process, update the June 1978 Transportation-Air Quality Planning Guidelines and publish guidance on the development and implementation of transportation and other measures necessary to demonstrate and maintain attainment of national ambient air quality standards. Such guidelines shall include information on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) methods to identify and evaluate alternative planning and control activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) methods of reviewing plans on a regular basis as conditions change or new information is presented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) identification of funds and other resources necessary to implement the plan, including interagency agreements on providing such funds and resources;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) methods to assure participation by the public in all phases of the planning process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such other methods as the Administrator determines necessary to carry out a continuous planning process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Information regarding processes, procedures, and methods to reduce or control pollutants in transportation; reduction of mobile source related pollutants; reduction of impact on public health</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Administrator shall publish and make available to appropriate Federal, State, and local environmental and transportation agencies not later than one year after November 15, 1990, and from time to time thereafter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) information prepared, as appropriate, in consultation with the Secretary of Transportation, and after providing public notice and opportunity for comment, regarding the formulation and emission reduction potential of transportation control measures related to criteria pollutants and their precursors, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) programs for improved public transit;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(xiv) programs and ordinances to facilitate non-automobile travel, provision and utilization of mass transit, and to generally reduce the need for single-occupant vehicle travel, as part of transportation planning and development efforts of a locality, including programs and ordinances applicable to new shopping centers, special events, and other centers of vehicle activity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(xv) programs for new construction and major reconstructions of paths, tracks or areas solely for the use by pedestrian or other non-motorized means of transportation when economically feasible and in the public interest. For purposes of this clause, the Administrator shall also consult with the Secretary of the Interior; and</p>
