<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10193. Identification of sites</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Guidelines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 6 months after January 7, 1983, and notwithstanding the failure of other agencies to promulgate standards pursuant to applicable law, the Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, the Director of the United States Geological Survey, the Administrator, the Council on Environmental Quality, and such other Federal agencies as the Secretary considers appropriate, is authorized to issue, pursuant to section 553 of title 5, general guidelines for the selection of a site for a test and evaluation facility. Under such guidelines the Secretary shall specify factors that qualify or disqualify a site for development as a test and evaluation facility, including factors pertaining to the location of valuable natural resources, hydrogeophysics, seismic activity, and atomic energy defense activities, proximity to water supplies, proximity to populations, the effect upon the rights of users of water, and proximity to components of the National Park System, the National Wildlife Refuge System, the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System, the National Wilderness Preservation System, or National Forest Lands. Such guidelines shall require the Secretary to consider the various geologic media in which the site for a test and evaluation facility may be located and, to the extent practicable, to identify sites in different geologic media. The Secretary shall use guidelines established under this subsection in considering and selecting sites under this subchapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Site identification by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 1 year after January 7, 1983, and following promulgation of guidelines under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary is authorized to identify 3 or more sites, at least 2 of which shall be in different geologic media in the continental United States, and at least 1 of which shall be in media other than salt. Subject to Commission requirements, the Secretary shall give preference to sites for the test and evaluation facility in media possessing geochemical characteristics that retard aqueous transport of radionuclides. In order to provide a greater possible protection of public health and safety as operating experience is gained at the test and evaluation facility, and with the exception of the primary areas under review by the Secretary on January 7, 1983, for the location of a test and evaluation facility or repository, all sites identified under this subsection shall be more than 15 statute miles from towns having a population of greater than 1,000 persons as determined by the most recent census unless such sites contain high-level radioactive waste prior to identification under this subchapter. Each identification of a site shall be supported by an environmental assessment, which shall include a detailed statement of the basis for such identification and of the probable impacts of the siting research activities planned for such site, and a discussion of alternative activities relating to siting research that may be undertaken to avoid such impacts. Such environmental assessment shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an evaluation by the Secretary as to whether such site is suitable for siting research under the guidelines established under subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an evaluation by the Secretary of the effects of the siting research activities at such site on the public health and safety and the environment;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:5747 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a reasonable comparative evaluation by the Secretary of such site with other sites and locations that have been considered;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) a description of the decision process by which such site was recommended; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) an assessment of the regional and local impacts of locating the proposed test and evaluation facility at such site.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) When the Secretary identifies a site, the Secretary shall as soon as possible notify the Governor of the State in which such site is located, or the governing body of the affected Indian tribe where such site is located, of such identification and the basis of such identification. Additional sites for the location of the test and evaluation facility authorized in section 10222(d) of this title may be identified after such 1 year period, following the same procedure as if such sites had been identified within such period.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;10197. Research and development on disposal of high-level radioactive waste</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 64 months after January 7, 1983, the Secretary is authorized to, to the extent practicable, begin at a site evaluated under section 10194 of this title, as part of and as an extension of siting research activities of such site under such section, the mining and construction of a test and evaluation facility. Prior to the mining and construction of such facility, the Secretary shall prepare an environmental assessment. The purpose of such facility shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to supplement and focus the repository site characterization process;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide the conditions under which known technological components can be integrated to demonstrate a functioning repository-like system;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to provide a means of identifying, evaluating, and resolving potential repository licensing issues that could not be resolved during the siting research program conducted under section 10192 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to validate, under actual conditions, the scientific models used in the design of a repository;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to refine the design and engineering of repository components and systems and to confirm the predicted behavior of such components and systems;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to supplement the siting data, the generic and specific geological characteristics developed under section 10194 of this title relating to isolating disposal materials in the physical environment of a repository;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) to evaluate the design concepts for packaging, handling, and emplacement of high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel at the design rate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) to establish operating capability without exposing workers to excessive radiation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Design</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall design each test and evaluation facility&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to be capable of receiving not more than 100 full-sized canisters of solidified high-level radioactive waste (which canisters shall not exceed an aggregate weight of 100 metric tons), except that spent nuclear fuel may be used instead of such waste if such waste cannot be obtained under reasonable conditions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to permit full retrieval of solidified high-level radioactive waste, or other radioactive material used by the Secretary for testing, upon completion of the technology demonstration activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) based upon the principle that the high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, or other radioactive material involved shall be isolated from the biosphere in such a way that the initial isolation is provided by engineered barriers functioning as a system with the geologic environment.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Operation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Not later than 88 months after January 7, 1983, the Secretary shall begin an in situ testing <!-- PDFPage:5749 -->program at the test and evaluation facility in accordance with the mission plan developed under section 10221 of this title, for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) conducting in situ tests of bore hole sealing, geologic media fracture sealing, and room closure to establish the techniques and performance for isolation of high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, or other radioactive materials from the biosphere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) conducting in situ tests with radioactive sources and materials to evaluate and improve reliable models for radionuclide migration, absorption, and containment within the engineered barriers and geologic media involved, if the Secretary finds there is reasonable assurance that such radioactive sources and materials will not threaten the use of such site as a repository;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) conducting in situ tests to evaluate and improve models for ground water or brine flow through fractured geologic media;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) conducting in situ tests under conditions representing the real time and the accelerated time behavior of the engineered barriers within the geologic environment involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) conducting in situ tests to evaluate the effects of heat and pressure on the geologic media involved, on the hydrology of the surrounding area, and on the integrity of the disposal packages;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) conducting in situ tests under both normal and abnormal repository conditions to establish safe design limits for disposal packages and to determine the effects of the gross release of radionuclides into surroundings, and the effects of various credible failure modes, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) seismic events leading to the coupling of aquifers through the test and evaluation facility;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) thermal pulses significantly greater than the maximum calculated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) human intrusion creating a direct pathway to the biosphere; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) conducting such other research and development activities as the Secretary considers appropriate, including such activities necessary to obtain the use of high-level radioactive waste, spent nuclear fuel, or other radioactive materials (such as any highly radioactive material from the Three Mile Island nuclear powerplant or from the West Valley Demonstration Project) for test and evaluation purposes, if such other activities are reasonably necessary to support the repository program and if there is reasonable assurance that the radioactive sources involved will not threaten the use of such site as a repository.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The in situ testing authorized in this subsection shall be designed to ensure that the suitability of the site involved for licensing by the Commission as a repository will not be adversely affected.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Use of existing Department facilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the conducting of siting research activities under section 10194 of this title and for such period thereafter as the Secretary considers appropriate, the Secretary shall use Department facilities owned by the Federal Government on January 7, 1983, for the conducting of generically applicable tests regarding packaging, handling, and emplacement technology for solidified high-level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel from civilian nuclear activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Engineered barriers</h4>
