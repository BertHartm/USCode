<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 101 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;193 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Marriage is the foundation of a successful society.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Marriage is an essential institution of a successful society which promotes the interests of children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Promotion of responsible fatherhood and motherhood is integral to successful child rearing and the well-being of children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In 1992, only 54 percent of single-parent families with children had a child support order established and, of that 54 percent, only about one-half received the full amount due. Of the cases enforced through the public child support enforcement system, only 18 percent of the caseload has a collection.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The number of individuals receiving aid to families with dependent children (in this section referred to as &lsquo;AFDC&rsquo;) has more than tripled since 1965. More than two-thirds of these recipients are children. Eighty-nine percent of children receiving AFDC benefits now live in homes in which no father is present.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A)(i) The average monthly number of children receiving AFDC benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(I) was 3,300,000 in 1965;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(II) was 6,200,000 in 1970;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(III) was 7,400,000 in 1980; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(IV) was 9,300,000 in 1992.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) While the number of children receiving AFDC benefits increased nearly threefold between 1965 and 1992, the total number of children in the United States aged 0 to 18 has declined by 5.5 percent.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1491 --><p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The Department of Health and Human Services has estimated that 12,000,000 children will receive AFDC benefits within 10 years.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) The increase in the number of children receiving public assistance is closely related to the increase in births to unmarried women. Between 1970 and 1991, the percentage of live births to unmarried women increased nearly threefold, from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The increase of out-of-wedlock pregnancies and births is well documented as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) It is estimated that the rate of nonmarital teen pregnancy rose 23 percent from 54 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried teenagers in 1976 to 66.7 pregnancies in 1991. The overall rate of nonmarital pregnancy rose 14 percent from 90.8 pregnancies per 1,000 unmarried women in 1980 to 103 in both 1991 and 1992. In contrast, the overall pregnancy rate for married couples decreased 7.3 percent between 1980 and 1991, from 126.9 pregnancies per 1,000 married women in 1980 to 117.6 pregnancies in 1991.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) The total of all out-of-wedlock births between 1970 and 1991 has risen from 10.7 percent to 29.5 percent and if the current trend continues, 50 percent of all births by the year 2015 will be out-of-wedlock.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) An effective strategy to combat teenage pregnancy must address the issue of male responsibility, including statutory rape culpability and prevention. The increase of teenage pregnancies among the youngest girls is particularly severe and is linked to predatory sexual practices by men who are significantly older.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) It is estimated that in the late 1980's, the rate for girls age 14 and under giving birth increased 26 percent.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Data indicates that at least half of the children born to teenage mothers are fathered by adult men. Available data suggests that almost 70 percent of births to teenage girls are fathered by men over age 20.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Surveys of teen mothers have revealed that a majority of such mothers have histories of sexual and physical abuse, primarily with older adult men.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The negative consequences of an out-of-wedlock birth on the mother, the child, the family, and society are well documented as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Young women 17 and under who give birth outside of marriage are more likely to go on public assistance and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled. These combined effects of &lsquo;younger and longer&rsquo; increase total AFDC costs per household by 25 percent to 30 percent for 17-year-olds.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Children born out-of-wedlock have a substantially higher risk of being born at a very low or moderately low birth weight.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Children born out-of-wedlock are more likely to experience low verbal cognitive attainment, as well as more child abuse, and neglect.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Children born out-of-wedlock were more likely to have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) Being born out-of-wedlock significantly reduces the chances of the child growing up to have an intact marriage.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) Children born out-of-wedlock are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they grow up.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Currently 35 percent of children in single-parent homes were born out-of-wedlock, nearly the same percentage as that of children in single-parent homes whose parents are divorced (37 percent). While many parents find themselves, through divorce or tragic circumstances beyond their control, facing the difficult task of raising children alone, nevertheless, the negative consequences of raising children in single-parent homes are well documented as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) Only 9 percent of married-couple families with children under 18 years of age have income below the national poverty level. In contrast, 46 percent of female-headed households with children under 18 years of age are below the national poverty level.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) Among single-parent families, nearly 1/2 of the mothers who never married received AFDC while only 1/5 of divorced mothers received AFDC.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) Children born into families receiving welfare assistance are 3 times more likely to be on welfare when they reach adulthood than children not born into families receiving welfare.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) Mothers under 20 years of age are at the greatest risk of bearing low birth weight babies.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) The younger the single-parent mother, the less likely she is to finish high school.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) Young women who have children before finishing high school are more likely to receive welfare assistance for a longer period of time.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) Between 1985 and 1990, the public cost of births to teenage mothers under the aid to families with dependent children program, the food stamp program, and the medicaid program has been estimated at $120,000,000,000.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(H) The absence of a father in the life of a child has a negative effect on school performance and peer adjustment.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(I) Children of teenage single parents have lower cognitive scores, lower educational aspirations, and a greater likelihood of becoming teenage parents themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(J) Children of single-parent homes are 3 times more likely to fail and repeat a year in grade school than are children from intact 2-parent families.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(K) Children from single-parent homes are almost 4 times more likely to be expelled or suspended from school.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(L) Neighborhoods with larger percentages of youth aged 12 through 20 and areas with higher percentages of single-parent households have higher rates of violent crime.</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(M) Of those youth held for criminal offenses within the State juvenile justice system, only 29.8 percent lived primarily in a home with both parents. In contrast to these incarcerated youth, 73.9 percent of the 62,800,000 children in the Nation's resident population were living with both parents.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Therefore, in light of this demonstration of the crisis in our Nation, it is the sense of the Congress that prevention of out-of-wedlock pregnancy and reduction in out-of-wedlock birth are very important Government interests and the policy contained in part A of title IV of the Social Security Act [this part] (as amended by section 103(a) of this Act) is intended to address the crisis.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Conduct a program, designed to serve all political subdivisions in the State (not necessarily in a uniform manner), that provides assistance to needy families with (or expecting) children and provides parents with job preparation, work, and support services to enable them to leave the program and become self-sufficient.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) Require a parent or caretaker receiving assistance under the program to engage in work (as defined by the State) once the State determines the parent or caretaker is ready to engage in work, or once the parent or caretaker has received assistance under the program for 24 months (whether or not consecutive), whichever is earlier, consistent with section 607(e)(2) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iv) Take such reasonable steps as the State deems necessary to restrict the use and disclosure of information about individuals and families receiving assistance under the program attributable to funds provided by the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(v) Establish goals and take action to prevent and reduce the incidence of out-of-wedlock pregnancies, with special emphasis on teenage pregnancies, and establish numerical goals for reducing the illegitimacy ratio of the State (as defined in section 603(a)(2)(C)(iii)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#602_1_target" name="602_1">1</a></sup> of this title) for calendar years 1996 through 2005.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(vi) Conduct a program, designed to reach State and local law enforcement officials, the education system, and relevant counseling services, that provides education and training on the problem of statutory rape so that teenage pregnancy prevention programs may be expanded in scope to include men.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) Special provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) The document shall indicate whether the State intends to treat families moving into the State from another State differently than other families under the program, and if so, how the State intends to treat such families under the program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) The document shall indicate whether the State intends to provide assistance under the program to individuals who are not citizens of the United States, and if so, shall include an overview of such assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) The document shall set forth objective criteria for the delivery of benefits and the determination of eligibility and for fair and equitable treatment, including an explanation of how the State will provide opportunities for recipients who have been adversely affected to be heard in a State administrative or appeal process.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iv) Not later than 1 year after August 22, 1996, unless the chief executive officer of the State opts out of this provision by notifying the Secretary, a State shall, consistent with the exception provided in section 607(e)(2) of this title, require a parent or caretaker receiving assistance under the program who, after receiving such assistance for 2 months is not exempt from work requirements and is not engaged in work, as determined under section 607(c) of this title, to participate in community service employment, with minimum hours per week and tasks to be determined by the State.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certification that the State will operate a child support enforcement program</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Certification of the administration of the program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certification by the chief executive officer of the State specifying which State agency or agencies will administer and supervise the program referred to in paragraph (1) for the fiscal year, which shall include assurances that local governments and private sector organizations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have been consulted regarding the plan and design of welfare services in the State so that services are provided in a manner appropriate to local populations; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have had at least 45 days to submit comments on the plan and the design of such services.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(6) Certification of standards and procedures to ensure against program fraud and abuse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A certification by the chief executive officer of the State that the State has established and is enforcing standards and procedures to ensure against program fraud and abuse, includ<!-- PDFPage:1493 -->ing standards and procedures concerning nepotism, conflicts of interest among individuals responsible for the administration and supervision of the State program, kickbacks, and the use of political patronage.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(7) Optional certification of standards and procedures to ensure that the State will screen for and identify domestic violence</h4>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(A) In general</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) refer such individuals to counseling and supportive services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) waive, pursuant to a determination of good cause, other program requirements such as time limits (for so long as necessary) for individuals receiving assistance, residency requirements, child support cooperation requirements, and family cap provisions, in cases where compliance with such requirements would make it more difficult for individuals receiving assistance under this part to escape domestic violence or unfairly penalize such individuals who are or have been victimized by such violence, or individuals who are at risk of further domestic violence.</p>
<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(B) &ldquo;Domestic violence&rdquo; defined</h4>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;Assets for Independence Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 402. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Economic well-being does not come solely from income, spending, and consumption, but also requires savings, investment, and accumulation of assets because assets can improve economic independence and stability, connect individuals with a viable and hopeful future, stimulate development of human and other capital, and enhance the welfare of offspring.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1514 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Fully 1/2 of all Americans have either no, negligible, or negative assets available for investment, just as the price of entry to the economic mainstream, the cost of a house, an adequate education, and starting a business, is increasing. Further, the household savings rate of the United States lags far behind other industrial nations, presenting a barrier to economic growth.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the current tight fiscal environment, the United States should invest existing resources in high-yield initiatives. There is reason to believe that the financial returns, including increased income, tax revenue, and decreased welfare cash assistance, resulting from individual development accounts will far exceed the cost of investment in those accounts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Traditional public assistance programs concentrating on income and consumption have rarely been successful in promoting and supporting the transition to increased economic self-sufficiency. Income-based domestic policy should be complemented with asset-based policy because, while income-based policies ensure that consumption needs (including food, child care, rent, clothing, and health care) are met, asset-based policies provide the means to achieve greater independence and economic well-being.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 403. PURPOSES.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purposes of this title are to provide for the establishment of demonstration projects designed to determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the social, civic, psychological, and economic effects of providing to individuals and families with limited means an incentive to accumulate assets by saving a portion of their earned income;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the extent to which an asset-based policy that promotes saving for postsecondary education, homeownership, and microenterprise development may be used to enable individuals and families with limited means to increase their economic self-sufficiency; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the extent to which an asset-based policy stabilizes and improves families and the community in which the families live.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 404. DEFINITIONS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In this title:</p>

<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) <cap-smallcap>Custodial accounts</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;For purposes of subparagraph (A), a custodial account shall be treated as a trust if the assets of the custodial account are held by a bank (as defined in section 408(n) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 408(n)]) or another person who demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the Secretary, that the manner in which such person will administer the custodial account will be consistent with the requirements of this title, and if the custodial account would, except for the fact that it is not a trust, constitute an individual development account described in subparagraph (A). For purposes of this title, in the case of a custodial account treated as a trust by reason of the preceding sentence, the custodian of that custodial account shall be treated as the trustee of the account.</p>

Except as provided in subsection (k) of this section, neither the Federal Government nor a State receiving funds under such programs shall discriminate against an organization which is or applies to be a contractor to provide assistance, or which accepts certificates, vouchers, or other forms of disbursement, on the basis that the organization has a religious character.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Individual described</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">An individual described in this paragraph is an individual who receives, applies for, or requests to apply for, assistance under a program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Nondiscrimination against beneficiaries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in law, a religious organization shall not discriminate against an individual in regard to rendering assistance funded under any program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section on the basis of religion, a religious belief, or refusal to actively participate in a religious practice.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fiscal accountability</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), any religious organization contracting to provide assistance funded under any program described in subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be subject to the same regulations as other contractors to account in accord with generally accepted auditing principles for the use of such funds provided under such programs.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Limited audit</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If such organization segregates Federal funds provided under such programs into separate accounts, then only the financial assistance provided with such funds shall be subject to audit.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any party which seeks to enforce its rights under this section may assert a civil action for injunctive relief exclusively in an appropriate State court against the entity or agency that allegedly commits such violation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Limitations on use of funds for certain purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds provided directly to institutions or organizations to provide services and administer programs under subsection (a)(1)(A) of this section shall be expended for sectarian worship, instruction, or proselytization.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;288, &sect;2, Sept. 28, 2006, 120 Stat. 1233, provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) For Federal fiscal year 2004, child protective services (CPS) staff nationwide reported investigating or assessing an estimated 3,000,000 allegations of child maltreatment, and determined that 872,000 children had been abused or neglected by their parents or other caregivers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Combined, the Child Welfare Services (CWS) and Promoting Safe and Stable Families (PSSF) programs provide States about $700,000,000 per year, the largest source of targeted Federal funding in the child protection system for services to ensure that children are not abused or neglected and, whenever possible, help children remain safely with their families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) A 2003 report by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported that little research is available on the effectiveness of activities supported by CWS funds&mdash;evaluations of services supported by PSSF funds have generally shown little or no effect.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Further, the Department of Health and Human Services recently completed initial Child and Family Service Reviews (CFSRs) in each State. No State was in full compliance with all measures of the CFSRs. The CFSRs also revealed that States need to work to prevent repeat abuse and neglect of children, improve services provided to families to reduce the risk of future harm (including by better monitoring the participation of families in services), and strengthen upfront services provided to families to prevent unnecessary family break-up and protect children who remain at home.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Federal policy should encourage States to invest their CWS and PSSF funds in services that promote and protect the welfare of children, support strong, healthy families, and reduce the reliance on out-of-home care, which will help ensure all children are raised in safe, loving families.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) CFSRs also found a strong correlation between frequent caseworker visits with children and positive outcomes for these children, such as timely achievement of permanency and other indicators of child well-being.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) However, a December 2005 report by the Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General found that only 20 States were able to produce reports to show whether caseworkers actually visited children in foster care on at least a monthly basis, despite the fact that nearly all States had written standards suggesting monthly visits were State policy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) A 2003 GAO report found that the average tenure for a child welfare caseworker is less than 2 years and this level of turnover negatively affects safety and permanency for children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Targeting CWS and PSSF funds to ensure children in foster care are visited on at least a monthly basis will promote better outcomes for vulnerable children, including by preventing further abuse and neglect.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) According to the Office of Applied Studies of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the annual number of new uses of Methamphetamine, also known as &lsquo;meth,&rsquo; has increased 72 percent over the past decade. According to a study conducted by the National Association of Counties which surveyed 500 county law enforcement agencies in 45 states, 88 percent of the agencies surveyed reported increases in meth related arrests starting 5 years ago.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) According to the 2004 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, nearly 12,000,000 Americans have tried methamphetamine. Meth making operations have been uncovered in all 50 states, but the most wide-spread abuse has been concentrated in the western, southwestern, and Midwestern United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Methamphetamine abuse is on the increase, particularly among women of child-bearing age. This is having an impact on child welfare systems in many States. According to a survey administered by the National Association of Counties (&lsquo;The Impact of Meth on Children&rsquo;), conducted in 300 counties in 13 states, meth is a major cause of child abuse and neglect. Forty percent of all the child welfare officials in the survey reported an increase in out-of-home placements because of meth in 2005.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) It is appropriate also to target PSSF funds to address this issue because of the unique strain the meth epidemic puts on child welfare agencies. Outcomes for children affected by meth are enhanced when services provided by law enforcement, child welfare and substance abuse agencies are integrated.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and purposes</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the period between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a parent incarcerated in a Federal or State correctional facility increased by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to approximately 2,000,000. In 1999, 2.1 percent of all children in the United States had a parent in Federal or State prison.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Prior to incarceration, 64 percent of female prisoners and 44 percent of male prisoners in State facilities lived with their children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Nearly 90 percent of the children of incarcerated fathers live with their mothers, and 79 percent of the children of incarcerated mothers live with a grandparent or other relative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Parental arrest and confinement lead to stress, trauma, stigmatization, and separation problems for children. These problems are coupled with existing problems that include poverty, violence, parental substance abuse, high-crime environments, intrafamilial abuse, child abuse and neglect, multiple care givers, and/or prior separations. As a result, these children often exhibit a broad variety of behavioral, emotional, health, and educational problems that are often compounded by the pain of separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Empirical research demonstrates that mentoring is a potent force for improving children's behavior across all risk behaviors affecting health. Quality, one-on-one relationships that provide young people with caring role models for future success have profound, life-changing potential. Done right, mentoring markedly advances youths&rsquo; life prospects. A widely cited 1995 study by Public/Private Ventures measured the impact of one Big Brothers Big Sisters program and found significant effects in the lives of youth&mdash;cutting first-time drug use by almost half and first-time alcohol use by about a third, reducing school absenteeism by half, cutting assaultive behavior by a third, improving parental and peer relationships, giving youth greater confidence in their school work, and improving academic performance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purposes of this section are to authorize the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to make competitive grants to applicants in areas with substantial numbers of children of incarcerated parents, to support the establishment or expansion and operation of programs using a network of public and private community entities to provide mentoring services for children of prisoners; and</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) State disbursement unit</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order for a State to meet the requirements of this section, the State agency must establish and operate a unit (which shall be known as the &ldquo;State disbursement unit&rdquo;) for the collection and disbursement of payments under support orders&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in all cases being enforced by the State pursuant to section 654(4) of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) in all cases not being enforced by the State under this part in which the support order is initially issued in the State on or after January 1, 1994, and in which the income of the noncustodial parent is subject to withholding pursuant to section 666(a)(8)(B) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Operation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State disbursement unit shall be operated&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) directly by the State agency (or 2 or more State agencies under a regional cooperative agreement), or (to the extent appropriate) by a contractor responsible directly to the State agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) except in cases described in paragraph (1)(B), in coordination with the automated system established by the State pursuant to section 654a of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Linking of local disbursement units</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State disbursement unit may be established by linking local disbursement units through an automated information network, subject to this section, if the Secretary agrees that the system will not cost more nor take more time to establish or operate than a centralized system. In addition, employers shall be given 1 location to which income withholding is sent.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1621 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Required procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The State disbursement unit shall use automated procedures, electronic processes, and computer-driven technology to the maximum extent feasible, efficient, and economical, for the collection and disbursement of support payments, including procedures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) for receipt of payments from parents, employers, and other States, and for disbursements to custodial parents and other obligees, the State agency, and the agencies of other States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) for accurate identification of payments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to ensure prompt disbursement of the custodial parent's share of any payment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to furnish to any parent, upon request, timely information on the current status of support payments under an order requiring payments to be made by or to the parent, except that in cases described in subsection (a)(1)(B) of this section, the State disbursement unit shall not be required to convert and maintain in automated form records of payments kept pursuant to section 666(a)(8)(B)(iii) of this title before the effective date of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Timing of disbursements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in paragraph (2), the State disbursement unit shall distribute all amounts payable under section 657(a) of this title within 2 business days after receipt from the employer or other source of periodic income, if sufficient information identifying the payee is provided. The date of collection for amounts collected and distributed under this part is the date of receipt by the State disbursement unit, except that if current support is withheld by an employer in the month when due and is received by the State disbursement unit in a month other than the month when due, the date of withholding may be deemed to be the date of collection.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Permissive retention of arrearages</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The State disbursement unit may delay the distribution of collections toward arrearages until the resolution of any timely appeal with respect to such arrearages.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Business day&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this section, the term &ldquo;business day&rdquo; means a day on which State offices are open for regular business.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;664. Collection of past-due support from Federal tax refunds</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Procedures applicable; distribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Upon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support which has been assigned to such State pursuant to section 608(a)(3) or section 671(a)(17) of this title, the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual). If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall withhold from such refunds an amount equal to the past-due support, shall concurrently send notice to such individual that the withholding has been made (including in or with such notice a notification to any other person who may have filed a joint return with such individual of the steps which such other person may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the refund), and shall pay such amount to the State agency (together with notice of the individual's home address) for distribution in accordance with section 657 of this title. This subsection may be executed by the disbursing official of the Department of the Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Upon receiving notice from a State agency administering a plan approved under this part that a named individual owes past-due support which such State has agreed to collect under section 654(4)(A)(ii) of this title, and that the State agency has sent notice to such individual in accordance with paragraph (3)(A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall determine whether any amounts, as refunds of Federal taxes paid, are payable to such individual (regardless of whether such individual filed a tax return as a married or unmarried individual). If the Secretary of the Treasury finds that any such amount is payable, he shall withhold from such refunds an amount equal to such past-due support, and shall concurrently send notice to such individual that the withholding has been made, including in or with such notice a notification to any other person who may have filed a joint return with such individual of the steps which such other person may take in order to secure his or her proper share of the refund. The Secretary of the Treasury shall pay the amount withheld to the State agency, and the State shall pay to the Secretary of the Treasury any fee imposed by the Secretary of the Treasury to cover the costs of the withholding and any required notification. The State agency shall, subject to paragraph (3)(B), distribute such amount to or on behalf of the child to whom the support was owed in accordance with section 657 of this title. This subsection may be executed by the Secretary of the Department of the Treasury or his designee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) This paragraph shall apply only with respect to refunds payable under section 6402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 after December 31, 1985.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Prior to notifying the Secretary of the Treasury under paragraph (1) or (2) that an individual owes past-due support, the State shall send notice to such individual that a withholding will be made from any refund otherwise payable to such individual. The notice shall also (i) instruct the individual owing the past-due support of the steps which may be taken to contest the State's determination that past-due support is owed or the amount of the past-due support, and (ii) provide information, as may be prescribed by the Secretary of Health and Human Services by regulation in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, with respect to procedures to be followed, in the case of a joint return, to protect the share of the refund which may be payable to another person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that an amount should be withheld under paragraph (1) or (2), and that the refund from which it should be withheld is based upon a joint return, the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the State that the withholding is being made from a refund based upon a joint return, and shall furnish to the State the names and addresses of each taxpayer filing such joint return. In the case of a withholding under paragraph (2), the State may delay distribution of the amount withheld until the State has been notified by the Secretary of the Treasury that the other person filing the joint return has received his or her proper share of the refund, but such delay may not exceed six months.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1646 --><p class="statutory-body">(C) If the other person filing the joint return with the named individual owing the past-due support takes appropriate action to secure his or her proper share of a refund from which a withholding was made under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary of the Treasury shall pay such share to such other person. The Secretary of the Treasury shall deduct the amount of such payment from amounts subsequently payable to the State agency to which the amount originally withheld from such refund was paid.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In any case in which an amount was withheld under paragraph (1) or (2) and paid to a State, and the State subsequently determines that the amount certified as past-due support was in excess of the amount actually owed at the time the amount withheld is to be distributed to or on behalf of the child, the State shall pay the excess amount withheld to the named individual thought to have owed the past-due support (or, in the case of amounts withheld on the basis of a joint return, jointly to the parties filing such return).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regulations; contents, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary of the Treasury shall issue regulations, approved by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, prescribing the time or times at which States must submit notices of past-due support, the manner in which such notices must be submitted, and the necessary information that must be contained in or accompany the notices. The regulations shall be consistent with the provisions of subsection (a)(3) of this section, shall specify the minimum amount of past-due support to which the offset procedure established by subsection (a) of this section may be applied, and the fee that a State must pay to reimburse the Secretary of the Treasury for the full cost of applying the offset procedure, and shall provide that the Secretary of the Treasury will advise the Secretary of Health and Human Services, not less frequently than annually, of the States which have furnished notices of past-due support under subsection (a) of this section, the number of cases in each State with respect to which such notices have been furnished, the amount of support sought to be collected under this subsection by each State, and the amount of such collections actually made in the case of each State. Any fee paid to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection may be used to reimburse appropriations which bore all or part of the cost of applying such procedure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of withholdings made under subsection (a)(2) of this section, the regulations promulgated pursuant to this subsection shall include the following requirements:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The withholding shall apply only in the case where the State determines that the amount of the past-due support which will be owed at the time the withholding is to be made, based upon the pattern of payment of support and other enforcement actions being pursued to collect the past-due support, is equal to or greater than $500. The State may limit the $500 threshold amount to amounts of past-due support accrued since the time that the State first began to enforce the child support order involved under the State plan, and may limit the application of the withholding to past-due support accrued since such time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The fee which the Secretary of the Treasury may impose to cover the costs of the withholding and notification may not exceed $25 per case submitted.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) &ldquo;Past-due support&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this part the term &ldquo;past-due support&rdquo; means the amount of a delinquency, determined under a court order, or an order of an administrative process established under State law, for support and maintenance of a child (whether or not a minor), or of a child (whether or not a minor) and the parent with whom the child is living.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Mandatory allotment; notice upon failure to make; amount of allotment; adjustment or discontinuance; consultation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In any case in which child support payments or child and spousal support payments are owed by a member of one of the uniformed services (as defined in section 101(3) of title 37) on active duty, such member shall be required to make allotments from his pay and allowances (under chapter 13 of title 37) as payment of such support, when he has failed to make periodic payments under a support order that meets the criteria specified in section 1673(b)(1)(A) of title 15 and the resulting delinquency in such payments is in a total amount equal to the support payable for two months or longer. Failure to make such payments shall be established by notice from an authorized person (as defined in subsection (b) of this section) to the designated official in the appropriate uniformed service. Such notice (which shall in turn be given to the affected member) shall also specify the person to whom the allotment is to be payable. The amount of the allotment shall be the amount necessary to comply with the order (which, if the order so provides, may include arrearages as well as amounts for current support), except that the amount of the allotment, together with any other amounts withheld for support from the wages of the member, as a percentage of his pay from the uniformed service, shall not exceed the limits prescribed in sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#665_1_target" name="665_1">1</a></sup> 1673(b) and (c) of title 15. An allotment under this subsection shall be adjusted or discontinued upon notice from the authorized person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, no action shall be taken to require an allotment from the pay and allowances of any member of one of the uniformed services under such provisions (A) until such member has had a consultation with a judge advocate of the service involved (as defined in section 801(13) of title 10), or with a judge advocate (as defined in section 801(11)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#665_2_target" name="665_2">2</a></sup> of such title) in the case of the Coast Guard, or with a legal officer designated by the Secretary concerned (as defined in section 101(5) of title 37) in any other case, in person, to discuss the legal and other factors involved with respect to the member's support obligation and his failure to make payments thereon, or (B) until 30 days have elapsed after the notice described in the second sentence of paragraph (1) is given to the affected member in any case where it has not been possible, despite continuing good faith efforts, to arrange such a consultation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) &ldquo;Authorized person&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section the term &ldquo;authorized person&rdquo; with respect to any member of the uniformed services means&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;666. Requirement of statutorily prescribed procedures to improve effectiveness of child support enforcement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Types of procedures required</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to satisfy section 654(20)(A) of this title, each State must have in effect laws requiring the use of the following procedures, consistent with this section and with regulations of the Secretary, to increase the effectiveness of the program which the State administers under this part:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) Procedures described in subsection (b) of this section for the withholding from income of amounts payable as support in cases subject to enforcement under the State plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Procedures under which the income of a person with a support obligation imposed by a support order issued (or modified) in the State before January 1, 1994, if not otherwise subject to withholding under subsection (b) of this section, shall become subject to withholding as provided in subsection (b) of this section if arrearages occur, without the need for a judicial or administrative hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Expedited administrative and judicial procedures (including the procedures specified in subsection (c) of this section) for establishing paternity and for establishing, modifying, and enforcing support obligations. The Secretary may waive the provisions of this paragraph with respect to one or more political subdivisions within the State on the basis of the effectiveness and timeliness of support order issuance and enforcement or paternity establishment within the political subdivision (in accordance with the general rule for exemptions under subsection (d) of this section).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Procedures under which the State child support enforcement agency shall request, and the State shall provide, that for the purpose of enforcing a support order under any State plan approved under this part&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) any refund of State income tax which would otherwise be payable to a noncustodial parent will be reduced, after notice has been sent to that noncustodial parent of the proposed reduction and the procedures to be followed to contest it (and after full compliance with all procedural due process requirements of the State), by the amount of any overdue support owed by such noncustodial parent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount by which such refund is reduced shall be distributed in accordance with section 657 of this title in the case of overdue support assigned to a State pursuant to section 608(a)(3) or 671(a)(17) of this title, or, in any other case, shall be distributed, after deduction of any fees imposed by the State to cover the costs of collection, to the child or parent to whom such support is owed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) notice of the noncustodial parent's social security account number (or numbers, if he has more than one such number) and home address shall be furnished to the State agency requesting the refund offset, and to the State agency enforcing the order.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The income of a noncustodial parent shall become subject to such withholding, in the case of income not subject to withholding under subparagraph (A), on the date on which the payments which the noncustodial parent has failed to make under a support order are at least equal to the support payable for one month or, if earlier, and without regard to whether there is an arrearage, the earliest of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A)(i) The employer of any noncustodial parent to whom paragraph (1) applies, upon being given notice as described in clause (ii), must be required to withhold from such noncustodial parent's income the amount specified by such notice (which may include a fee, established by the State, to be paid to the employer unless waived by such employer) and pay such amount (after deducting and retaining any portion thereof which represents the fee so established) to the State disbursement unit within 7 business days after the date the amount would (but for this subsection) have been paid or credited to the employee, for distribution in accordance with this part. The employer shall withhold funds as directed in the notice, except that when an employer receives an income withholding order issued by another State, the employer shall apply the income withholding law of the State of the obligor's principal place of employment in determining&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Provision must be made for the imposition of a fine against any employer who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) discharges from employment, refuses to employ, or takes disciplinary action against any noncustodial parent subject to income withholding required by this subsection because of the existence of such withholding and the obligations or additional obligations which it imposes upon the employer; or</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;314, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1266, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 2000&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a crucial and essential role in the Nation's child welfare system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for abused and neglected children under the supervision of that system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105&ndash;89; 111 Stat. 2115) [see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1305 of this title] establishes explicitly for the first time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be the paramount consideration when any decision is made regarding a child in the Nation's child welfare system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by requiring timely decisionmaking in proceedings to determine whether children can safely return to their families or whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the foster care system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 specifically requires, among other things, that States move to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) While essential to protect children and to carry out the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that Act increase the pressure on the Nation's already overburdened abuse and neglect courts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially improved by the acquisition and implementation of computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe and stable families. Such systems could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by the identification and implementation of projects designed to eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing caseloads.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further strengthened by improving the quality and availability of training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who represent the children and the parents of children in abuse and neglect proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this country are already committed to the quality administration of justice, the performance of such courts would be even further enhanced by the development of models and educational opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, case management, representation of children, automated interagency interfaces, and &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run efficiently and effectively. The performance of those individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange ideas with their peers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and ears of abuse and neglect courts in proceedings conducted by, or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court system. The Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit from an expansion of this program to currently underserved communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by reducing the average length of an abused and neglected child's stay in foster care, improving the quality of decision-making and court services provided to children and families, and increasing the number of adoptions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, (A) no payment may be made to parents with respect to any child who has attained the age of eighteen (or, where the State determines that the child has a mental or physical handicap which warrants the continuation of assistance, the age of twenty-one), and (B) no payment may be made to parents with respect to any child if the State determines that the parents are no longer legally responsible for the support of the child or if the State determines that the child is no longer receiving any support from such parents. Parents who have been receiving adoption assistance payments under this section shall keep the State or local agency administering the program under this section informed of circumstances which would, pursuant to this subsection, make them ineligible for such assistance payments, or eligible for assistance payments in a different amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this part, individuals with whom a child (who has been determined by the State, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, to be a child with special needs) is placed for adoption in accordance with applicable State and local law shall be eligible for such payments, during the period of the placement, on the same terms and subject to the same conditions as if such individuals had adopted such child.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) For purposes of paragraph (1)(B)(i), the term &ldquo;nonrecurring adoption expenses&rdquo; means reasonable and necessary adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of a child with special needs and which are not incurred in violation of State or Federal law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A State's payment of nonrecurring adoption expenses under an adoption assistance agreement shall be treated as an expenditure made for the proper and efficient administration of the State plan for purposes of section 674(a)(3)(E) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Aid for dependent children; assistance for minor children in needy families</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For purposes of subchapter XIX of this chapter, any child who is described in paragraph (3) is deemed to be a dependent child as defined in section 606 of this title (as in effect as of July 16, 1996) and deemed to be a recipient of aid to families with dependent children under part A of this subchapter (as so in effect) in the State where such child resides.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of subchapter XX of this chapter, any child who is described in paragraph (3) is deemed to be a minor child in a needy family under a State program funded under part A of this subchapter and deemed to be a recipient of assistance under such part.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are being made under section 672 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For purposes of paragraphs (1) and (2), a child whose costs in a foster family home or child-care institution are covered by the foster care maintenance payments being made with respect to the child's minor parent, as provided in section 675(4)(B) of this title, shall be considered a child with respect to whom foster care maintenance payments are being made under section 672 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Children with special needs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a child shall not be considered a child with special needs unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the State has determined that the child cannot or should not be returned to the home of his parents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the State had first determined (A) that there exists with respect to the child a specific factor or condition (such as his ethnic background, age, or membership in a minority or sibling group, or the presence of factors such as medical conditions or physical, mental, or emotional handicaps) because of which it is reasonable to conclude that such child cannot be placed with adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter, and (B) that, except where it would be against the best interests of the child because of such factors as the existence of significant emotional ties with prospective adoptive parents while in the care of such parents as a foster child, a reasonable, but unsuccessful, effort has been made to place the child with appropriate adoptive parents without providing adoption assistance under this section or medical assistance under subchapter XIX of this chapter.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) In 1997, the Congress passed the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 [Pub. L. 105&ndash;89; see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1305 of this title] to promote comprehensive child welfare reform to ensure that consideration of children's safety is paramount in child welfare decisions, and to provide a greater sense of urgency to find every child a safe, permanent home.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 also created the Adoption Incentives program, which authorizes incentive payments to States to promote adoptions, with additional incentives provided for the adoption of foster children with special needs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Since 1997, all States, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico have qualified for incentive payments for their work in promoting adoption of foster children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Between 1997 and 2002, adoptions increased by 64 percent, and adoptions of children with special needs increased by 63 percent; however, 542,000 children remain in foster care, and 126,000 are eligible for adoption.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Although substantial progress has been made to promote adoptions, attention should be focused on promoting adoption of older children. Recent data suggest that half of the children waiting to be adopted are age 9 or older.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) at the option of the State, the child is being cared for by a relative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) a State agency has documented in the case plan (which shall be available for court review) a compelling reason for determining that filing such a petition would not be in the best interests of the child; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this section is to provide States with flexible funding that will enable programs to be designed and conducted&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to identify children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age and to help these children make the transition to self-sufficiency by providing services such as assistance in obtaining a high school diploma, career exploration, vocational training, job placement and retention, training in daily living skills, training in budgeting and financial management skills, substance abuse prevention, and preventive health activities (including smoking avoidance, nutrition education, and pregnancy prevention);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to help children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age receive the education, training, and services necessary to obtain employment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to help children who are likely to remain in foster care until 18 years of age prepare for and enter postsecondary training and education institutions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to provide personal and emotional support to children aging out of foster care, through mentors and the promotion of interactions with dedicated adults;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) to provide financial, housing, counseling, employment, education, and other appropriate support and services to former foster care recipients between 18 and 21 years of age to complement their own efforts to achieve self-sufficiency and to assure that program participants recognize and accept their personal responsibility for preparing for and then making the transition from adolescence to adulthood; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) to make available vouchers for education and training, including postsecondary training and education, to youths who have aged out of foster care.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Applications</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A State may apply for funds from its allotment under subsection (c) of this section for a <!-- PDFPage:1694 -->period of five consecutive fiscal years by submitting to the Secretary, in writing, a plan that meets the requirements of paragraph (2) and the certifications required by paragraph (3) with respect to the plan.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) State plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A plan meets the requirements of this paragraph if the plan specifies which State agency or agencies will administer, supervise, or oversee the programs carried out under the plan, and describes how the State intends to do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Design and deliver programs to achieve the purposes of this section.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) States are required to make reasonable efforts to find adoptive families for all children, including older children, for whom reunification with their biological family is not in the best interests of the child. However, some older children will continue to live in foster care.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Congress has received extensive information that adolescents leaving foster care have significant difficulty making a successful transition to adulthood; this information shows that children aging out of foster care show high rates of homelessness, non-marital childbearing, poverty, and delinquent or criminal behavior; they are also frequently the target of crime and physical assaults.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Nation's State and local governments, with financial support from the Federal Government, should offer an extensive program of education, training, employment, and financial support for young adults leaving foster care, with participation in such program beginning several years before high school graduation and continuing, as needed, until the young adults emancipated from foster care establish independence or reach 21 years of age.&rdquo;</p>
