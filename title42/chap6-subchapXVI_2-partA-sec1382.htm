<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Period for determination of benefits</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) An individual's eligibility for a benefit under this subchapter for a month shall be determined on the basis of the individual's (and eligible spouse's, if any) income, resources, and other relevant characteristics in such month, and, except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), (4), (5), and (6), the amount of such benefit shall be determined for such month on the basis of income and other characteristics in the first or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, second month preceding such month. Eligibility for and the amount of such benefits shall be redetermined at such time or times as may be provided by the Commissioner of Social Security.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of such benefit for the month in which an application for benefits becomes effective (or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, for such month and the following month) and for any month immediately following a month of ineligibility for such benefits (or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, for such month and the following month) shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be determined on the basis of the income of the individual and the eligible spouse, if any, of such individual and other relevant circumstances in such month; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of the month in which an application becomes effective or the first month <!-- PDFPage:1474 -->following a period of ineligibility, if such application becomes effective, or eligibility is restored, after the first day of such month, bear the same ratio to the amount of the benefit which would have been payable to such individual if such application had become effective, or eligibility had been restored, on the first day of such month as the number of days in such month including and following the effective date of such application or restoration of eligibility bears to the total number of days in such month.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this subsection, an increase in the benefit amount payable under subchapter II of this chapter (over the amount payable in the preceding month, or, at the election of the Commissioner of Social Security, the second preceding month) to an individual receiving benefits under this subchapter shall be included in the income used to determine the benefit under this subchapter of such individual for any month which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the first month in which the benefit amount payable to such individual under this title is increased pursuant to section 1382f of this title, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) at the election of the Commissioner of Social Security, the month immediately following such month.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (3), if the Commissioner of Social Security determines that reliable information is currently available with respect to the income and other circumstances of an individual for a month (including information with respect to a class of which such individual is a member and information with respect to scheduled cost-of-living adjustments under other benefit programs), the benefit amount of such individual under this subchapter for such month may be determined on the basis of such information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Commissioner of Social Security shall prescribe by regulation the circumstances in which information with respect to an event may be taken into account pursuant to subparagraph (A) in determining benefit amounts under this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding paragraphs (1) and (2), any income which is paid to or on behalf of an individual in any month pursuant to (A) a State plan approved under part A of subchapter IV of this chapter (relating to aid to families with dependent children), (B) section 672 of this title (relating to foster care assistance), (C) section 1522(e) of title 8 (relating to assistance for refugees), (D) section 501(a) of Public Law 96-422 (relating to assistance for Cuban and Haitian entrants), or (E) section 13 of title 25 (relating to assistance furnished by the Bureau of Indian Affairs), shall be taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit under this subchapter of such individual (and his eligible spouse, if any) only for that month, and shall not be taken into account in determining the amount of the benefit for any other month.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The dollar amount in effect under subsection (b) of this section as a result of any increase in benefits under this subchapter by reason of section 1382f of this title shall be used to determine the value of any in-kind support and maintenance required to be taken into account in determining the benefit payable under this subchapter to an individual (and the eligible spouse, if any, of the individual) for the 1st 2 months for which the increase in benefits applies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) For purposes of this subsection, an application of an individual for benefits under this subchapter shall be effective on the later of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the date such application is filed, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the date such individual first becomes eligible for such benefits with respect to such application.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Commissioner of Social Security may waive the limitations specified in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of subsection (e)(1) of this section on an individual's eligibility and benefit amount for a month (to the extent either such limitation is applicable by reason of such individual's presence throughout such month in a hospital, extended care facility, nursing home, or intermediate care facility) if such waiver would promote the individual's removal from such institution or facility. Upon waiver of such limitations, the Commissioner of Social Security shall apply, to the month preceding the month of removal, or, if the Commissioner of Social Security so determines, the two months preceding the month of removal, the benefit rate that is appropriate to such individual's living arrangement subsequent to his removal from such institution or facility.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on amount of gross income earned; &ldquo;gross income&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Commissioner of Social Security may prescribe the circumstances under which, consistently with the purposes of this subchapter, the gross income from a trade or business (including farming) will be considered sufficiently large to make an individual ineligible for benefits under this subchapter.

<p class="statutory-body-block">The benefit of any person under this subchapter (including State supplementation if any) for each month to which this subparagraph applies shall be payable, without interruption of benefit payments and on the date the benefit involved is regularly due, at the rate that was applicable to such person in the month prior to the first month throughout which he or she is in the institution or facility.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) An individual who is not in compliance with this paragraph for 12 consecutive months shall not be eligible for supplemental security income benefits under this subchapter. The preceding sentence shall not be construed to prevent the individual from reapplying and becoming eligible for such benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v)(I) In the case of any individual eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability, if&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the individual shall not be eligible for such benefits by reason of disability for any month following such 36-month period if, in such following month, alcoholism or drug addiction would be a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled, notwithstanding section 1382h(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) An individual whose entitlement to benefits under subchapter II of this chapter based on disability has been terminated by reason of section 425(c)(7) of this title shall not be eligible for benefits under this subchapter by reason of disability, if alcoholism or drug addiction is a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled, for any month after the individual's termination month (within the meaning of section 423(a)(1) of this title or subsection (d)(1)(G)(i), (e)(1), or (f)(1) of section 402 of this title, as applicable) with respect to such benefits.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(vi)(I) In the case of any individual who is eligible for benefits under this subchapter for any month solely by reason of disability, if alcoholism or drug addiction is a contributing factor material to the Commissioner's determination that the individual is disabled, payment of any benefits under this subchapter the payment of which is past due shall be made in any month only to the extent that the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(aa) the amount of the past-due benefit paid in the month; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(III) Upon the death of an individual to whom payment of past-due benefits has been limited under subclause (I), any amount of such past-due benefits remaining unpaid shall be treated as an underpayment for purposes of section 1383(b)(1)(A) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the criteria being used by the Commissioner of Social Security in determining when a husband and wife are to be considered two eligible individuals for purposes of this subchapter and when they are to be considered an eligible individual with an eligible spouse, the State agency administering or supervising the administration of a State plan under any other program under this chapter may (in the administration of such plan) treat a husband and wife living in the same hospital, home, or facility described in paragraph (1)(B) as though they were an eligible individual with his or her eligible spouse for purposes of this subchapter (rather than two eligible individuals), after they have continuously lived in the same such hospital, home, or facility for 6 months, if treating such husband and wife as two eligible individuals would prevent either of them from receiving benefits or assistance under such plan or reduce the amount thereof.</p>
