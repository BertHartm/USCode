<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is established as an independent agency within the executive branch a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (referred to in this section as the &ldquo;Board&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Consistent with the report of the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States, Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) In conducting the war on terrorism, the Government may need additional powers and may need to enhance the use of its existing powers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) This shift of power and authority to the Government calls for an enhanced system of checks and balances to protect the precious liberties that are vital to our way of life and to ensure that the Government uses its powers for the purposes for which the powers were given.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States correctly concluded that &ldquo;The choice between security and liberty is a false choice, as nothing is more likely to endanger America's liberties than the success of a terrorist attack at home. Our history has shown us that insecurity threatens liberty. Yet, if our liberties are curtailed, we lose the values that we are struggling to defend.&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Board shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) analyze and review actions the executive branch takes to protect the Nation from terrorism, ensuring that the need for such actions is balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) review the implementation of new and existing legislation, regulations, and policies related to efforts to protect the Nation from terrorism, including the implementation of information sharing guidelines under subsections (d) and (f) of section 485 of title 6;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) advise the President and the departments, agencies, and elements of the executive branch to ensure that privacy and civil liberties are appropriately considered in the development and implementation of such legislation, regulations, policies, and guidelines; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) in providing advice on proposals to retain or enhance a particular governmental power, consider whether the department, agency, or element of the executive branch has established&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) that the need for the power is balanced with the need to protect privacy and civil liberties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) that there is adequate supervision of the use by the executive branch of the power to ensure protection of privacy and civil liberties; and</p>
