<p class="statutory-body">Whenever (a) a court has authorized the appointment of examiners pursuant to the provisions of section 1973a(a) of this title, or (b) unless a declaratory judgment has been rendered under section 1973b(a) of this title, the Attorney General certifies with respect to any political subdivision named in, or included within the scope of, determinations made under section 1973b(b) of this title that (1) he has received complaints in writing from twenty or more residents of such political subdivision alleging that they have been denied the right to vote under color of law on account of race or color, or in contravention of the guarantees set forth in section 1973b(f)(2) of this title, and that he believes such complaints to be meritorious, or (2) that in his judgment (considering, among other factors, whether the ratio of nonwhite persons to white persons registered to vote within such subdivision appears to him to be reasonably attributable to violations of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment or whether substantial evidence exists that bona fide efforts are being made within such subdivision to comply with the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment), the appointment of examiners is otherwise necessary to enforce the guarantees of the fourteenth or fifteenth amendment, the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall appoint as many examiners for such subdivision as the Director may deem appropriate to prepare and maintain lists of persons eligible to vote in Federal, State, and local elections. Such examiners, hearing officers provided for in section 1973g(a) of this title and other persons deemed necessary by the Director to carry out the provisions and purposes of subchapters I&ndash;A to I&ndash;C of this chapter shall be appointed, compensated, and separated without regard to the provisions of any statute administered by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and service under subchapters I&ndash;A to I&ndash;C of this chapter shall not be considered employment for the purposes of any statute administered by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, except the provisions of subchapter III of chapter 73 of title 5 relating to political activities: <em>Provided</em>, That the Director is authorized, after consulting the head of the appropriate department or agency, to designate suitable persons in the official service of the United States, with their consent, to serve in these positions. Examiners and hearing officers shall have the power to administer oaths.</p>
