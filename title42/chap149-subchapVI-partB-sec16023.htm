<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) continue appropriate activities under paragraphs (1) through (5) of subsection (a);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) develop, through a competitive process, a final design for the prototype nuclear reactor and plant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) apply for licenses to construct and operate the prototype nuclear reactor from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) construct and start up operations of the prototype nuclear reactor and its associated hydrogen or electricity production facilities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Project requirements</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary shall ensure that the Project is structured so as to maximize the technical interchange and transfer of technologies and ideas into the Project from other sources of relevant expertise, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the nuclear power industry, including nuclear powerplant construction firms, particularly with respect to issues associated with plant design, construction, and operational and safety issues;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the chemical processing industry, particularly with respect to issues relating to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the use of process energy for production of hydrogen; and</p>
