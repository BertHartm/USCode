<h4 class="note-head">Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 106&ndash;314, Oct. 17, 2000, 114 Stat. 1266, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Strengthening Abuse and Neglect Courts Act of 2000&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Under both Federal and State law, the courts play a crucial and essential role in the Nation's child welfare system and in ensuring safety, stability, and permanence for abused and neglected children under the supervision of that system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 (Public Law 105&ndash;89; 111 Stat. 2115) [see Short Title of 1997 Amendment note set out under section 1305 of this title] establishes explicitly for the first time in Federal law that a child's health and safety must be the paramount consideration when any decision is made regarding a child in the Nation's child welfare system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 promotes stability and permanence for abused and neglected children by requiring timely decisionmaking in proceedings to determine whether children can safely return to their families or whether they should be moved into safe and stable adoptive homes or other permanent family arrangements outside the foster care system.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) To avoid unnecessary and lengthy stays in the foster care system, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 specifically requires, among other things, that States move to terminate the parental rights of the parents of those children who have been in foster care for 15 of the last 22 months.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) While essential to protect children and to carry out the general purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997, the accelerated timelines for the termination of parental rights and the other requirements imposed under that Act increase the pressure on the Nation's already overburdened abuse and neglect courts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be substantially improved by the acquisition and implementation of computerized case-tracking systems to identify and eliminate existing backlogs, to move abuse and neglect caseloads forward in a timely manner, and to move children into safe and stable families. Such systems could also be used to evaluate the effectiveness of such courts in meeting the purposes of the amendments made by, and provisions of, the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would also be improved by the identification and implementation of projects designed to eliminate the backlog of abuse and neglect cases, including the temporary hiring of additional judges, extension of court hours, and other projects designed to reduce existing caseloads.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The administrative efficiency and effectiveness of the Nation's abuse and neglect courts would be further strengthened by improving the quality and availability of training for judges, court personnel, agency attorneys, guardians ad litem, volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs, and attorneys who represent the children and the parents of children in abuse and neglect proceedings.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) While recognizing that abuse and neglect courts in this country are already committed to the quality administration of justice, the performance of such courts would be even further enhanced by the development of models and educational opportunities that reinforce court projects that have already been developed, including models for case-flow procedures, case management, representation of children, automated interagency interfaces, and &lsquo;best practices&rsquo; standards.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Judges, magistrates, commissioners, and other judicial officers play a central and vital role in ensuring that proceedings in our Nation's abuse and neglect courts are run efficiently and effectively. The performance of those individuals in such courts can only be further enhanced by training, seminars, and an ongoing opportunity to exchange ideas with their peers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Volunteers who participate in court-appointed special advocate (CASA) programs play a vital role as the eyes and ears of abuse and neglect courts in pro<!-- PDFPage:1680 -->ceedings conducted by, or under the supervision of, such courts and also bring increased public scrutiny of the abuse and neglect court system. The Nation's abuse and neglect courts would benefit from an expansion of this program to currently underserved communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Improved computerized case-tracking systems, comprehensive training, and development of, and education on, model abuse and neglect court systems, particularly with respect to underserved areas, would significantly further the purposes of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 by reducing the average length of an abused and neglected child's stay in foster care, improving the quality of decision-making and court services provided to children and families, and increasing the number of adoptions.</p>
