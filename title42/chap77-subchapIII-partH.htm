<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Department of Energy program</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Beginning in the fiscal year ending September 30, 1990, the Secretary shall ensure, with the <!-- PDFPage:5910 -->cooperation of other appropriate agencies and consistent with other Federal law, that the maximum number practicable of the vehicles acquired annually for use by the Federal Government shall be alternative fueled vehicles. In no event shall the number of such vehicles acquired be less than the number required under section 13212 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any determination of whether the acquisition of a vehicle is practicable under paragraph (1), the initial cost of such vehicle to the United States shall not be considered as a factor unless the initial cost of such vehicle exceeds the initial cost of a comparable gasoline or diesel fueled vehicle by at least 5 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) To the extent practicable, the Secretary shall acquire both dedicated and dual fueled vehicles, and shall ensure that each type of alternative fueled vehicle is used by the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Vehicles acquired under this section shall be acquired from original equipment manufacturers. If such vehicles are not available from original equipment manufacturers, vehicles converted to use alternative fuels may be acquired if, after conversion, the original equipment manufacturer's warranty continues to apply to such vehicles, pursuant to an agreement between the original equipment manufacturer and the person performing the conversion. This subparagraph shall not apply to vehicles acquired by the United States Postal Service pursuant to a contract entered into by the United States Postal Service before October 24, 1992, and which terminates on or before December 31, 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Alternative fueled vehicles, other than those described in subparagraph (B), may be acquired solely for the purposes of studies under subsection (b) of this section, whether or not original equipment manufacturer warranties still apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In deciding which types of alternative fueled vehicles to acquire in implementing this part, the Secretary shall consider as a factor&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) which types of vehicles yield the greatest reduction in pollutants emitted per dollar spent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the source of the fuel to supply the vehicles, giving preference to vehicles that operate on alternative fuels derived from domestic sources.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) Dual fueled vehicles acquired pursuant to this section shall be operated on alternative fuels unless the Secretary determines that an agency qualifies for a waiver of such requirement for vehicles operated by the agency in a particular geographic area in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the alternative fuel otherwise required to be used in the vehicle is not reasonably available to retail purchasers of the fuel, as certified to the Secretary by the head of the agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the cost of the alternative fuel otherwise required to be used in the vehicle is unreasonably more expensive compared to gasoline, as certified to the Secretary by the head of the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Secretary shall monitor compliance with this subparagraph by all such fleets and shall report annually to Congress on the extent to which the requirements of this subparagraph are being achieved. The report shall include information on annual reductions achieved from the use of petroleum-based fuels and the problems, if any, encountered in acquiring alternative fuels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) At least 50 percent of the alternative fuels used in vehicles acquired pursuant to this section shall be derived from domestic feedstocks, except to the extent inconsistent with the multilateral trade agreements (as defined in section 3501(4) of title 19). The Secretary shall issue regulations to implement this requirement. For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;domestic&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 13211(7) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) Except to the extent inconsistent with the multilateral trade agreements (as defined in section 3501(4) of title 19), vehicles acquired under this section shall be motor vehicles manufactured in the United States or Canada.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Acquisitions of vehicles under this section shall, to the extent practicable, be coordinated with acquisitions of alternative fueled vehicles by State and local governments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Studies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Secretary, in cooperation with the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, shall conduct a study of a representative sample of alternative fueled vehicles in Federal fleets, which shall at a minimum address&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the performance of such vehicles, including performance in cold weather and at high altitude;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the fuel economy, safety, and emissions of such vehicles; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) a comparison of the operation and maintenance costs of such vehicles to the operation and maintenance costs of other passenger automobiles and light duty trucks.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall provide a report on the results of the study conducted under subparagraph (A) to the Committees on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, within one year after the first such vehicles are acquired.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary and the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall conduct a study of the advisability, feasibility, and timing of the disposal of vehicles acquired under subsection (a) of this section and any problems of such disposal. Such study shall take into account existing laws governing the sale of Government vehicles and shall specifically focus on when to sell such vehicles and what price to charge, without compromising studies of the use of such vehicles authorized under this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary and the Administrator of the General Services Administration shall report the results of the study conducted under subparagraph (A) to the Committees on Commerce, Science, and Transportation and Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives, within 12 months after funds are appropriated for carrying out this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Studies undertaken under this subsection shall be coordinated with relevant testing ac<!-- PDFPage:5911 -->tivities of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Transportation.</p>
