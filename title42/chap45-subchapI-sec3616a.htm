<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 905(a) of Pub. L. 102&ndash;550 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in the past half decade, there have been major legislative and administrative changes in Federal fair housing and fair lending laws and substantial improvements in the Nation's understanding of discrimination in the housing markets;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in response to evidence of continuing housing discrimination, the Congress passed the Fair Housing Act Amendments of 1988 [probably should be the Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, Pub. L. 100&ndash;430, see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note set out under section 3601 of this title], to provide for more effective enforcement of fair housing rights through judicial and administrative avenues and to expand the number of protected classes covered under Federal fair housing laws;</p>

L. 101&ndash;73, see Short Title of 1989 Amendment note set out under 12 U.S.C. 1811], the Congress expanded the disclosure provisions under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act [probably should be the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act of 1975; 12 U.S.C. 2801 et seq.] to provide increased information on the mortgage lending patterns of financial institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) in the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 [42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq.], the Congress provided a clear and comprehensive national mandate for the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) in 1991, data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act disclosed evidence of pervasive discrimination in the Nation's mortgage lending markets;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Housing Discrimination Survey, released by the Department of Housing and Urban Development in 1991, found that Hispanic and African-American homeseekers experience some form of discrimination in at least half of their encounters with sales and rental agents;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the Fair Housing Initiatives Program should be revised and expanded to reflect the significant changes in the fair housing and fair lending area that have taken place since the Program's initial authorization in the Housing and Community Development Act of 1987 [Pub. L. 100&ndash;242, see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note under section 5301 of this title];</p>
