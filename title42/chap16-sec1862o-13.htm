<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Development</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall establish a clearinghouse, in collaboration with 4-year institutions of higher education (including applicable graduate schools and academic departments), and industries and Federal agencies that employ science-trained personnel, to share program elements used in successful professional science master's degree programs and other advanced degree programs related to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Availability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall make the clearinghouse of program elements developed under paragraph (1) available to institutions of higher education that are developing professional science master's degree programs.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Programs authorized</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Director shall award grants to 4-year institutions of higher education to facilitate the <!-- PDFPage:3631 -->institutions&rsquo; creation or improvement of professional science master's degree programs that may include linkages between institutions of higher education and industries that employ science-trained personnel, with an emphasis on practical training and preparation for the workforce in high-need fields.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Application</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">A 4-year institution of higher education desiring a grant under this section shall submit an application to the Director at such time, in such manner, and accompanied by such information as the Director may require. The application shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a description of the professional science master's degree program that the institution of higher education will implement;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) a description of how the professional science master's degree program at the institution of higher education will produce individuals for the workforce in high-need fields;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the amount of funding from non-Federal sources, including from private industries, that the institution of higher education shall use to support the professional science master's degree program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) an assurance that the institution of higher education shall encourage students in the professional science master's degree program to apply for all forms of Federal assistance available to such students, including applicable graduate fellowships and student financial assistance under titles IV and VII of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070 et seq., 1133 et seq.
