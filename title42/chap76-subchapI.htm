<h3 class="section-head">&sect;6211. Incentives to develop underground coal mines</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Loan guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section and rules prescribed under subsection (d) of this section, guarantee loans made to eligible persons described in subsection (c)(1) of this section for the purpose of developing new underground coal mines.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Secretary's determinations prerequisite to loan guarantee; maximum guarantees; aggregate outstanding guaranteed loans; new underground coal mines</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) A person may receive for a loan guarantee under subsection (a) of this section only if the Secretary determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such person is capable of successfully developing and operating the mine with respect to which the loan guarantee is sought;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such person has provided adequate assurance that the mine will be constructed and operated in compliance with the provisions of the Federal Coal Mine Health and Safety Act [30 U.S.C. 801 et seq.] and that no final judgment holding such person liable for any fine or penalty under such Act is unsatisfied;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) there is a reasonable prospect of repayment of the guaranteed loan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) such person has obtained a contract, of at least the duration of the period during which the loan is required to be repaid, for the sale or resale of coal to be produced from such mine to a person who the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency certifies will be able to burn such coal in compliance with all applicable requirements of the Clean Air Act [42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.], and of any applicable implementation plan (as defined in section 110 of such Act) [42 U.S.C. 7410];</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the loan will be adequately secured;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) such person would be unable to obtain adequate financing without such guarantee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) the guaranteeing of a loan to such person will enhance competition or encourage new market entry; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) such person has adequate coal reserves to cover contractual commitments described in subparagraph (D).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The total amount of guarantees issued to any person (including all persons affiliated with such person) may not exceed $30,000,000. The amount of a guarantee issued with respect to any loan may not exceed 80 percent of the lesser of (A) the principal balance of the loan or, (B) the cost of developing such new underground coal mine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The aggregate outstanding principal amount of loans which are guaranteed under this section may not at any time exceed $750,000,000. Not more than 20 percent of the amount of guarantees issued under this section in any fiscal year may be issued with respect to loans for the purpose of opening new underground coal mines which produce coal which is not low sulfur coal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Construction and definition of terms</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A person shall be considered eligible for a guarantee under this section if such person (together with all persons affiliated with such person)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) did not produce more than 1,000,000 tons of coal in the calendar year preceding the year in which he makes application for a loan guarantee under this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) did not produce more than 300,000 barrels of crude oil or own an oil refinery in such preceding calendar year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) did not have gross revenues in excess of $50,000,000 in such calendar year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) A person is affiliated with another person if he controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with such other person, as such term may be further defined by rule by the Secretary.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;low sulfur coal&rdquo; means coal which, in a quantity necessary to produce one million British thermal units, does not contain sulfur or sulfur compounds the elemental sulfur content of which exceeds 0.6 pound. Sulfur content shall be determined after the application of any coal preparation process which takes place before sale of the coal by the producer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;developing new underground coal mine&rdquo; includes expansion of any existing underground coal mine in a manner designed to increase the rate of production of such mine, and the reopening of any underground coal mine which had previously been closed. Such term also includes construction of a coal <!-- PDFPage:3939 -->preparation plant which is designed to reduce the sulfur content of coal produced from any coal mine.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Rules and regulations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary or appropriate to carry out this section. Such rules shall require that each application for a guarantee under this section shall be made in writing to the Secretary in such form and with such content and other submissions as the Secretary shall require, in order reasonably to protect the interests of the United States. Each guarantee shall be issued in accordance with subsections (a) through (c) of this section, and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) under such terms and conditions as the Secretary, in consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury, considers appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) with such provisions with respect to the date of issue of such guarantee as the Secretary, with the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury, considers appropriate, except that the required concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury may not, without the consent of the Secretary, result in a delay in the issuance of such guarantee for more than 60 days; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in such form as the Secretary considers appropriate.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Recordkeeping</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each person who receives a loan guarantee under this section shall keep such records as the Secretary or the Secretary of the Treasury shall require, including records which fully disclose the total cost of the project for which a loan is guaranteed under this section and such other records as the Secretary or the Secretary of the Treasury determines necessary to facilitate an effective audit and performance evaluation. The Secretary, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Comptroller General of the United States, or any of their duly authorized representatives, shall have access for the purpose of audit and examination to any pertinent books, documents, papers, and records of any person who receives a loan guarantee under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) management and operation costs;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) an evaluation of the impact of developing the Reserve, taking into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the availability and the price of supplies and equipment and the effect, if any, upon domestic production of acquiring such supplies and equipment for the Reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) any fluctuations in world, and domestic, market prices for petroleum products which may result from the acquisition of substantial quantities of petroleum products for the Reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the extent to which such acquisition may support otherwise declining market prices for such products; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The President shall immediately undertake, and thereafter continue, petroleum products acquisition, transportation, and injection activities, to the extent funds are available pursuant to section 6247(b)(2) and (b)(3) of this title, at a level sufficient to assure that the petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average annual rate of at least the minimum required fill rate until the quantity of petroleum products stored within the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at least 500,000,000 barrels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Subject to subparagraph (C), the minimum required fill rate shall be 300,000 barrels per day for purposes of subparagraph (A), unless there is in effect a finding by the President in his discretion for good cause that compliance with such rate would not be in the national interest. Any finding by the President under this subparagraph takes effect on the date such finding is transmitted to the Congress and ceases to have effect at the end of the fiscal year in which such finding was made. Any such finding transmitted to the Congress shall include a statement of the facts upon which the finding is based. Any such finding shall not be subject to judicial review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The minimum required fill rate shall be 220,000 barrels per day for purposes of subparagraph (A) during the period in which any finding by the President under subparagraph (B) is in effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) If funds are available in any given fiscal year after fiscal year 1982 to achieve an average annual fill rate higher than the minimum required fill rate in effect under subparagraph (C), the minimum required fill rate shall be the highest practicable fill rate achievable, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Impoundment Control Act of 1974 [2 U.S.C. 681 et seq.] shall apply to funds made available under section 6247(b) and (e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After the Strategic Petroleum Reserve reaches a level of 500,000,000 barrels, the President shall immediately seek to undertake, and thereafter continue, petroleum products acquisition, transportation, and injection activities at a level sufficient to assure that the petroleum products in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average annual rate of at least 300,000 barrels per day until the quantity of petroleum products stored within the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at least 750,000,000 barrels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (2), beginning in fiscal year 1987 and continuing through fiscal year 1994 until the quantity of crude oil in storage within the Reserve is 1,000,000,000 barrels, the President shall carry out petroleum acquisition, transportation, and injection activities at the highest practicable fill rate achievable, subject to the availability of appropriated funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Crude oil from Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1; reduction in fill-rate requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no portion of the United States share of crude oil in Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 (Elk Hills) may be sold or otherwise disposed of other than to the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (either directly or by exchange) during any fiscal year, except as provided in paragraph (2), unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the quantity of crude oil in storage within Government owned facilities of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is at least 750,000,000 barrels; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) acquisition, transportation, and injection activities for the Reserve are being undertaken for that fiscal year at a level sufficient to assure that crude oil in storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve will be increased at an average rate of at least 75,000 barrels per day for that fiscal year and the Secretary has amended the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan as required by section 6239(j) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The requirements of paragraph (1) shall not apply to the United States share of crude oil in the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1 which is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) sold to small refiners under section 7430(d) of title 10;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3950 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) produced, consistent with sound engineering practices, for the purpose of preventing a reduction in the total quantity of crude oil available for ultimate recovery from the Naval Petroleum Reserve Numbered 1, and the amount produced is the minimum necessary to prevent such reduction; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) produced for national defense purposes under section 7422(b)(2) of title 10, pursuant to an authorization of Congress under that section during the preceding 9-month period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining the number of barrels of crude oil for purposes of subparagraph (A) of paragraph (1), any crude oil drawndown from the Reserve as a result of any drawdown and distribution carried out under section 6241(g) of this title and not replaced under section 6241(g)(6)(B) of this title shall be considered to be within the Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For any fiscal year in which purchases of petroleum products are suspended, or the sale of petroleum products is carried out, under subsection (f) of this section, the fill-rate requirements of paragraph (1)(B) shall be reduced by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount of petroleum products are&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6240_1_target" name="6240_1">1</a></sup> acquired for such fiscal year as a result of such suspension; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount of petroleum products sold under such subsection during such fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Suspensions of fill operations, etc., during emergency situations; applicability, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The provisions of subsections (c) and (d) of this section shall not apply (A) if there is in effect an order of the President directing drawdown and distribution pursuant to section 6241 of this title or (B) if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the President has found in his discretion that compliance with such provisions significantly impairs the ability of the United States to respond to a severe energy supply interruption or to meet the obligations of the United States under the international energy program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the President has transmitted such finding to the Congress.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The suspension of the application of subsections (c) and (d) of this section under paragraph (1)(B) may become effective on the day the finding is transmitted to the Congress and shall terminate nine months thereafter or on such earlier date as is specified in such finding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The period of any suspension of subsections (c) and (d) of this section under this subsection, and the quantity of any petroleum product involved, shall be disregarded in applying the provisions of such subsections for periods following such suspension.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Predrawdown diversion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary finds that a severe energy supply interruption may be imminent, the Secretary may suspend the acquisition of petroleum product for, and the injection of petroleum product into, the Reserve and may sell any petroleum product acquired for and in transit to, but not injected into, the Reserve.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Test program of storage of refined petroleum products; report to Congress</h4>

The test program shall demonstrate mechanisms for storage of refined petroleum products within the Reserve which may be drawn down in accordance with this part.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The mechanisms demonstrated under paragraph (1)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall include the acquisition by lease or purchase, or both, of refined petroleum products for storage in the Reserve and shall include the acquisition by lease of storage facilities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may include other mechanisms including, but not limited to, industrial petroleum reserves pursuant to section 6236 of this title and State set-aside programs, except that such mechanisms must provide equivalent control over the drawdown and distribution of such refined petroleum products as is provided under this part.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any refined petroleum products stored in the Reserve under this subsection shall be stored in locations to be determined by the Secretary, taking into account the proximity of existing distribution systems, the proximity of the area or areas of the United States most dependent on imported petroleum products or likely to experience shortages of refined petroleum products, and the capability for expeditious distribution to such area or areas.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the conduct of the test program under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall increase the quantity of refined petroleum products acquired for storage in the Reserve by an amount equal to 10 percent of the fill of the Reserve during each of the fiscal years 1992, 1993, and 1994, except that the Secretary may not expend more than 10 percent of the funds appropriated for the acquisition, transportation and injection of petroleum products into the Reserve during each of the fiscal years covered by the test program.</p>

The report shall include an assessment of the costs and benefits of the various mechanisms. The report shall also make recommendations with regard to future storage of refined petroleum products and contain drafts of any legislative provisions which the Secretary wishes to recommend.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:3951 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Purchase from stripper well properties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the President finds that declines in the production of oil from domestic resources pose a threat to national energy security, the President may direct the Secretary to acquire oil from domestic production of stripper well properties for storage in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. Except as provided in paragraph (2), the Secretary may set such terms and conditions as he deems necessary for such acquisition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Crude oil purchased by the Secretary pursuant to this subsection shall be by competitive bid. The price paid by the Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall take into account the cost of production including costs of reservoir and well maintenance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall not exceed the price that would have been paid if the Secretary had acquired petroleum products of a similar quality on the open market under competitive bid procedures without regard to the source of the petroleum products.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may drawdown and distribute the Reserve only in accordance with the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Drawdown and distribution of Reserve in accordance with Distribution Plan contained in Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (c), (f), and (g) of this section, no drawdown and distribution of the Reserve may be made except in accordance with the provisions of the Distribution Plan contained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan which has taken effect pursuant to section 6239(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Drawdown and distribution of Early Storage Reserve in accordance with Distribution Plan contained in Early Storage Reserve Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Drawdown and distribution of the Early Storage Reserve may be made in accordance with the provisions of the Distribution Plan contained in the Early Storage Reserve Plan until the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan has taken effect pursuant to section 6239(a) of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Presidential finding prerequisite to implementation of Distribution Plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Neither the Distribution Plan contained in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Plan nor the Distribution Plan contained in the Early Storage Reserve Plan may be implemented, and no drawdown and distribution of the Reserve or the Early Storage Reserve may be made, unless the President has found that implementation of either such Distribution Plan is required by a severe energy supply interruption or by obligations of the United States under the international energy program.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this section, in addition to the circumstances set forth in section 6202(8) of this title, a severe energy supply interruption shall be deemed to exist if the President determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an emergency situation exists and there is a significant reduction in supply which is of significant scope and duration;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a severe increase in the price of petroleum products has resulted from such emergency situation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) such price increase is likely to cause a major adverse impact on the national economy.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may, by rule, provide for the allocation of any petroleum product withdrawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in amounts specified in (or determined in a manner prescribed by) and at prices specified in (or determined in a manner prescribed by) such rules. <!-- PDFPage:3954 -->Such price levels and allocation procedures shall be consistent with the attainment, to the maximum extent practicable, of the objectives specified in section 753(b)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#6241_1_target" name="6241_1">1</a></sup> of title 15.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Removal or disposal of products in Industrial Petroleum Reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may permit any importer or refiner who owns any petroleum products stored in the Industrial Petroleum Reserve pursuant to section 6236 of this title to remove or otherwise dispose of such products upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Directive to carry out test drawdown</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall conduct a continuing evaluation of the Distribution Plan. In the conduct of such evaluation, the Secretary is authorized to carry out test drawdown and distribution of crude oil from the Reserve. If any such test drawdown includes the sale or exchange of crude oil, then the aggregate quantity of crude oil withdrawn from the Reserve may not exceed 5,000,000 barrels during any such test drawdown or distribution.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall carry out such drawdown and distribution in accordance with the Distribution Plan and implementing regulations and contract provisions, modified as the Secretary considers appropriate taking into consideration the artificialities of a test and the absence of a severe energy supply interruption. To meet the requirements of subsections (d) and (e) of section 6239 of this title, the Secretary shall transmit any such modification of the Plan, along with explanatory and supporting material, to both Houses of the Congress no later than 15 calendar days prior to the offering of any crude oil for sale under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary may not sell any crude oil under this subsection at a price less than that which the Secretary determines appropriate and, in no event, at a price less than 90 percent of the sales price, as estimated by the Secretary, of comparable crude oil being sold in the same area at the time the Secretary is offering crude oil for sale in such area under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Secretary may cancel any offer to sell or exchange crude oil as part of any drawdown and distribution under this subsection if the Secretary determines that there are insufficient acceptable offers to obtain such crude oil.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) The minimum required fill rate in effect for any fiscal year shall be reduced by the amount of any crude oil drawdown from the Reserve under this subsection during such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of a sale of any crude oil under this subsection, the Secretary shall, to the extent funds are available in the SPR Petroleum Account as a result of such sale, acquire crude oil for the Reserve within the 12-month period beginning after the completion of the sale. Such acquisition shall be in addition to any acquisition of crude oil for the Reserve required as part of a fill rate established by any other provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Rules, regulations, or orders issued in order to carry out this subsection which have the applicability and effect of a rule as defined in section 551(4) of title 5 shall not be subject to the requirements of subchapter II of chapter 5 of such title or to section 6393 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The Secretary shall transmit to both Houses of the Congress a detailed explanation of the drawdown and distribution carried out under this subsection. Such explanation may be a part of any report made to the President and the Congress under section 6245 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Prevention or reduction of adverse impact of severe domestic energy supply interruptions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If the President finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a circumstance, other than those described in subsection (d) of this section, exists that constitutes, or is likely to become, a domestic or international energy supply shortage of significant scope or duration; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) action taken under this subsection would assist directly and significantly in preventing or reducing the adverse impact of such shortage,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the Secretary may, subject to the limitations of paragraph (2), draw down and distribute the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In no case may the Reserve be drawn down under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in excess of an aggregate of 30,000,000 barrels with respect to each such shortage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for more than 60 days with respect to each such shortage;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) if there are fewer than 500,000,000 barrels of petroleum product stored in the Reserve; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) below the level of an aggregate of 500,000,000 barrels of petroleum product stored in the Reserve.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) During any period in which there is a drawdown and distribution of the Reserve in effect under this subsection, the Secretary shall transmit a monthly report to the Congress containing an account of the drawdown and distribution of petroleum products under this subsection and an assessment of its effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In no case may the drawdown under this subsection be extended beyond 60 days with respect to any domestic energy supply shortage.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Exchange of withdrawn products</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Notwithstanding any other law, the President may permit any petroleum products withdrawn from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in accordance with this section to be sold and delivered for refining or exchange outside of the United States, in connection with an arrangement for the delivery of refined petroleum products to the United States.</p>
