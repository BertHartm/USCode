Former section 3002(28), which defined &ldquo;frail&rdquo; and contained subpars. (A)(i) and (B) specifying conditions, was redesignated section 3002(26) by Pub. L. 106&ndash;501, title I, &sect;101(5), Nov. 13, 2000, 114 Stat. 2229. Section 3002(28) defines the term &ldquo;greatest social need&rdquo; and does not contain a subpar. (A)(i).</p>
