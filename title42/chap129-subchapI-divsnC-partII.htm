<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Requirements for grant recipients</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) to report on the program's performance on standardized measures and performance levels established by the Corporation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) to cooperate with any evaluation activities undertaken by the Corporation; and</p>
