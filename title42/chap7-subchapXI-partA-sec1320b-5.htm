<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that health care providers (as defined in subsection (g)(2) of this section) that furnish such items and services in good faith, but that <!-- PDFPage:1794 -->are unable to comply with one or more requirements described in subsection (b) of this section, may be reimbursed for such items and services and exempted from sanctions for such noncompliance, absent any determination of fraud or abuse.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Secretarial authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the extent necessary to accomplish the purpose specified in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary is authorized, subject to the provisions of this section, to temporarily waive or modify the application of, with respect to health care items and services furnished by a health care provider (or classes of health care providers) in any emergency area (or portion of such an area) during any portion of an emergency period, the requirements of subchapters XVIII, XIX, or XXI of this chapter, or any regulation thereunder (and the requirements of this subchapter other than this section, and regulations thereunder, insofar as they relate to such subchapters), pertaining to&mdash;</p>
