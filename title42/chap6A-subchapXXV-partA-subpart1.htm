<h4 class="subparagraph-head">(C) Issuer compliance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">To the extent that medical care under a group health plan consists of group health insurance coverage, the plan is deemed to have satisfied the certification requirement under this paragraph if the health insurance issuer offering the coverage provides for such certification in accordance with this paragraph.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The employee's or dependent's coverage described in subparagraph (A)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) was under a COBRA continuation provision and the coverage under such provision was exhausted; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Under the terms of the plan, the employee requests such enrollment not later than 30 days after the date of exhaustion of coverage described in subparagraph (C)(i) or termination of coverage or employer contribution described in subparagraph (C)(ii).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">A health maintenance organization which offers health insurance coverage in connection with a group health plan and which does not impose any preexisting condition exclusion allowed under subsection (a) of this section with respect to any particular coverage option may impose an affiliation period for such coverage option, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such period is applied uniformly without regard to any health status-related factors; and</p>
