<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the late Spark M. Matsunaga, United States Senator from Hawaii, was a longstanding champion of research and development of renewable energy, particularly wind and ocean energy, photovoltaics, and hydrogen fuels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) it was Senator Matsunaga's vision that renewable energy could provide a sustained source of non-polluting energy and that such forms of alternative energy might ultimately be employed in the production of liquid hydrogen as a transportation fuel and energy storage medium available as an energy export;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Senator Matsunaga also believed that research on other aspects of renewable energy and ocean resources, such as advanced materials, could be crucial to full development of energy storage and conversion systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Keahole Point, Hawaii is particularly well-suited as a site to conduct renewable energy and associated marine research.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this section to establish the facilities and equipment located at Keahole Point, Hawaii as a cooperative research and development facility, to be known as the Spark M. Matsunaga Renewable Energy and Ocean Technology Center.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The facilities and equipment located at Keahole Point, Hawaii are established as the Spark M. Matsunaga Renewable Energy and Ocean Technology Center (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Center&rdquo;).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administration</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) renewable energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) energy storage, including the production of hydrogen from renewable energy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) materials applications related to energy and marine environments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) other environmental and ocean research concepts, including sea ranching and global climate change; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) such other matters as the Secretary may direct.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Matching funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To be eligible for Federal funds under this section, the Center must provide funding in cash or in kind from non-Federal sources for each amount provided by the Secretary.</p>
