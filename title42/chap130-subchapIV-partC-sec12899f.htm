(10), was in the original section 7004(a) of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, and was translated as if it read section 7501(8) of that Act to reflect the probable intent of Congress, because the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 does not contain a section 7004, and section 7501(8) defines limited English proficiency.</p>
