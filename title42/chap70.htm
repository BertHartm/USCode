<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment pursuant to orders of Secretary; consultation with Consumer Product Safety Commission; reasonableness; consideration of State and local laws</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, after consultation with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, shall establish by order appropriate Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards. Each such Federal manufactured home standard shall be reasonable and shall meet the highest standards of protection, taking into account existing State and local laws relating to manufactured home safety and construction.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notice and hearing</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All orders issued under this section shall be issued after notice and an opportunity for interested persons to participate are provided in accordance with the provisions of section 553 of title 5.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Effective date of orders establishing standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each order establishing a Federal manufactured home construction and safety standard shall specify the date such standard is to take effect, which shall not be sooner than one hundred and eighty days or later than one year after the date such order is issued, unless the Secretary finds, for good cause shown, that an earlier or later effective date is in the public interest, and publishes his reasons for such finding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Supremacy of Federal standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever a Federal manufactured home construction and safety standard established under this chapter is in effect, no State or political subdivision of a State shall have any authority either to establish, or to continue in effect, with respect to any manufactured home covered, any standard regarding the construction or safety applicable to the same aspect of performance of such manufactured home which is not identical to the Federal manufactured home construction and safety standard.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Amendment or revocation by Secretary; effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary may by order amend or revoke any Federal manufactured home construction or safety standard established under this section. Such order shall specify the date on which such amendment or revocation is to take effect, which shall not be sooner than one hundred and eighty days or later than one year from the date the order is issued, unless the Secretary finds, for good cause shown, that an earlier or later date is in the public interest, and publishes his reasons for such finding.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Criteria</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In establishing standards under this section, the Secretary shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) consider relevant available manufactured home construction and safety data, including the results of the research, development, testing, and evaluation activities conducted pursuant to this chapter, and those activities conducted by private organizations and other governmental agencies to determine how to best protect the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) consult with such State or interstate agencies (including legislative committees) as he deems appropriate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) consider whether any such proposed standard is reasonable for the particular type of manufactured home or for the geographic region for which it is prescribed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) consider the probable effect of such standard on the cost of the manufactured home to the public; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) consider the extent to which any such standard will contribute to carrying out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Time for issuance of order establishing initial standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall issue an order establishing initial Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards not later than one year after August 22, 1974.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Coverage; exclusion</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall exclude from the coverage of this chapter any structure which the manufacturer certifies, in a form prescribed by the Secretary, to be:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) designed only for erection or installation on a site-built permanent foundation;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) designed and manufactured to comply with a nationally recognized model building code or an equivalent local code, or with a State or local modular building code recognized as generally equivalent to building codes for site-built housing, or with minimum property standards adopted by the Secretary pursuant to title II of the National Housing Act [12 U.S.C. 1707 et seq.]; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) to the manufacturer's knowledge is not intended to be used other than on a site-built permanent foundation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Manufactured housing construction and safety standards</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Federal manufactured home construction and safety standards established by the <!-- PDFPage:3831 -->Secretary under this section shall include preemptive energy conservation standards in accordance with this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The energy conservation standards established under this subsection shall be cost-effective energy conservation performance standards designed to ensure the lowest total of construction and operating costs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The energy conservation standards established under this subsection shall take into consideration the design and factory construction techniques of manufactured homes and shall provide for alternative practices that result in net estimated energy consumption equal to or less than the specified standards.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) New performance standards for hardboard siding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall develop a new standard for hardboard panel siding on manufactured housing taking into account durability, longevity, consumer's costs for maintenance and any other relevant information pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. The Secretary shall consult with the National Manufactured Home Advisory Council and the National Commission on Manufactured Housing in establishing the new standard. The new performance standard developed shall ensure the durability of hardboard sidings for at least a normal life of a mortgage with minimum maintenance required. Not later than 180 days from October 28, 1992, the Secretary shall update the standards for hardboard siding.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) In a case of actual controversy as to the validity of any order under section 5403 of this title, any person who may be adversely affected by such order when it is effective may at any time prior to the sixtieth day after such order is issued file a petition with the United States court of appeals for the circuit wherein such person resides or has his principal place of business, for judicial review of such order. A copy of the petition shall be forthwith transmitted by the clerk of the court to the Secretary or other officer designated by him for that purpose. The Secretary thereupon shall file in the court the record of the proceedings on which the Secretary based his order, as provided in section 2112 of title 28.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If the petitioner applies to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and shows to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for the failure to adduce such evidence in the proceeding before the Secretary, the court may order such additional evidence (and evidence in rebuttal thereof) to be taken before the Secretary, and to be adduced upon the hearing, in such manner and upon such terms and conditions as to the court may seem proper. The Secretary may modify his findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of the additional evidence so taken, and he shall file such modified or new findings, and his recommendation, if any, for the modification or setting aside of his original order, with the return of such additional evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Upon the filing of the petition referred to in paragraph (1) of this subsection, the court shall have jurisdiction to review the order in accordance with the provisions of sections 701 through 706 of title 5, and to grant appropriate relief.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Such information shall be available to the public unless the manufacturer establishes that it contains a trade secret or that disclosure of any portion of such information would put the manufacturer at a substantial competitive disadvantage. Notice of the availability of such information shall be published promptly in the Federal Register.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Notice to purchaser within reasonable time after discovery of defect</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every manufacturer of manufactured homes shall furnish notification of any defect in any manufactured home produced by such manufacturer which he determines, in good faith, relates to a Federal manufactured home construction or safety standard or contains a defect which constitutes an imminent safety hazard to the purchaser of such manufactured home, within a reasonable time after such manufacturer has discovered such defect.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Notification by mail</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notification required by subsection (a) of this section shall be accomplished&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by mail to the first purchaser (not including any dealer or distributor of such manufacturer) of the manufactured home containing the defect, and to any subsequent purchaser to whom any warranty on such manufactured home has been transferred;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by mail to any other person who is a registered owner of such manufactured home and whose name and address has been ascertained pursuant to procedures established under subsection (f) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by mail or other more expeditious means to the dealer or dealers of such manufacturer to whom such manufactured home was delivered.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Form and requisites of notification</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The notification required by subsection (a) of this section shall contain a clear description of such defect or failure to comply, an evaluation of the risk to manufactured home occupants&rsquo; safety reasonably related to such defect, and a statement of the measures needed to repair the defect. The notification shall also inform the owner whether the defect is a construction or safety defect which the manufacturer will have corrected at no cost to the owner of the manufactured home under subsection (g) of this section or otherwise, or is a defect which must be corrected at the expense of the owner.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Copy to Secretary of all notices, bulletins, and communications sent by manufacturer to dealers and purchasers concerning defects; disclosure to public by Secretary</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every manufacturer of manufactured homes shall furnish to the Secretary a true or representative copy of all notices, bulletins, and other communications to the dealers of such <!-- PDFPage:3838 -->manufacturer or purchasers of manufactured homes of such manufacturer regarding any defect in any such manufactured home produced by such manufacturer. The Secretary shall disclose to the public so much of the information contained in such notices or other information obtained under section 5413 of this title as he deems will assist in carrying out the purposes of this chapter, but he shall not disclose any information which contains or relates to a trade secret, or which, if disclosed, would put such manufacturer at a substantial competitive disadvantage, unless he determines that it is necessary to carry out the purposes of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Notice by Secretary to manufacturers of noncompliance with standards or defective nature of manufactured home; contents of notice; presentation by manufacturer of views; notice to purchasers of defects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that any manufactured home&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) does not comply with an applicable Federal manufactured home construction and safety standard prescribed pursuant to section 5403 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contains a defect which constitutes an imminent safety hazard,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then he shall immediately notify the manufacturer of such manufactured home of such defect or failure to comply. The notice shall contain the findings of the Secretary and shall include all information upon which the findings are based. The Secretary shall afford such manufacturer an opportunity to present his views and evidence in support thereof, to establish that there is no failure of compliance. If after such presentation by the manufacturer the Secretary determines that such manufactured home does not comply with applicable Federal manufactured home construction or safety standards, or contains a defect which constitutes an imminent safety hazard, the Secretary shall direct the manufacturer to furnish the notification specified in subsections (a) and (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Maintenance by manufacturers of record of names and addresses of first purchasers of manufactured homes; procedures for ascertaining names and addresses of subsequent purchasers; establishment and reasonableness of procedures for maintaining records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Every manufacturer of manufactured homes shall maintain a record of the name and address of the first purchaser of each manufactured home (for purposes other than resale), and, to the maximum extent feasible, shall maintain procedures for ascertaining the name and address of any subsequent purchaser thereof and shall maintain a record of names and addresses so ascertained. Such records shall be kept for each home produced by a manufacturer. The Secretary may establish by order procedures to be followed by manufacturers in establishing and maintaining such records, including procedures to be followed by distributors and dealers to assist manufacturers to secure the information required by this subsection. Such procedures shall be reasonable for the particular type of manufactured home for which they are prescribed.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Correction of defects by manufacturer; conditions; procedures; contract or legal rights of purchasers or other persons unaffected</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A manufacturer required to furnish notification of a defect under subsection (a) or (e) of this section shall also bring the manufactured home into compliance with applicable standards and correct the defect or have the defect corrected within a reasonable period of time at no expense to the owner, but only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the defect presents an unreasonable risk of injury or death to occupants of the affected manufactured home or homes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the defect can be related to an error in design or assembly of the manufactured home by the manufacturer.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Secretary may direct the manufacturer to make such corrections after providing an opportunity for oral and written presentation of views by interested persons. Nothing in this section shall limit the rights of the purchaser or any other person under any contract or applicable law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Submission to Secretary by manufacturer of plan for notifying owners of defects and repair of defects; approval of manufacturer's remedy plan; effectuation and implementation of remedy plan</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The manufacturer shall submit his plan for notifying owners of the defect and for repairing such defect (if required under subsection (g) of this section) to the Secretary for his approval before implementing such plan. Whenever a manufacturer is required under subsection (g) of this section to correct a defect, the Secretary shall approve with or without modification, after consultation with the manufacturer of the manufactured home involved, such manufacturer's remedy plan including the date when, and the method by which, the notification and remedy required pursuant to this section shall be effectuated. Such date shall be the earliest practicable one but shall not be more than sixty days after the date of discovery or determination of the defect or failure to comply, unless the Secretary grants an extension of such period for good cause shown and publishes a notice of such extension in the Federal Register. Such manufacturer is bound to implement such remedy plan as approved by the Secretary.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Defective or inadequately repaired manufactured homes; replacement with new or equivalent home or refund of purchase price</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where a defect or failure to comply in a manufactured home cannot be adequately repaired within sixty days from the date of discovery or determination of the defect, the Secretary may require that the manufactured home be replaced with a new or equivalent home without charge, or that the purchase price be refunded in full, less a reasonable allowance for depreciation based on actual use if the home has been in the possession of the owner for more than one year.</p>
