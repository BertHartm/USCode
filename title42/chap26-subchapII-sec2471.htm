<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 101&ndash;611, title I, &sect;114, Nov. 16, 1990, 104 Stat. 3200, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the President on July 20, 1989, established the long-range goal of establishing a lunar base, followed by manned exploration of Mars in the early twenty-first century;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States and the Soviet Union, in cooperation with other countries, are currently planning further unmanned missions to the Moon and to Mars with the possible goal of landing a human on Mars;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) a series of international missions to expand human presence beyond Earth orbit would further a spirit of, and follow through on the commitment made in, the 1987 agreement between the Soviet Union and the United States for space cooperation, as well as the successful cooperative agreements the United States has pursued with over one hundred countries since its inception, including the agreement with Japan, Canada, and the European countries for Space Station Freedom;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) international manned missions beyond Earth orbit could further encourage a cooperative approach in world affairs unrelated to activities in space;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) international manned missions beyond Earth orbit could save the individual nations involved tens of billions of dollars over national missions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) a multilateral effort for manned missions to establish a lunar colony, a Mars mission, and any other missions that have the goal of establishing human presence beyond Earth's orbit and possibly landing a human on Mars would lead to greater understanding of our universe and greater sensitivity to our own planet.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The National Space Council shall conduct a study on International Cooperation in Planetary Exploration (hereafter in this section referred to as the &lsquo;study&rsquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Purpose of Study</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The purpose of the study is&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to develop an inventory of technologies and intentions of all national space agencies with regard to lunar and planetary exploration, both manned and unmanned;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to seek ways, through direct communication with appropriate officials of other nations or otherwise, to enhance the planning and exchange of information and data among the United States, the Soviet Union, European countries, Canada, Japan, and other interested countries with respect to unmanned projects beyond Earth orbit, in anticipation of later international manned missions to the Moon and to other bodies, including the possible goal of an international manned mission to Mars;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to prepare a detailed proposal that most efficiently uses the resources of the national space agencies in cooperative endeavors to establish human presence beyond Earth orbit;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to develop priority goals that accomplish unmet needs that could not be achieved by any individual country;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to explore the possibilities of international unmanned probes to the Moon and Mars, and the possibilities for international manned missions beyond Earth's orbit; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to devise strategies for such cooperation that would prevent the unwanted transfer of technology.</p>
<p class="note-body-block">In developing the inventory under paragraph (1), and in preparing the detailed proposal under paragraph (3), consideration shall be given to the potential contributions of commercial providers of space goods and services.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Report</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The National Space Council shall, within one year after the date of the enactment of this Act [Nov. 16, 1990], prepare and submit to Congress a report&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) outlining a preliminary strategy for cooperation among the United States, the Soviet Union, European countries, Canada, Japan, and other interested countries, based on their respective national strengths, with respect to unmanned projects beyond Earth orbit, in anticipation of later international manned missions to the Moon and to other bodies, including the possible goal of an international manned mission to Mars;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) including a conceptual design of a possible international manned mission, in coordination with the preliminary strategy referred to in paragraph (1), with target dates and a breakdown of responsibilities by nation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) containing an inventory of planned and anticipated missions, manned and unmanned, that are being considered by national space agencies and commercial providers of space goods and services; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) containing an inventory of space exploration technologies that either&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) are not immediately available in the United States but are available from other nations; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) are available in the United States but are available from other nations in equal or superior form.&rdquo;</p>
