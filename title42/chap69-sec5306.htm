<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Amounts allocated to Indian tribes, discretionary fund, and metropolitan cities and urban counties; limitations on amount of annual grants</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) For each fiscal year, of the amount approved in an appropriation Act under section 5303 of this title for grants in any year (excluding the amounts provided for use in accordance with section 5307 of this title), the Secretary shall reserve for grants to Indian tribes 1 percent of the amount appropriated under such section. The Secretary shall provide for distribution of amounts under this paragraph to Indian tribes on the basis of a competition conducted pursuant to specific criteria for the selection of Indian tribes to receive such amounts. The criteria shall be contained in a regulation promulgated by the Secretary after notice and public comment. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, such grants to Indian tribes shall not be subject to the requirements of section 5304 of this title, except subsections (f), (g), and (k) of such section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) After reserving such amounts for Indian tribes, the Secretary shall allocate amounts provided for use under section 5307 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Of the amount remaining after allocations pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2), 70 percent <!-- PDFPage:3660 -->shall be allocated by the Secretary to metropolitan cities and urban counties. Except as otherwise specifically authorized, each metropolitan city and urban county shall be entitled to an annual grant from such allocation in an amount not exceeding its basic amount computed pursuant to paragraph (1) or (2) of subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Computation of amount allocated to metropolitan cities and urban counties</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Secretary shall determine the amount to be allocated to each metropolitan city which shall be the greater of an amount that bears the same ratio to the allocation for all metropolitan areas as either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the average of the ratios between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the population of that city and the population of all metropolitan areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the extent of poverty in that city and the extent of poverty in all metropolitan areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the extent of housing overcrowding in that city and the extent of housing overcrowding in all metropolitan areas; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the average of the ratios between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the extent of growth lag in that city and the extent of growth lag in all metropolitan cities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the extent of poverty in that city and the extent of poverty in all metropolitan areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the age of housing in that city and the age of housing in all metropolitan areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Secretary shall determine the amount to be allocated to each urban county, which shall be the greater of an amount that bears the same ratio to the allocation for all metropolitan areas as either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the average of the ratios between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the population of that urban county and the population of all metropolitan areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the extent of poverty in that urban county and the extent of poverty in all metropolitan areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the extent of housing overcrowding in that urban county and the extent of housing overcrowding in all metropolitan areas; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the average of the ratios between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the extent of growth lag in that urban county and the extent of growth lag in all metropolitan cities and urban counties;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the extent of poverty in that urban county and the extent of poverty in all metropolitan areas; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) the age of housing in that urban county and the age of housing in all metropolitan areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In determining the average of ratios under paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(A), the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted twice, and each of the other ratios shall be counted once; and in determining the average of ratios under paragraphs (1)(B) and (2)(B), the ratio involving the extent of growth lag shall be counted once, the ratio involving the extent of poverty shall be counted one and one-half times, and the ratio involving the age of housing shall be counted two and one-half times.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In computing amounts or exclusions under this section with respect to any urban county, there shall be excluded units of general local government located in the county the populations of which are not counted in determining the eligibility of the urban county to receive a grant under this subsection, except that there shall be included any independent city (as defined by the Bureau of the Census) which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is not part of any county;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not eligible for a grant pursuant to subsection (b)(1) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) is contiguous to the urban county;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) has entered into cooperation agreements with the urban county which provide that the urban county is to undertake or to assist in the undertaking of essential community development and housing assistance activities with respect to such independent city; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) is not included as a part of any other unit of general local government for purposes of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any independent city which is included in any fiscal year for purposes of computing amounts pursuant to the preceding sentence shall not be eligible to receive assistance under subsection (d) of this section with respect to such fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) In computing amounts under this section with respect to any urban county, there shall be included all of the area of any unit of local government which is part of, but is not located entirely within the boundaries of, such urban county if the part of such unit of local government which is within the boundaries of such urban county would otherwise be included in computing the amount for such urban county under this section, and if the part of such unit of local government which is not within the boundaries of such urban county is not included as a part of any other unit of local government for the purpose of this section. Any amount received by such urban county under this section may be used with respect to the part of such unit of local government which is outside the boundaries of such urban county.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Where data are available, the amount determined under paragraph (1) for a metropolitan city that has been formed by the consolidation of one or more metropolitan cities with an urban county shall be equal to the sum of the amounts that would have been determined under paragraph (1) for the metropolitan city or cities and the balance of the consolidated government, if such consolidation had not occurred. This paragraph shall apply only to any consolidation that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) included all metropolitan cities that received grants under this section for the fiscal year preceding such consolidation and that were located within the urban county;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) included the entire urban county that received a grant under this section for the fiscal year preceding such consolidation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) took place on or after January 1, 1983.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The population growth rate of all metropolitan cities referred to in section 5302(a)(12) of this title shall be based on the population of (i) metropolitan cities other than consolidated governments the grant for which is determined under this paragraph; and (ii) cities that were metropolitan cities before their incorporation <!-- PDFPage:3661 -->into consolidated governments. For purposes of calculating the entitlement share for the balance of the consolidated government under this paragraph, the entire balance shall be considered to have been an urban county.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reallocation of undistributed funds within same metropolitan area as original allocation; amount and calculation of reallocation grant; disaster relief</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (4), any amounts allocated to a metropolitan city or an urban county pursuant to the preceding provisions of this section which are not received by the city or county for a fiscal year because of failure to meet the requirements of subsection (a), (b), (c), or (d) of section 5304 of this title, or which become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title, shall be reallocated in the succeeding fiscal year to the other metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same metropolitan area which certify to the satisfaction of the Secretary that they would be adversely affected by the loss of such amounts from the metropolitan area. The amount of the share of funds reallocated under this paragraph for any metropolitan city or urban county shall bear the same ratio to the total of such reallocated funds in the metropolitan area as the amount of funds awarded to the city or county for the fiscal year in which the reallocated funds become available bears to the total amount of funds awarded to all metropolitan cities and urban counties in the same metropolitan area for that fiscal year, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in determining the amounts awarded to cities or counties for purposes of calculating shares pursuant to this sentence, there shall be excluded from the award of any city or county any amounts which become available as a result of actions against such city or county under section 5311 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in reallocating amounts resulting from an action under section 5304(e) of this title or section 5311 of this title, a city or county against whom any such action was taken in a fiscal year shall be excluded from a calculation of share for purposes of reallocating, in the succeeding year, the amounts becoming available as a result of such action; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) in no event may the share of reallocated funds for any metropolitan city or urban county exceed 25 per centum of the amount awarded to the city or county under subsection (b) of this section for the fiscal year in which the reallocated funds under this paragraph become available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any amounts allocated under subsection (b) of this section which become available for reallocation and for which no metropolitan city or urban county qualifies under this paragraph shall be added to amounts available for allocation under such subsection (b) of this section in the succeeding fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the Secretary shall make grants from amounts authorized for use under subsection (b) of this section by the Department of Housing and Urban Development&mdash;Independent Agencies Appropriation Act, 1981, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter which governed grants with respect to such amounts, as such provisions existed prior to October 1, 1981, except that any such amounts which are not obligated before January 1, 1982, shall be reallocated in accordance with paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1), the Secretary may upon request transfer responsibility to any metropolitan city for the administration of any amounts received, but not obligated, by the urban county in which such city is located if (A) such city was an included unit of general local government in such county prior to the qualification of such city as a metropolitan city; (B) such amounts were designated and received by such county for use in such city prior to the qualification of such city as a metropolitan city; and (C) such city and county agree to such transfer of responsibility for the administration of such amounts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), in the event of a major disaster declared by the President under the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.], the Secretary shall make available, to metropolitan cities and urban counties located or partially located in the areas affected by the disaster, any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In using any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title, the Secretary shall give priority to providing emergency assistance under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary may provide assistance to any metropolitan city or urban county under this paragraph only to the extent necessary to meet emergency community development needs, as the Secretary shall determine (subject to subparagraph (D)), of the city or county resulting from the disaster that are not met with amounts otherwise provided under this chapter, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency Assistance Act [42 U.S.C. 5121 et seq.], and other sources of assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Amounts provided to metropolitan cities and urban counties under this paragraph may be used only for eligible activities under section 5305 of this title, and in implementing this section, the Secretary shall evaluate the natural hazards to which any permanent replacement housing is exposed and shall take appropriate action to mitigate such hazards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) The Secretary shall provide for applications (or amended applications and statements under section 5304 of this title) for assistance under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) A metropolitan city or urban county eligible for assistance under this paragraph may receive such assistance only in each of the fiscal years ending during the 3-year period beginning on the date of the declaration of the disaster by the President.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) This paragraph may not be construed to require the Secretary to reserve any amounts that become available as a result of actions under section 5304(e) or 5311 of this title for assistance under this paragraph if, when such amounts are to be reallocated under paragraph (1), no metropolitan city or urban county qualifies for assistance under this paragraph.</p>

The Secretary shall, in order to compensate for the discrepancy between the total of the amounts to be allocated under this paragraph and the total of the amounts available under such paragraph, make a pro rata reduction of each amount allocated to the nonentitlement areas in each State under such paragraph so that the nonentitlement areas in each State will receive an amount which represents the same percentage of the total amount available under such paragraph as the percentage which the nonentitlement areas of the same State would have received under such paragraph if the total amount available under such paragraph had equaled the total amount which was allocated under such paragraph.</p>
