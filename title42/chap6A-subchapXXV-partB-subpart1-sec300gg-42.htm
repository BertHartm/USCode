<p class="statutory-body">A health insurance issuer may nonrenew or discontinue health insurance coverage of an individual in the individual market based only on one or more of the following:</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Nonpayment of premiums</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The individual has failed to pay premiums or contributions in accordance with the terms of the health insurance coverage or the issuer has not received timely premium payments.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Fraud</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Movement outside service area</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of a health insurance issuer that offers health insurance coverage in the market through a network plan, the individual no longer resides, lives, or works in the service area (or in an area for which the issuer is authorized to do business) but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of covered individuals.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Association membership ceases</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In the case of health insurance coverage that is made available in the individual market only through one or more bona fide associations, the membership of the individual in the association (on the basis of which the coverage is provided) ceases but only if such coverage is terminated under this paragraph uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of covered individuals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Requirements for uniform termination of coverage</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Particular type of coverage not offered</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the issuer offers to each individual in the individual market provided coverage of this type, the option to purchase any other individual health insurance coverage currently being offered by the issuer for individuals in such market; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) in exercising the option to discontinue coverage of this type and in offering the option of coverage under subparagraph (B), the issuer acts uniformly without regard to any health status-related factor of enrolled individuals or individuals who may become eligible for such coverage.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Exception for uniform modification of coverage</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the time of coverage renewal, a health insurance issuer may modify the health insurance coverage for a policy form offered to individuals in the individual market so long as such modification is consistent with State law and effective on a uniform basis among all individuals with that policy form.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Application to coverage offered only through associations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In applying this section in the case of health insurance coverage that is made available by a health insurance issuer in the individual market to individuals only through one or more associations, a reference to an &ldquo;individual&rdquo; is deemed to include a reference to such an association (of which the individual is a member).</p>
