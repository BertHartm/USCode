<p class="statutory-body">(b) With regard to any claim arising under this chapter or under the National School Lunch Act [42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq.], the Secretary shall have the authority to determine the amount of, to settle and to adjust any such claim, and to compromise or deny such claim or any part thereof.
