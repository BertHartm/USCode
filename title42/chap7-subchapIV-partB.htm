<p class="statutory-body">(2) The demonstration projects conducted under this section may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) multidisciplinary projects designed to prevent the inappropriate hospitalization of infants and to allow infants described in paragraph (1) to remain with or return to a parent in a residential setting, where appropriate care for the infant and suitable treatment for the parent (including treatment for drug or alcohol addiction) may be assured, with the goal (where possible) of rehabilitating the parent and eliminating the need for such care for the infant;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) multidisciplinary projects that assure appropriate, individualized care for such infants in a foster home or other non-medical residential setting in cases where such infant does not require hospitalization and would otherwise remain in inappropriate hospital settings, including projects to demonstrate methods to recruit, train, and retain foster care families; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) In evaluating applications from entities proposing to conduct demonstration projects under this subsection, the Secretary shall give priority to those projects that serve areas most in need of alternative care arrangements for infants described in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) provide for community education regarding the inappropriate hospitalization of infants;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) use, to the extent practical, other available private, local, State, and Federal sources for the provision of direct services; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) meet such other criteria as the Secretary may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) Grants may be used to pay the costs of maintenance and of necessary medical and social services (to the extent that these costs are not otherwise paid for under other subchapters of this chapter), and for such other purposes as the Secretary may allow.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) The Secretary shall provide training and technical assistance to grantees, as requested.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that there is a continuing urgent need to protect children and to strengthen families as demonstrated by the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Family support programs directed at specific vulnerable populations have had positive effects on parents, children, or both. The vulnerable populations for which programs have been shown to be effective include teenage mothers with very young children and families that have children with special needs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Family preservation programs have been shown to provide extensive and intensive services to families in crisis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The time lines established by the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 have made the prompt availability of services to address family problems (and in particular the prompt availability of appropriate services and treatment addressing substance abuse) an important factor in successful family reunification.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The rapid increases in the annual number of adoptions since the enactment of the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997 have created a growing need for postadoption services and for service providers with the particular knowledge and skills required to address the unique issues adoptive families and children may face.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this program is to enable States to develop and establish, or expand, and to operate coordinated programs of community-based family support services, family preservation services, time-limited family reunification services, and adoption promotion and support services to accomplish the following objectives:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To prevent child maltreatment among families at risk through the provision of supportive family services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To assure children's safety within the home and preserve intact families in which children have been maltreated, when the family's problems can be addressed effectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To address the problems of families whose children have been placed in foster care so that reunification may occur in a safe and stable manner in accordance with the Adoption and Safe Families Act of 1997.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To support adoptive families by providing support services as necessary so that they can make a lifetime commitment to their children.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;629i. Grants for programs for mentoring children of prisoners</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings and purpose</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) In the period between 1991 and 1999, the number of children with a parent incarcerated in a Federal or State correctional facility increased by more than 100 percent, from approximately 900,000 to approximately 2,000,000. In 1999, 2.1 percent of all children in the United States had a parent in Federal or State prison.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Prior to incarceration, 64 percent of female prisoners and 44 percent of male prisoners in State facilities lived with their children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Nearly 90 percent of the children of incarcerated fathers live with their mothers, and 79 percent of the children of incarcerated mothers live with a grandparent or other relative.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) Parental arrest and confinement lead to stress, trauma, stigmatization, and separation problems for children. These problems are coupled with existing problems that include poverty, violence, parental substance abuse, high-crime environments, intrafamilial abuse, child abuse and neglect, multiple care givers, and/or prior separations. As a result, these children often exhibit a broad variety of behavioral, emotional, health, and educational problems that are often compounded by the pain of separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) Empirical research demonstrates that mentoring is a potent force for improving children's behavior across all risk behaviors affecting health. Quality, one-on-one relationships that provide young people with caring role models for future success have profound, life-changing potential. Done right, mentoring markedly advances youths&rsquo; life prospects. A widely cited 1995 study by Public/Private Ventures measured the impact of one Big Brothers Big Sisters program and found significant effects in the lives of youth&mdash;cutting first-time drug use by almost half and first-time alcohol use by about a third, reducing school absenteeism by half, cutting assaultive behavior by a third, improving parental and peer relationships, giving youth greater confidence in their school work, and improving academic performance.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The purpose of this section is to authorize the Secretary to make competitive grants to applicants in areas with substantial numbers of children of incarcerated parents, to support the establishment or expansion and operation of programs using a network of public and private community entities to provide mentoring services for children of prisoners.</p>
