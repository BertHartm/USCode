<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment of guidelines; method</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each State, as a condition for having its State plan approved under this part, must establish guidelines for child support award amounts within the State. The guidelines may be established by law or by judicial or administrative action, and shall be reviewed at least once every 4 years to ensure that their application results in the determination of appropriate child support award amounts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Availability of guidelines; rebuttable presumption</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The guidelines established pursuant to subsection (a) of this section shall be made available to all judges and other officials who have the power to determine child support awards within such State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There shall be a rebuttable presumption, in any judicial or administrative proceeding for the award of child support, that the amount of the award which would result from the application of such guidelines is the correct amount of child support to be awarded. A written finding or specific finding on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate in a particular case, as determined under criteria established by the State, shall be sufficient to rebut the presumption in that case.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1921 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Technical assistance to States; State to furnish Secretary with copies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall furnish technical assistance to the States for establishing the guidelines, and each State shall furnish the Secretary with copies of its guidelines.</p>
