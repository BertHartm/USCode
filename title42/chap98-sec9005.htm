<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, in consultation with the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Administrator of the Maritime Administration, the Administrator of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Technical Panel established under section 9007 of this title, prepare a comprehensive technology application and market development plan that will permit realization of the ten-thousand-megawatt national goal by the year 1999. Such plans shall include at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an assessment of those Government actions required to achieve a two-hundred- to four-hundred-megawatt electrical-commercial demonstration of ocean thermal energy conversion systems in time to have industry meet the goal contained in section 9001(b)(2) of this title including a listing of those financial, property, and patent right packages most likely to lead to early commercial demonstration at minimum cost to the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an assessment of further Government actions required to permit expansion of the domestic ocean thermal energy conversion industry to meet the goal contained in section 9001(b)(3) of this title;</p>
