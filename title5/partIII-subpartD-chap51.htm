<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a plan for classification of positions whereby&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in determining the rate of basic pay which an employee will receive&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work will be followed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) variations in rates of basic pay paid to different employees will be in proportion to substantial differences in the difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements of the work performed and to the contributions of employees to efficiency and economy in the service; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) individual positions will, in accordance with their duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements, be so grouped and iden<!-- PDFPage:307 -->tified by classes and grades, as defined by section 5102 of this title, and the various classes will be so described in published standards, as provided by section 5105 of this title, that the resulting position-classification system can be used in all phases of personnel administration.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section is reorganized and restated for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(i), the exception of &ldquo;a Government controlled corporation&rdquo; is added to preserve the application of this chapter to &ldquo;corporations wholly owned by the United States&rdquo;. This is necessary as the defined term &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; includes the defined term &ldquo;Government corporation&rdquo; and the latter includes both Government owned and controlled corporations. Thus the exclusion of Government controlled corporations, which are distinct from wholly owned corporations, operates to preserve the application of the chapter to wholly owned corporations.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(vii), the words &ldquo;Panama Canal Company&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Panama Railroad Company&rdquo; on authority of the Act of Sept. 26, 1950, ch. 1049, &sect;2(a)(2), 64 Stat. 1038.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception for the Inland Waterways Corporation in former section 1082(13) is omitted on authority of the Act of July 19, 1963, Pub. L. 88&ndash;67, 77 Stat. 81.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exceptions for Production Credit Corporations and Federal Intermediate Credit Banks in former section 1082(18) and (19) are omitted as they are no longer &ldquo;corporations wholly owned by the United States&rdquo;. Under the Farm Credit Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 659, the Production Credit Corporations were merged in the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, and pursuant to that Act the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks have ceased to be corporations wholly owned by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(2) is added for clarity. The reference to &ldquo;an individual employed in or under an agency&rdquo; includes both officers and employees of an agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(5), the words &ldquo;in the General Schedule&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1091(3) to &ldquo;as specified in subchapter V of this chapter&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the reference to former section 1085 is omitted as unnecessary. Former section 1085 which exempted certain agencies from former sections 1151&ndash;1153 is carried into section 305.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;chapter 45 of title 39&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(1) to &ldquo;chapter 23 of title 39&rdquo; on authority of the Act of July 10, 1955, ch. 137, &sect;805, 69 Stat. 130, and the Act of Sept. 2, 1960, Pub. L. 86&ndash;682, &sect;5, 74 Stat. 705.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2)(B), the words &ldquo;this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(2)(B) to &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1923, as amended,&rdquo; on authority of section 1106 of the Act of Oct. 28, 1949, 63 Stat. 972, and technical section 7(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(4), the words &ldquo;chapter 15 of title 31, District of Columbia Code&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(4) to &ldquo;the District of Columbia Teachers Salary Act of 1947, as supplemented by Public Law 151, Eighty-first Congress, approved June 30, 1949&rdquo; on authority of the provisions contained therein. The words &ldquo;District of Columbia Court of General Sessions&rdquo; and &ldquo;District of Columbia Court of Appeals&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Municipal Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia&rdquo;, respectively, on authority of D.C. Code &sect;&sect;11&ndash;902 and 11&ndash;702. The exception for judges of the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia is based on D.C. Code &sect;11&ndash;1502.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(5), the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; is omitted as included in &ldquo;member&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(10), the words &ldquo;sections 6952 and 7478 of title 10&rdquo;, &ldquo;section 7044 of title 10&rdquo;, and &ldquo;section 7043 of title 10&rdquo; are substituted for the references in former section 1082(10) to &ldquo;section 1071 of title 34&rdquo;, &ldquo;sections 1076&ndash;1076f of title 34&rdquo;, and &ldquo;section 1074 of title 34&rdquo;, respectively, on authority of the Act of Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, &sect;49(b), 70A Stat. 640.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(11), the words &ldquo;the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the several States and the District of Columbia&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(14), the words &ldquo;employees necessary for the transaction of the business of the Service at canteens, warehouses, and storage depots whose employment is authorized by section 4202 of title 38&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(23) to &ldquo;positions which are exempt from this chapter, pursuant to section 4202 of title 38&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(16), the reference to &ldquo;section 4114 of title 38&rdquo; is substituted for the reference in former section 1082(25) to &ldquo;section 4114(b) of title 38&rdquo; to reflect <!-- PDFPage:310 -->the pay fixing authority contained in subsection (a)(1) of section 4114.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(22), the words &ldquo;as defined by section 901 of title 20&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as defined in the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act&rdquo; on authority of former section 2351, which is scheduled for transfer to section 901 of title 20.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(25), the word &ldquo;schedule&rdquo; is omitted since section 603 of the Act of Oct. 11, 1962, Pub. L. 87&ndash;793, 76 Stat. 847, eliminated the necessity of referring to rates as scheduled or longevity. The words &ldquo;for GS&ndash;18&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;of the highest grade established by this chapter&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence of subsection (d) is based on former section 1084(c), which is carried into section 5103.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;Title I&mdash;Congressional Findings With Respect to Job Evaluation and Ranking in the Executive Branch</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 101. The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the tremendous growth required in the activities of the Federal Government in order to meet the country's needs during the past several decades has led to the need for employees in an ever-increasing and changing variety of occupations and professions, many of which did not exist when the basic principles of job evaluation and ranking were established by the Classification Act of 1923 [Act Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488]. The diverse and constantly changing nature of these occupations and professions requires that the Federal Government reassess its approach to job evaluation and ranking better to fulfill its role as an employer and assure efficient economical administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the large number and variety of job evaluation and ranking systems in the executive branch have resulted in significant inequities in selection, promotion, and pay of employees in comparable positions among these systems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) little effort has been made by Congress or the executive branch to consolidate or coordinate the various job evaluation and ranking systems, and there has been no progress toward the establishment of a coordinated system in which job evaluation and ranking, regardless of the methods used, is related to a unified set of principles providing coherence and equity throughout the executive branch;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) within the executive branch, there has been no significant study of, or experimentation with the several recognized methods of job evaluation and ranking to determine which of those methods are most appropriate for use and application to meet the present and future needs of the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) notwithstanding the recommendations resulting from the various studies conducted during the last twenty years, the Federal Government has not taken the initiative to implement those recommendations with respect to the job evaluation and ranking systems within the executive branch, with the result that such systems have not, in many cases, been adapted or administered to meet the rapidly changing needs of the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;Title II&mdash;Statement of Policy</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 201. It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the executive branch shall, in the interest of equity, efficiency, and good administration, operate <!-- PDFPage:316 -->under a coordinated job evaluation and ranking system for all civilian positions, to the greatest extent practicable;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the system shall be designed so as to utilize such methods of job evaluation and ranking as are appropriate for use in the executive branch, taking into account the various occupational categories of positions therein; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States Civil Service Commission shall be authorized to exercise general supervision and control over such a system.</p>

The plan shall include, among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) provision for the establishment of a method or methods for evaluating jobs and alining them by level;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) a time schedule for the conversion of existing job evaluation and ranking systems into the coordinated system;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) provision that the Civil Service Commission shall have general supervision of and control over the coordinated job evaluation and ranking system, including, if the Commission deems it appropriate, the authority to approve or disapprove the adoption, use and administration in the executive branch of the method or methods established under that system;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) provision for the establishment of procedures for the periodic review by the Civil Service Commission of the effectiveness of the method or methods adopted for use under the system; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) provision for maintenance of the system to meet the changing needs of the executive branch in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 302. In carrying out its functions under section 301 of this Act, the Commission shall consider all recognized methods of job evaluation and ranking.</p>

The Civil Service Commission is authorized to secure directly from any executive agency, as defined by section 105 of title 5, United States Code, or any bureau, office, or part thereof, information, suggestions, estimates, statistics, and technical assistance for the purposes of this Act; and each such executive agency or bureau, office, or part thereof is authorized and directed to furnish such information, suggestions, estimates, statistics, and technical assistance directly to the Civil Service Commission upon request by the Commission.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Within two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Mar. 17, 1970]&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Civil Service Commission shall complete its functions under this Act and shall transmit to the President a comprehensive report of the result of its activities, together with its recommendations (including its draft of proposed legislation to carry out such recommendations), and</p>
