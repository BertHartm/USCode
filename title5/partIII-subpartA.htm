<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is restated in the form of a definition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(1) is based on former section 638, which placed positions in the executive branch of the Government generally in the competitive service by the requirement that employment be predicated on passing an examination or being exempted from examination, and section 1 of the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I, 54 Stat. 1211 (see table III), which authorized the President, subject to certain exceptions, to place in the classified civil service positions in the Executive departments, independent establishments, and other agencies of the Government. In that Act the word &ldquo;executive&rdquo; has been construed to modify &ldquo;departments&rdquo;, &ldquo;independent establishments&rdquo;; and &ldquo;other agency&rdquo;. This construction is supported by the language of the Act of Jan. 16, 1883, and is embodied in Civil Service Rule I. Acting under this statute, the President has placed all but a comparatively few of the positions covered by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, in the competitive service. The remainder are covered by the exceptions contained in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations. The authority of the President conferred by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, has been superseded in part by exceptions created by statutes enacted after that date. The effect of these exceptions and the power conferred on the President by former section 633(2)8 (last sentence) to make exceptions to the Civil Service Rules are preserved by the words &ldquo;positions which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words &ldquo;or to pass an examination&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the exclusion from the &ldquo;competitive service&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(2) preserves the exception stated in former section 638 modified to recognize the several statutory exceptions to this exception that have been enacted. The language of former section 638 relative to examination is codified in sections 3304(b) and 3361. The reference to veterans&rsquo; preference is omitted because the statute referred to, R.S. &sect;1754, was superseded by sections 3 and 21 of the Act of June 18, 1929, ch. 28, 46 Stat. 21. Section 3 of the Act of June 18, 1929, was superseded by the Act of June 27, 1944, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 387, as amended, which is carried into this title. Rights preserved by section 18 of the Act of June 27, 1944, are further preserved by technical section 8. The exception for laborers and workmen was superseded by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is added because of the provisions in section 3311 of title 39.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is supplied for conformity inasmuch as the terms are coextensive by definition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>

<p class="note-body">1993&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1)(E). Pub. L. 103&ndash;3 added subpar. (E).</p>
<p class="note-body">1990&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 101&ndash;508, &sect;7202(b)(1), amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: &ldquo;laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in section 8332(b)(16) of this title, and sections 5550 and 7204 of this title) administered by the Office of Personnel Management; or&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 101&ndash;508, &sect;7202(b)(2), inserted &ldquo;(except to the extent specifically provided therein)&rdquo; after &ldquo;chapter 84&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1986&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 99&ndash;638 inserted &ldquo;of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in section 8332(b)(16) of this title,&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 99&ndash;335 substituted &ldquo;chapter 81, chapter 84,&rdquo; for &ldquo;chapter 81&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1979&mdash;Subsec. (a)(1)(F). Pub. L. 96&ndash;54, &sect;2(a)(5), substituted &ldquo;an adjutant&rdquo; for &ldquo;the adjutants&rdquo; and struck out &ldquo;,&nbsp;United States Code&rdquo; after &ldquo;32&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 96&ndash;54, &sect;2(a)(6), amended subsec. (c)(1) in same manner as amendment by section 703(c)(2) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;454. See 1978 Amendment note set out below.</p>
<p class="note-body">1978&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 95&ndash;454 substituted &ldquo;7204&rdquo; for &ldquo;7154&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Office of Personnel Management&rdquo; for &ldquo;Civil Service Commission&rdquo;. Amendments by section 703(c)(1) and (c)(2) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;454 appear to have been inadvertently reversed. Subsec. (c)(1) purported to amend subsec. (c)(1) of this section, and subsec. (c)(2) purported to amend section 3302(2) of this title. However, the amendments specified by Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, &sect;703(c)(1) and (2), were impossible to execute literally. Thus, the amendment by Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, &sect;703(c)(2) was executed to this section, and the amendment by section 703(c)(1) was executed to section 3302(2) of this title as the probable intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">1972&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 92&ndash;392 substituted &ldquo;laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 and sections 5550 and 7154 of this title)&rdquo; for &ldquo;laws&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">1970&mdash;Subsec. (e). Pub. L. 91&ndash;375 added subsec. (e).</p>
