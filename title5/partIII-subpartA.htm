<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is restated in the form of a definition.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(1) is based on former section 638, which placed positions in the executive branch of the Government generally in the competitive service by the requirement that employment be predicated on passing an examination or being exempted from examination, and section 1 of the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, ch. 919, title I, 54 Stat. 1211 (see table III), which authorized the President, subject to certain exceptions, to place in the classified civil service positions in the Executive departments, independent establishments, and other agencies of the Government. In that Act the word &ldquo;executive&rdquo; has been construed to modify &ldquo;departments&rdquo;, &ldquo;independent establishments&rdquo;; and &ldquo;other agency&rdquo;. This construction is supported by the language of the Act of Jan. 16, 1883, and is embodied in Civil Service Rule I. Acting under this statute, the President has placed all but a comparatively few of the positions covered by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, in the competitive service. The remainder are covered by the exceptions contained in the Civil Service Rules and Regulations. The authority of the President conferred by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940, has been superseded in part by exceptions created by statutes enacted after that date. The effect of these exceptions and the power conferred on the President by former section 633(2)8 (last sentence) to make exceptions to the Civil Service Rules are preserved by the words &ldquo;positions which are specifically excepted from the competitive service by or under statute&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(B), the words &ldquo;or to pass an examination&rdquo; are omitted as covered by the exclusion from the &ldquo;competitive service&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(2) preserves the exception stated in former section 638 modified to recognize the several statutory exceptions to this exception that have been enacted. The language of former section 638 relative to examination is codified in sections 3304(b) and 3361. The reference to veterans&rsquo; preference is omitted because the statute referred to, R.S. &sect;1754, was superseded by sections 3 and 21 of the Act of June 18, 1929, ch. 28, 46 Stat. 21. Section 3 of the Act of June 18, 1929, was superseded by the Act of June 27, 1944, ch. 287, 58 Stat. 387, as amended, which is carried into this title. Rights preserved by section 18 of the Act of June 27, 1944, are further preserved by technical section 8. The exception for laborers and workmen was superseded by the Act of Nov. 26, 1940.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is added because of the provisions in section 3311 of title 39.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (c) is supplied for conformity inasmuch as the terms are coextensive by definition.</p>

<p class="note-body">1990&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 101&ndash;508, &sect;7202(b)(1), amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: &ldquo;laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in section 8332(b)(16) of this title, and sections 5550 and 7204 of this title) administered by the Office of Personnel Management; or&rdquo;.</p>

Amendments by section 703(c)(1) and (c)(2) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;454 appear to have been inadvertently reversed. Subsec. (c)(1) purported to amend subsec. (c)(1) of this section, and subsec. (c)(2) purported to amend section 3302(2) of this title. However, the amendments specified by Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, &sect;703(c)(1) and (2), were impossible to execute literally. Thus, the amendment by Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, &sect;703(c)(2) was executed to this section, and the amendment by section 703(c)(1) was executed to section 3302(2) of this title as the probable intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">1972&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 92&ndash;392 substituted &ldquo;laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 and sections 5550 and 7154 of this title)&rdquo; for &ldquo;laws&rdquo;.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 101. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Federal agencies cannot be run effectively if those agencies practice or tolerate discrimination;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Congress has heard testimony from individuals, including representatives of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Amer<!-- PDFPage:167 -->ican Federation of Government Employees, that point to chronic problems of discrimination and retaliation against Federal employees;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) in August 2000, a jury found that the Environmental Protection Agency had discriminated against a senior social scientist, and awarded that scientist $600,000;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) in October 2000, an Occupational Safety and Health Administration investigation found that the Environmental Protection Agency had retaliated against a senior scientist for disagreeing with that agency on a matter of science and for helping Congress to carry out its oversight responsibilities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) there have been several recent class action suits based on discrimination brought against Federal agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, the Drug Enforcement Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States Marshals Service, the Department of Agriculture, the United States Information Agency, and the Social Security Administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) notifying Federal employees of their rights under discrimination and whistleblower laws should increase Federal agency compliance with the law;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) requiring annual reports to Congress on the number and severity of discrimination and whistleblower cases brought against each Federal agency should enable Congress to improve its oversight over compliance by agencies with the law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) requiring Federal agencies to pay for any discrimination or whistleblower judgment, award, or settlement should improve agency accountability with respect to discrimination and whistleblower laws.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 102. SENSE OF CONGRESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Federal agencies should not retaliate for court judgments or settlements relating to discrimination and whistleblower laws by targeting the claimant or other employees with reductions in compensation, benefits, or workforce to pay for such judgments or settlements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the mission of the Federal agency and the employment security of employees who are blameless in a whistleblower incident should not be compromised;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Federal agencies should not use a reduction in force or furloughs as means of funding a reimbursement under this Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4)(A) accountability in the enforcement of employee rights is not furthered by terminating&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(i) the employment of other employees; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) the benefits to which those employees are entitled through statute or contract; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) this Act is not intended to authorize those actions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5)(A) nor is accountability furthered if Federal agencies react to the increased accountability under this Act by taking unfounded disciplinary actions against managers or by violating the procedural rights of managers who have been accused of discrimination; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Federal agencies should ensure that managers have adequate training in the management of a diverse workforce and in dispute resolution and other essential communication skills; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6)(A) Federal agencies are expected to reimburse the General Fund of the Treasury within a reasonable time under this Act; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) a Federal agency, particularly if the amount of reimbursement under this Act is large relative to annual appropriations for that agency, may need to extend reimbursement over several years in order to avoid&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(i) reductions in force;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(ii) furloughs;</p>
