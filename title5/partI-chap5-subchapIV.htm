<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) administrative procedure, as embodied in chapter 5 of title 5, United States Code, and other statutes, is intended to offer a prompt, expert, and inexpensive means of resolving disputes as an alternative to litigation in the Federal courts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) administrative proceedings have become increasingly formal, costly, and lengthy resulting in unnecessary expenditures of time and in a decreased likelihood of achieving consensual resolution of disputes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) alternative means of dispute resolution have been used in the private sector for many years and, in appropriate circumstances, have yielded decisions that are faster, less expensive, and less contentious;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) such alternative means can lead to more creative, efficient, and sensible outcomes;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) such alternative means may be used advantageously in a wide variety of administrative programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) explicit authorization of the use of well-tested dispute resolution techniques will eliminate ambiguity of agency authority under existing law;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the availability of a wide range of dispute resolution procedures, and an increased understanding of the most effective use of such procedures, will enhance the operation of the Government and better serve the public.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An agency may use a dispute resolution proceeding for the resolution of an issue in controversy that relates to an administrative program, if the parties agree to such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An agency shall consider not using a dispute resolution proceeding if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value, and such a proceeding is not likely to be accepted generally as an authoritative precedent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of Government policy that require additional procedures before a final resolution may be made, and such a proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy for the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) maintaining established policies is of special importance, so that variations among individual decisions are not increased and such a proceeding would not likely reach consistent results among individual decisions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the matter significantly affects persons or organizations who are not parties to the proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a full public record of the proceeding is important, and a dispute resolution proceeding cannot provide such a record; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the agency must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the matter with authority to alter the disposition of the matter in the light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding would interfere with the agency's fulfilling that requirement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Alternative means of dispute resolution authorized under this subchapter are voluntary procedures which supplement rather than limit other available agency dispute resolution techniques.</p>

Notice shall be provided to all parties to the arbitration proceeding of any request by a party, nonparty participant or other person that the agency head terminate the arbitration proceeding or vacate the award. An employee or agent engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions for an agency may not, in that or a factually related case, advise in a decision under this subsection to terminate an arbitration proceeding or to vacate an arbitral award, except as witness or counsel in public proceedings.&rdquo;</p>
