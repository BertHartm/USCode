<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is supplied to avoid the necessity of defining &ldquo;employee&rdquo; each time it appears in this title.

<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the provisions of the source statutes which relate to credit for prior service and diminution of pay are executed, or, insofar as to be executed preserved by technical section 8.</p>

<p class="note-body">1993&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1)(E). Pub. L. 103&ndash;3 added subpar. (E).</p>
<p class="note-body">1990&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 101&ndash;508, &sect;7202(b)(1), amended par. (1) generally. Prior to amendment, par. (1) read as follows: &ldquo;laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 of this title, subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title to the extent provided in section 8332(b)(16) of this title, and sections 5550 and 7204 of this title) administered by the Office of Personnel Management; or&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsec. (c)(2). Pub. L. 99&ndash;335 substituted &ldquo;chapter 81, chapter 84,&rdquo; for &ldquo;chapter 81&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note-body">1978&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 95&ndash;454 substituted &ldquo;7204&rdquo; for &ldquo;7154&rdquo;, and &ldquo;Office of Personnel Management&rdquo; for &ldquo;Civil Service Commission&rdquo;. Amendments by section 703(c)(1) and (c)(2) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;454 appear to have been inadvertently reversed. Subsec. (c)(1) purported to amend subsec. (c)(1) of this section, and subsec. (c)(2) purported to amend section 3302(2) of this title. However, the amendments specified by Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, &sect;703(c)(1) and (2), were impossible to execute literally. Thus, the amendment by Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, &sect;703(c)(2) was executed to this section, and the amendment by section 703(c)(1) was executed to section 3302(2) of this title as the probable intent of Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">1972&mdash;Subsec. (c)(1). Pub. L. 92&ndash;392 substituted &ldquo;laws (other than subchapter IV of chapter 53 and sections 5550 and 7154 of this title)&rdquo; for &ldquo;laws&rdquo;.</p>
