The words &ldquo;for the employment sought&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter&rdquo; as the latter are archaic since there are no &ldquo;branches&rdquo; within the executive branch.

(a) Upon consideration of the report of the Committee on Civil Service Improvement (House Document No. 118, 77th Congress) appointed by Executive Order No. 8044 of January 31, 1939, it is hereby found and determined that the regulations and procedures hereinafter prescribed in this section with respect to attorney positions in the classified civil service are required by the conditions of good administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) There is hereby created in the Office of Personnel Management (hereinafter referred to as the Office) a board to be known as the Board of Legal Examiners (hereinafter referred to as the Board). The Board shall consist of the Solicitor General of the United States and the chief law officer of the Office of Personnel Management, as members <em>ex officio</em>, and nine members to be appointed by the President, four of whom shall be attorneys chosen from the chief officers of the Executive departments, agencies or corporate instrumentalities of the Government, two from the law-teaching profession, and three from attorneys engaged in private practice.

<p class="note-body">(h) So far as practicable and consistent with good administration, the eligibles on any register for attorney positions and appointments for such register shall be apportioned among the several States and Territories and the District of Columbia upon the basis of population as ascertained in the last preceding census.

<h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.1. Positions and Employees Affected by These Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">These Rules shall apply to all positions in the competitive service and to all incumbents of such positions. Except as expressly provided in the Rule concerned, these Rules shall not apply to positions and employees in the excepted service.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.2. Extent of the Competitive Service</h4>

The Office is authorized and directed to determine finally whether a position is in the competitive service.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.3. Definitions</h4>
<p class="note-body">As used in these Rules:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Competitive service&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as the words &ldquo;classified service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;classified (competitive) service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;classified civil service&rdquo; as defined in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Competitive position&rdquo; shall mean a position in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Competitive status&rdquo; shall mean basic eligibility to be noncompetitively selected to fill a vacancy in a competitive position. A competitive status shall be acquired by career-conditional or career appointment through open competitive examination upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, or may be granted by statute, executive order, or the Civil Service Rules without competitive examination. A person with competitive status may be promoted, transferred, reassigned, reinstated, or demoted without taking an open competitive examination, subject to the conditions prescribed by the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) An employee shall be considered as being in the competitive service when he has a competitive status <!-- PDFPage:204 -->and occupies a competitive position unless he is serving under a temporary appointment: <em>Provided</em>, That an employee who is in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C shall be considered as continuing in the competitive service as long as he continues to occupy such position.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) &ldquo;Tenure&rdquo; shall mean the period of time an employee may reasonably expect to serve under his current appointment. Tenure shall be granted and governed by the type of appointment under which an employee is currently serving without regard to whether he has a competitive status or whether his appointment is to a competitive position or an excepted position.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.4. Extent of the Excepted Service</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) The excepted service shall include all civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government which are specifically excepted from the requirements of the Civil Service Act or from the competitive service by or pursuant to statute or by the Office under section 6.1 of Rule VI.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Excepted service&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as the words &ldquo;unclassified service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unclassified civil service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;positions outside the competitive civil service&rdquo; as used in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Excepted position&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as &ldquo;unclassified position&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by law&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by executive order&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by Civil Service Rule&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position outside the competitive service&rdquo; as used in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Rule II&mdash;Appointment Through the Competitive System</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.1. Competitive Examinations and Eligible Registers</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Office shall be responsible for open competitive examinations for admission to the competitive service which will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined for the position to be filled. The Office is authorized to establish standards with respect to citizenship, age, education, training and experience, suitability, and physical and mental fitness, and for residence or other requirements which applicants must meet to be admitted to or rated in examinations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In addition to the names of persons who qualify in competitive examinations, the names of persons who have lost eligibility on a career or career-conditional register because of service in the armed forces, and the names of persons who lost opportunity for certification or who have served under career or career-conditional appointment when the Office determines that they should be given certification, may also be entered at such places on appropriate registers and under such conditions as the Office may prescribe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Whenever the Office of Personnel Management (1) is unable to certify a sufficient number of names to permit the appointing officer to consider three eligibles for appointment to a fourth-class postmaster position in accordance with the regular procedure, or (2) finds that a particular rate of compensation for fourth-class postmaster positions is too low to warrant regular competitive examinations for such positions, it may authorize appointment to any such position or positions in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed by the Office. Persons appointed under this subsection may acquire competitive status subject to satisfactory completion of a probationary period prescribed by the Office.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.2. Appointments</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Office shall establish and administer a career-conditional appointment system for positions subject to competitive examination which will permit adjustment of the career service to necessary fluctuations in Federal employment, and provide an equitable and orderly system for stabilizing the Federal work force. A competitive status shall be acquired by a career-conditional appointee upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, but the appointee shall have career-conditional tenure for a period of service to be prescribed by regulation of the Office. When an employee has completed the required period of service his appointment shall be converted to a career appointment without time limitation: <em>Provided</em>, That his career-conditional appointment shall not be converted to a career appointment if the limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service established under subsection (b) of this section would be exceeded thereby. Persons selected from competitive civil service registers for other than temporary appointment shall be given career-conditional appointments: <em>Provided</em>, That career appointments shall be given to the following classes of eligibles: (1) Persons whose appointments are required by statute to be made on a permanent basis; (2) employees serving under career appointments at the time of selections from such registers; (3) former employees who have eligibility for career appointments upon reinstatement; and (4) to the extent permitted by law, persons appointed to positions in the field service of the Post Office Department for which salary rates are fixed by the act of July 6, 1945, 59 Stat. 435, as heretofore or hereafter amended and supplemented.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Under the career-conditional appointment system there shall be a limit on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service which shall be the ceiling established by section 1310 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1952 (65 Stat. 757), as amended [set out as a note under section 3101 of this title]. In the event section 1310, supra, is repealed, the Office is authorized to fix such limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service as it finds necessary to meet the needs of the service.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Office may determine the types, duration, and conditions of indefinite and temporary appointments, and may prescribe the method for replacing persons holding such appointments.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.3. Apportionment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subject to such modifications as the Office finds to be necessary in the interest of good administration, appointments to positions in agencies&rsquo; headquarters offices which are located within the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C., shall be made so as to maintain the apportionment of appointments among the several States, Territories, and the District of Columbia upon the basis of population.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.4. Probationary Period</h4>
<p class="note-body">Persons selected from registers of eligibles for career or career-conditional appointment and employees promoted, transferred, or otherwise assigned, for the first time, to supervisory or managerial positions shall be required to serve a probationary period under terms and conditions prescribed by the Office.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Rule III&mdash;Noncompetitive Acquisition of Status</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.1. Classes of Persons Who May Noncompetitively Acquire Status</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) Upon recommendation by the agency concerned, and subject to such noncompetitive examination, time limits, or other requirements as the Office may prescribe, the following classes of persons may acquire a competitive status without competitive examination:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A person holding a permanent position when it is placed in the competitive service by statute or executive order or is otherwise made subject to competitive examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A disabled veteran who, in a manner satisfactory to the Office, has completed a course of training in the executive branch of the Government prescribed by the Administrator of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs in accordance with the act of March 24, 1943, 57 Stat. 43.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:205 --><p class="note-body">(3) An employee who has served at least two years in the immediate office of the President or on the White House Staff and who is transferred to a competitive position at the request of an agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) An employee who was serving when his name was reached for certification on a civil-service register appropriate for the position in which he was serving: <em>Provided</em>, That the recommendation for competitive status is made prior to expiration of the register on which his name appears or is made during a period of continuous service since his name was reached: <em>Provided further</em>, That the register was being used for appointments conferring competitive status at the time his name was reached.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Upon recommendation by the employing agency, and subject to such requirements as the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, the following classes of handicapped employees may acquire competitive status without competitive examination:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A severely physically handicapped employee who completes at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.2. Appointments Without Competitive Examination in Rare Cases</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of the qualifications of the person to be appointed, the Office may authorize an appointment in the competitive service without competitive examination whenever it finds that the duties or compensation of the position are such, or that qualified persons are so rare, that, in the interest of good civil-service administration, the position cannot be filled through open competitive examination. Any person heretofore or hereafter appointed under this section shall acquire a competitive status upon completion of at least one year of satisfactory service and compliance with such requirements as the Office may prescribe. Detailed statements of the reasons for the noncompetitive appointments made under this section shall be published in the Office's annual reports.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.3. Conversion of Appointments</h4>
<p class="note-body">Any person who acquires a competitive status under this Rule shall have his appointment converted to career-conditional appointment unless he meets the service requirement for career appointment prescribed under section 2.2 (a) of Rule II.</p>

All disclosures concerning such matters shall be ignored, except as to such membership in political parties or organizations as constitutes by law a disqualification for Government employment. No discrimination shall be exercised, threatened, or promised by any person in the executive branch of the Federal Government against or in favor of any employee in the competitive service, or any eligible or applicant for a position in the competitive service because of his race, political affiliation or religious beliefs, except as may be authorized or required by law.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and in order to give individuals with psychiatric disabilities the same hiring opportunities as persons with severe physical disabilities or mental retardation under the Civil Service Rules, and to permit individuals with psychiatric disabilities to obtain Civil Service competitive status, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) It is the policy of the United States to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for persons with disabilities. The Federal Government as an employer should serve as a model for the employment of persons with disabilities and utilize the full potential of these talented citizens.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Civil Service Rules governing appointment of persons with psychiatric disabilities were adopted years ago when attitudes about mental illness were different than they are today, which led to stricter standards for hiring persons with psychiatric disabilities than for persons with mental retardation or severe physical disabilities. The Civil Service Rules provide that persons with mental retardation, severe physical disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities may be hired under excepted appointing authorities. While persons with mental retardation or severe physical disabilities may be appointed for more than 2 years and may convert to competitive status after completion of 2 years of satisfactory service in their excepted position, people with psychiatric disabilities may not.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the President's Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities believe that the Federal Government could better benefit from the contributions of persons with psychiatric disabilities if they were given the same opportunities available to people with mental retardation or severe physical disabilities.</p>

<p class="note-body">(a) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall, consistent with OPM authority, provide that persons with psychiatric disabilities are subject to the same hiring rules as persons with mental retardation or severe physical disabilities.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(4) Competitive civil service status may be granted to a Career Intern who satisfactorily completes the internship and meets all other requirements prescribed by the OPM.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(5) Within an agency, an employee who formerly held a career or career-conditional appointment immediately before entering the Career Intern Program, and who fails to complete the Career Intern Program for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability, shall be placed in a career or career-conditional position in the current agency at no lower grade or pay than the one the employee left to accept the position in the Career Intern Program.</p>

<p class="note-body">The reference to the competitive service is substituted for the reference to the Act creating that service. The reference to reasons for the exceptions is omitted as covered by section 1308 of this title. The words &ldquo;provide for&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;provide and declare&rdquo;. Paragraph (1) is supplied to preserve the President's power to except positions from the competitive service, previously implied from the power to except from the first rule in former section 633(2). Authority to make exceptions to so much of former section 633(2) as is restated in this section and section 1302(a) is omitted as meaningless. Authority to make exceptions to so much of former section 633(2) as is restated in section 3318(a) is omitted as superseded by former section 857, which is carried into section 3318(a). In the last sentence, the words &ldquo;Each officer and individual employed in an agency&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;officers of the United States in the departments and offices&rdquo; because of the restrictive definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 2104.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) An individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title. This subsection does not take from the President any authority conferred by section 3301 of this title that is consistent with the provisions of this title governing the competitive service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For the purpose of this subsection, the term &ldquo;technician&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 8337(h)(1) of this title.</p>

The regulations shall be consistent with the principles of equitable competition and merit based appointments.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Employees at any place outside the District of Columbia where the President or the Office of Personnel Management directs that examinations be held shall allow the reasonable use of public buildings for, and in all proper ways facilitate, holding the examinations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If selected, a preference eligible or veteran described in paragraph (1) shall receive a career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate.</p>

The regulations shall ensure that an individual who has completed an initial tour of active duty is not excluded from the application of this subsection because of having been released from such tour of duty shortly before completing 3 years of active service, having been honorably released from such duty.</p>

An individual separated on account of age under a statute or regulation providing for retirement on account of age is not eligible for appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia. The President, when in his judgment the public interest so requires, may except an individual from this subsection by Executive order. This subsection does not apply to an individual named by a statute providing for the continuance of the individual in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia.</p>

An annuitant so reemployed, other than an annuitant reappointed under paragraph (2) of this subsection, serves at the will of the appointing authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to such regulations as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, any annuitant to whom the first sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection applies and who has served as an administrative law judge pursuant to an appointment under section 3105 of this title may be reappointed an administrative law judge under such section for a specified period or for such period as may be necessary for such administrative law judge to conduct and complete the hearing and disposition of one or <!-- PDFPage:229 -->more specified cases. The provisions of this title that apply to or with respect to administrative law judges appointed under section 3105 of this title shall apply to or with respect to administrative law judges reappointed under such section pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.</p>

An annuitant so reemployed serves at the will of the appointing authority.</p>
