<!-- PDFPage:97 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a report on such rule were submitted to Congress under subsection (a)(1) on such date.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The effectiveness of a rule described under paragraph (1) shall be as otherwise provided by law, unless the rule is made of no force or effect under section 802.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any rule that takes effect and later is made of no force or effect by enactment of a joint resolution under section 802 shall be treated as though such rule had never taken effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If the Congress does not enact a joint resolution of disapproval under section 802 respecting a rule, no court or agency may infer any intent of the Congress from any action or inaction of the Congress with regard to such rule, related statute, or joint resolution of disapproval.</p>
