<p class="note-body">(b) There is hereby created in the Office of Personnel Management (hereinafter referred to as the Office) a board to be known as the Board of Legal Examiners (hereinafter referred to as the Board). The Board shall consist of the Solicitor General of the United States and the chief law officer of the Office of Personnel Management, as members <em>ex officio</em>, and nine members to be appointed by the President, four of whom shall be attorneys chosen from the chief officers of the Executive departments, agencies or corporate instrumentalities <!-- PDFPage:199 -->of the Government, two from the law-teaching profession, and three from attorneys engaged in private practice.

The Office is authorized and directed to determine finally whether a position is in the competitive service.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.3. Definitions</h4>
<p class="note-body">As used in these Rules:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Competitive service&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as the words &ldquo;classified service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;classified (competitive) service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;classified civil service&rdquo; as defined in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Competitive position&rdquo; shall mean a position in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Competitive status&rdquo; shall mean basic eligibility to be noncompetitively selected to fill a vacancy in a competitive position. A competitive status shall be acquired by career-conditional or career appointment through open competitive examination upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, or may be granted by statute, executive order, or the Civil Service Rules without competitive examination. A person with competitive status may be promoted, transferred, reassigned, reinstated, or demoted without taking an open competitive examination, subject to the conditions prescribed by the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) An employee shall be considered as being in the competitive service when he has a competitive status and occupies a competitive position unless he is serving under a temporary appointment: <em>Provided</em>, That an employee who is in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C shall be considered as continuing in the competitive service as long as he continues to occupy such position.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) &ldquo;Tenure&rdquo; shall mean the period of time an employee may reasonably expect to serve under his current appointment. Tenure shall be granted and governed by the type of appointment under which an employee is currently serving without regard to whether he has a competitive status or whether his appointment is to a competitive position or an excepted position.</p>

<p class="note-body">(a) The excepted service shall include all civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government which are specifically excepted from the requirements of the Civil Service Act or from the competitive service by or pursuant to statute or by the Office under section 6.1 of Rule VI.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Excepted service&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as the words &ldquo;unclassified service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unclassified civil service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;positions outside the competitive civil service&rdquo; as used in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Excepted position&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as &ldquo;unclassified position&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by law&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by executive order&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by Civil Service Rule&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position outside the competitive service&rdquo; as used in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Rule II&mdash;Appointment Through the Competitive System</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.1. Competitive Examinations and Eligible Registers</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Office shall be responsible for open competitive examinations for admission to the competitive service which will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined for the position to be filled. The Office is authorized to establish standards with respect to citizenship, age, education, training and experience, suitability, and physical and mental fitness, and for residence or other requirements which applicants must meet to be admitted to or rated in examinations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In addition to the names of persons who qualify in competitive examinations, the names of persons who have lost eligibility on a career or career-conditional register because of service in the armed forces, and the names of persons who lost opportunity for certification or who have served under career or career-conditional appointment when the Office determines that they should be given certification, may also be entered at such places on appropriate registers and under such conditions as the Office may prescribe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Whenever the Office of Personnel Management (1) is unable to certify a sufficient number of names to permit the appointing officer to consider three eligibles for appointment to a fourth-class postmaster position in accordance with the regular procedure, or (2) finds that a particular rate of compensation for fourth-class postmaster positions is too low to warrant regular competitive examinations for such positions, it may authorize appointment to any such position or positions in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed by the Office. Persons appointed under this subsection may acquire competitive status subject to satisfactory completion of a probationary period prescribed by the Office.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.2. Appointments</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Office shall establish and administer a career-conditional appointment system for positions subject to competitive examination which will permit adjustment of the career service to necessary fluctuations in Federal employment, and provide an equitable and orderly system for stabilizing the Federal work force. A competitive status shall be acquired by a career-conditional appointee upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, but the appointee shall have career-conditional tenure for a period of service to be prescribed by regulation of the Office. When an employee has completed the required period of service his appointment shall be converted to a career appointment without time limitation: <em>Provided</em>, That his career-con<!-- PDFPage:201 -->ditional appointment shall not be converted to a career appointment if the limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service established under subsection (b) of this section would be exceeded thereby. Persons selected from competitive civil service registers for other than temporary appointment shall be given career-conditional appointments: <em>Provided</em>, That career appointments shall be given to the following classes of eligibles: (1) Persons whose appointments are required by statute to be made on a permanent basis; (2) employees serving under career appointments at the time of selections from such registers; (3) former employees who have eligibility for career appointments upon reinstatement; and (4) to the extent permitted by law, persons appointed to positions in the field service of the Post Office Department for which salary rates are fixed by the act of July 6, 1945, 59 Stat. 435, as heretofore or hereafter amended and supplemented.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Under the career-conditional appointment system there shall be a limit on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service which shall be the ceiling established by section 1310 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1952 (65 Stat. 757), as amended [set out as a note under section 3101 of this title]. In the event section 1310, supra, is repealed, the Office is authorized to fix such limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service as it finds necessary to meet the needs of the service.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Office may determine the types, duration, and conditions of indefinite and temporary appointments, and may prescribe the method for replacing persons holding such appointments.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.3. Apportionment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subject to such modifications as the Office finds to be necessary in the interest of good administration, appointments to positions in agencies&rsquo; headquarters offices which are located within the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C., shall be made so as to maintain the apportionment of appointments among the several States, Territories, and the District of Columbia upon the basis of population.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.4. Probationary Period</h4>
<p class="note-body">Persons selected from registers of eligibles for career or career-conditional appointment and employees promoted, transferred, or otherwise assigned, for the first time, to supervisory or managerial positions shall be required to serve a probationary period under terms and conditions prescribed by the Office.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Rule III&mdash;Noncompetitive Acquisition of Status</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.1. Classes of Persons Who May Noncompetitively Acquire Status</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) Upon recommendation by the agency concerned, and subject to such noncompetitive examination, time limits, or other requirements as the Office may prescribe, the following classes of persons may acquire a competitive status without competitive examination:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A person holding a permanent position when it is placed in the competitive service by statute or executive order or is otherwise made subject to competitive examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A disabled veteran who, in a manner satisfactory to the Office, has completed a course of training in the executive branch of the Government prescribed by the Administrator of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs in accordance with the act of March 24, 1943, 57 Stat. 43.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) An employee who has served at least two years in the immediate office of the President or on the White House Staff and who is transferred to a competitive position at the request of an agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) An employee who was serving when his name was reached for certification on a civil-service register appropriate for the position in which he was serving: <em>Provided</em>, That the recommendation for competitive status is made prior to expiration of the register on which his name appears or is made during a period of continuous service since his name was reached: <em>Provided further</em>, That the register was being used for appointments conferring competitive status at the time his name was reached.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Upon recommendation by the employing agency, and subject to such requirements as the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, the following classes of handicapped employees may acquire competitive status without competitive examination:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A severely physically handicapped employee who completes at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.2. Appointments Without Competitive Examination in Rare Cases</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of the qualifications of the person to be appointed, the Office may authorize an appointment in the competitive service without competitive examination whenever it finds that the duties or compensation of the position are such, or that qualified persons are so rare, that, in the interest of good civil-service administration, the position cannot be filled through open competitive examination. Any person heretofore or hereafter appointed under this section shall acquire a competitive status upon completion of at least one year of satisfactory service and compliance with such requirements as the Office may prescribe. Detailed statements of the reasons for the noncompetitive appointments made under this section shall be published in the Office's annual reports.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.3. Conversion of Appointments</h4>

All disclosures concerning such matters shall be ignored, except as to such membership in political parties or organizations as constitutes by law a disqualification for Government employment. No discrimination shall be exercised, threatened, or promised by any person in the executive branch of the Federal Government against or in favor of any employee in the competitive service, or any eligible or applicant for a position in the competitive service because of his race, political affiliation or religious beliefs, except as may be authorized or required by law.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5, United States Code, and in order to give individuals with psychiatric disabilities the same hiring opportunities as persons with severe physical disabilities or mental retardation under the Civil Service Rules, and to permit individuals with psychiatric disabilities to obtain Civil Service competitive status, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) It is the policy of the United States to assure equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency for persons with disabilities. The Federal Government as an employer should serve as a model for the employment of persons with disabilities and utilize the full potential of these talented citizens.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:212 --><p class="note-body">(b) The Civil Service Rules governing appointment of persons with psychiatric disabilities were adopted years ago when attitudes about mental illness were different than they are today, which led to stricter standards for hiring persons with psychiatric disabilities than for persons with mental retardation or severe physical disabilities. The Civil Service Rules provide that persons with mental retardation, severe physical disabilities, or psychiatric disabilities may be hired under excepted appointing authorities. While persons with mental retardation or severe physical disabilities may be appointed for more than 2 years and may convert to competitive status after completion of 2 years of satisfactory service in their excepted position, people with psychiatric disabilities may not.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and the President's Task Force on Employment of Adults with Disabilities believe that the Federal Government could better benefit from the contributions of persons with psychiatric disabilities if they were given the same opportunities available to people with mental retardation or severe physical disabilities.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(5) Within an agency, an employee who formerly held a career or career-conditional appointment immediately before entering the Career Intern Program, and who fails to complete the Career Intern Program for reasons unrelated to misconduct or suitability, shall be placed in a career or career-conditional position in the current agency at no lower grade or pay than the one the employee left to accept the position in the Career Intern Program.</p>

<p class="note-body">The reference to the competitive service is substituted for the reference to the Act creating that service. The reference to reasons for the exceptions is omitted as covered by section 1308 of this title. The words &ldquo;provide for&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;provide and declare&rdquo;. Paragraph (1) is supplied to preserve the President's power to except positions from the competitive service, previously implied from the power to except from the first rule in former section 633(2). Authority to make exceptions to so much of former section 633(2) as is restated in this section and section 1302(a) is omitted as meaningless.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) noncompetitive examinations when competent applicants do not compete after notice has been given of the existence of the vacancy; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The Office shall prescribe, by regulation, criteria for identifying such positions and may delegate authority to make determinations under such criteria.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An individual may be appointed in the competitive service only if he has passed an examination or is specifically excepted from examination under section 3302 of this title. This subsection does not take from the President any authority conferred by section 3301 of this title that is consistent with the provisions of this title governing the competitive service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) For the purpose of this subsection, the term &ldquo;technician&rdquo; has the meaning given such term by section 8337(h)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding a contrary provision of this title or of the rules and regulations prescribed under this title for the administration of the competitive service, an individual who served for at least 3 years as a technician acquires a competitive status for transfer to the competitive service if such individual&mdash;</p>

In promulgating such regulations OPM shall not grant any preference based on the fact of service in the legislative or judicial branch. The regulations shall be consistent with the principles of equitable competition and merit based appointments.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) If selected, a preference eligible or veteran described in paragraph (1) shall receive a career or career-conditional appointment, as appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations necessary for the administration of this subsection. The regulations shall ensure that an individual who has completed an initial tour of active duty is not excluded from the application of this subsection because of having been released from such tour of duty shortly before completing 3 years of active service, having been honorably released from such duty.</p>

An individual separated on account of age under a statute or regulation providing for retirement on account of age is not eligible for appointment in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia. The President, when in his judgment the public interest so requires, may except an individual from this subsection by Executive order. This subsection does not apply to an individual named by a statute providing for the continuance of the individual in the civil service or in the government of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding other statutes, an annuitant, as defined by section 8331 or 8401, receiving annuity from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in an appointive position for which the annuitant is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed, other than an annuitant reappointed under paragraph (2) of this subsection, serves at the will of the appointing authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to such regulations as the Director of the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, any annuitant to whom the first sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection applies and who has served as an administrative law judge pursuant to an appointment under section 3105 of this title may be reappointed an administrative law judge under such section for a specified period or for such period as may be necessary for such administrative law judge to conduct and complete the hearing and disposition of one or more specified cases. The provisions of this title that apply to or with respect to administrative law judges appointed under section 3105 of this title shall apply to or with respect to administrative law judges reappointed under such section pursuant to the first sentence of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a member of the Foreign Service retired under section 812 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980 is not barred by reason of his retired status from employment in a position in the civil service for which he is qualified. An annuitant so reemployed serves at the will of the appointing authority.</p>

<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Executive department&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;department&rdquo; as the definition of &ldquo;department&rdquo; applicable to this section is coextensive with the definition of &ldquo;Executive department&rdquo; in section 101.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;or military department&rdquo; are inserted to preserve the application of the source law.

However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) On request from or with the concurrence of a State or local government, and with the consent of the employee concerned, the head of a Federal agency may arrange for the assignment of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an employee of his agency, other than a noncareer appointee, limited term appointee, or limited emergency appointee (as such terms are defined in section 3132(a) of this title) in the Senior Executive Service and an employee in a position which has been excepted from the competitive service by reason of its confidential, policy-determining, policy-making, or policy-advocating character, to a State or local government; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an employee of a State or local government to his agency;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">for work of mutual concern to his agency and the State or local government that he determines will be beneficial to both. The period of an assignment under this subchapter may not exceed two years. However, the head of a Federal agency may extend the period of assignment for not more than two additional years. In the case of assignments made to Indian tribes or tribal organizations as defined in section 3371(2)(C) of this subchapter, the head of an executive agency may extend the period of assignment for any period of time where it is determined that this will continue to benefit both the executive agency and the Indian tribe or tribal organization. If the assigned employee fails to complete the period of assignment and there is another employee willing and available to do so, the Secretary may assign the employee to complete the period of assignment and may execute an agreement with the tribal organization with respect to the replacement employee. That agreement may provide for a different period of assignment as may be agreed to by the Secretary and the tribal organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) This subchapter is authority for and applies to the assignment of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an employee of a Federal agency to an institution of higher education;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an employee of an institution of higher education to a Federal agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an employee of a Federal agency to any other organization; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an employee of an other organization to a Federal agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) An employee of a Federal agency may be assigned under this subchapter only if the employee agrees, as a condition of accepting an assignment under this subchapter, to serve in the civil service upon the completion of the assignment for a period equal to the length of the assignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each agreement required under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall provide that in the event the employee fails to carry out the agreement (except for good and sufficient reason, as determined by the head of the Federal agency from which assigned) the employee shall be liable to the United States for payment of all expenses (excluding salary) of the assignment. The amount shall be treated as a debt due the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Where the employee is assigned to a tribal organization, the employee shall be eligible for promotions, periodic step-increases, and additional step-increases, as defined in chapter 53 of this title, on the same basis as other Federal employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Under regulations prescribed pursuant to section 3376 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an assignment of an employee of a Federal agency to an other organization or an institution of higher education, and an employee so assigned, shall be treated in the same way as an assignment of an employee of a Federal agency to a State or local government, and an employee so assigned, is treated under the provisions of this subchapter governing an assignment of an employee of a Federal agency to a State or local government, except that the rate of pay of an employee assigned to a federally funded research and development center may not exceed the rate of pay that such employee would be paid for continued service in the position in the Federal agency from which assigned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an assignment of an employee of an other organization or an institution of higher education to a Federal agency, and an employee so assigned, shall be treated in the same way as an assignment of an employee of a State or local government to a Federal agency, and an employee so assigned, is treated under the provisions of this subchapter governing an assignment of an employee of a State or local government to a Federal agency.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;3373. Assignment of employees to State or local governments</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An employee of a Federal agency assigned to a State or local government under this subchapter is deemed, during the assignment, to be either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) on detail to a regular work assignment in his agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) on leave without pay from his position in the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An employee assigned either on detail or on leave without pay remains an employee of his agency. The Federal Tort Claims Act and any other Federal tort liability statute apply to an employee so assigned. The supervision of the duties of an employee on detail may be governed by agreement between the Federal agency and the State or local government concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The assignment of an employee of a Federal agency either on detail or on leave without pay to a State or local government under this subchapter may be made with or without reimbursement by the State or local government for the travel and transportation expenses to or from the place of assignment and for the pay, or supplemental pay, or a part thereof, of the employee during assignment. Any reimbursements shall be credited to the appropriation of the Federal agency used for paying the travel and transportation expenses or pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) For any employee so assigned and on leave without pay&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the rate of pay for his employment by the State or local government is less than the rate of pay he would have received had he continued in his regular assignment in the agency, he is entitled to receive supplemental pay from the agency in an amount equal to the difference between the State or local government rate and the agency rate;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) he is entitled to annual and sick leave to the same extent as if he had continued in his regular assignment in the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) he is entitled, notwithstanding other statutes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to continuation of his insurance under chapter 87 of this title, and coverage under chapter 89 of this title or other applicable authority, so long as he pays currently into the Employee's Life Insurance Fund and the Employee's Health Benefits Fund or other applicable health benefits system (through his employing agency) the amount of the employee contributions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to credit the period of his assignment under this subchapter toward periodic step-increases, retention, and leave accrual purposes, and, on payment into the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund or other applicable retirement system of the percentage of his State or local government pay, and of his supplemental pay, if any, that would have been deducted from a like agency pay for the period of the assignment and payment by the Federal agency into the fund or system of the amount that would have been payable by the agency during the period of the assignment with respect to a like agency pay, to treat his service during that period as service of the type performed in the agency immediately before his assignment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for the purpose of subchapter I of chapter 85 of this title, to credit the service performed during the period of his assignment under this subchapter as Federal service, and to consider his State or local government pay (and his supplemental pay, if any) as Federal wages. To the extent that the service could also be the basis for entitlement to unemployment compensation under a State law, the employee may elect to claim unemployment compensation on the basis of the service under either the State law or subchapter I of chapter 85 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">However, an employee or his beneficiary may not receive benefits referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (3), based on service during an assignment under this subchapter for which the employee or, if he dies without making such an election, his beneficiary elects to receive benefits, under any State or local gov<!-- PDFPage:249 -->ernment retirement or insurance law or program, which the Office of Personnel Management determines to be similar. The Federal agency shall deposit currently in the Employee's Life Insurance Fund, the Employee's Health Benefits Fund or other applicable health benefits system, respectively, the amount of the Government's contributions on account of service with respect to which employee contributions are collected as provided in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) An employee so assigned and on leave without pay who dies or suffers disability as a result of personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty during an assignment under this subchapter shall be treated, for the purpose of subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title, as though he were an employee as defined by section 8101 of this title who had sustained the injury in the performance of duty. When an employee (or his dependents in case of death) entitled by reason of injury or death to benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title is also entitled to benefits from a State or local government for the same injury or death, he (or his dependents in case of death) shall elect which benefits he will receive. The election shall be made within one year after the injury or death, or such further time as the Secretary of Labor may allow for reasonable cause shown. When made, the election is irrevocable unless otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee who elects to receive benefits from a State or local government may not receive an annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title and benefits from the State or local government for injury or disability to himself covering the same period of time. This provision does not&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either the State or local government or subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title for any part of the same period of time;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) deny to an employee an annuity accruing to him under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title on account of service performed by him; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) deny any concurrent benefit to him from the State or local government on account of the death of another individual.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) An employee of a State or local government who is assigned to a Federal agency under an arrangement under this subchapter may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) be appointed in the Federal agency without regard to the provisions of this title governing appointment in the competitive service for the agreed period of the assignment; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be deemed on detail to the Federal agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An employee given an appointment is entitled to pay in accordance with chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title or other applicable law, and is deemed an employee of the Federal agency for all purposes except&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) chapter 87 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) chapter 89 of this title or other applicable health benefits system unless his appointment results in the loss of coverage in a group health benefits plan the premium of which has been paid in whole or in part by a State or local government contribution.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The above exceptions shall not apply to non-Federal employees who are covered by chapters 83, 87, and 89 of this title by virtue of their non-Federal employment immediately before assignment and appointment under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) During the period of assignment, a State or local government employee on detail to a Federal agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not entitled to pay from the agency, except to the extent that the pay received from the State or local government is less than the appropriate rate of pay which the duties would warrant under the applicable pay provisions of this title or other applicable authority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is deemed an employee of the agency for the purpose of chapter 73 of this title, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, section 27 of the Office of Federal Procurement Policy Act, sections 203, 205, 207, 208, 209, 602, 603, 606, 607, 643, 654, 1905, and 1913 of title 18, sections 1343, 1344, and 1349(b) of title 31, and the Federal Tort Claims Act and any other Federal tort liability statute; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is subject to such regulations as the President may prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The supervision of the duties of such an employee may be governed by agreement between the Federal agency and the State or local government concerned. A detail of a State or local government employee to a Federal agency may be made with or without reimbursement by the Federal agency for the pay, or a part thereof, of the employee during the period of assignment, or for the contribution of the State or local government, or a part thereof, to employee benefit systems.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A State or local government employee who is given an appointment in a Federal agency for <!-- PDFPage:250 -->the period of the assignment or who is on detail to a Federal agency and who suffers disability or dies as a result of personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty during the assignment shall be treated, for the purpose of subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title, as though he were an employee as defined by section 8101 of this title who had sustained the injury in the performance of duty. When an employee (or his dependents in case of death) entitled by reason of injury or death to benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title is also entitled to benefits from a State or local government for the same injury or death, he (or his dependents in case of death) shall elect which benefits he will receive. The election shall be made within 1 year after the injury or death, or such further time as the Secretary of Labor may allow for reasonable cause shown. When made, the election is irrevocable unless otherwise provided by law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If a State or local government fails to continue the employer's contribution to State or local government retirement, life insurance, and health benefit plans for a State or local government employee who is given an appointment in a Federal agency, the employer's contributions covering the State or local government employee's period of assignment, or any part thereof, may be made from the appropriations of the Federal agency concerned.</p>
