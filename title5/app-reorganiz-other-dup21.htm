<p class="note-body-flush0_hang1">Prepared by the President and transmitted to the Senate and the House of Representatives in Congress assembled, March 13, 1950, pursuant to the provisions of the Reorganization Act of 1949, approved June 20, 1949 [see 5 U.S.C. 901 et seq.].</p>
<h4 class="reorganizationplan-subhead">DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">Section 1. Transfer of Functions to the Secretary</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b) of this section, there are hereby transferred to the Secretary of the Interior all functions of all other officers of the Department of the Interior and all functions of all agencies and employees of such Department.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) This section shall not apply to the functions vested by the Administrative Procedure Act (60 Stat. 237) [see 5 U.S.C. 551 et seq. and 701 et seq.] in hearing examiners employed by the Department of the Interior, nor to the functions of the Virgin Islands Corporation or of its Board of Directors or officers.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 2. Performance of Functions of Secretary</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Secretary of the Interior may from time to time make such provisions as he shall deem appropriate authorizing the performance by any other officer, or by any agency or employee, of the Department of the Interior of any function of the Secretary, including any function transferred to the Secretary by the provisions of this reorganization plan.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 3. Assistant Secretary of the Interior</h4>
<p class="note-body">There shall be in the Department of the Interior one additional Assistant Secretary of the Interior, who shall be appointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, who shall perform such duties as the Secretary of the Interior shall prescribe, and who shall receive compensation at the rate prescribed by law for Assistant Secretaries of executive departments.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 4. Administrative Assistant Secretary</h4>
<p class="note-body">[Repealed. Pub. L. 92&ndash;22, &sect;3, June 1, 1971, 85 Stat. 76. Section authorized appointment of Administrative Assistant Secretary of Interior. See 43 U.S.C. 1453a and 5 U.S.C. 5315.

<h4 class="note-head">Sec. 5. Incidental Transfers</h4>
<p class="note-body">The Secretary of the Interior may from time to time effect such transfers within the Department of the Interior of any of the records, property, personnel, and unexpended balances (available or to be made available) of appropriations, allocations, and other funds of such Department as he may deem necessary in order to carry out the provisions of this reorganization plan.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Message of the President</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">I transmit herewith Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1950, prepared in accordance with the Reorganization Act of 1949 and providing for reorganizations in the Department of the Interior. My reasons for transmitting this plan are stated in an accompanying general message.</p>
<p class="note-body">After investigation I have found and hereby declare that each reorganization included in Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1950 is necessary to accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in section 2(a) of the Reorganization Act of 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">I have found and hereby declare that it is necessary to include in the accompanying reorganization plan, by reason of reorganizations made thereby, provisions for the appointment and compensation of an Assistant Secretary of the Interior and an Administrative Assistant Secretary of the Interior. The rate of compensation fixed for these officers is that which I have found to prevail in respect of comparable officers in the executive branch of the Government.</p>
<p class="note-body">The taking effect of the reorganizations included in this plan may not in itself result in substantial immediate savings. However, many benefits in improved operations are probable during the next years which will result in a reduction in expenditures as compared with those that would be otherwise necessary. An itemization of these reductions in advance of actual experience under this plan is not practicable.</p>
