<p class="note-body">The section is reorganized and restated for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(i), the exception of &ldquo;a Government controlled corporation&rdquo; is added to preserve the application of this chapter to &ldquo;corporations wholly owned by the United States&rdquo;. This is necessary as the defined term &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; includes the defined term &ldquo;Government corporation&rdquo; and the latter includes both Government owned and controlled corporations. Thus the exclusion of Government controlled corporations, which are distinct from wholly owned corporations, operates to preserve the application of the chapter to wholly owned corporations.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(vii), the words &ldquo;Panama Canal Company&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Panama Railroad Company&rdquo; on authority of the Act of Sept. 26, 1950, ch. 1049, &sect;2(a)(2), 64 Stat. 1038.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception for the Inland Waterways Corporation in former section 1082(13) is omitted on authority of the Act of July 19, 1963, Pub. L. 88&ndash;67, 77 Stat. 81.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exceptions for Production Credit Corporations and Federal Intermediate Credit Banks in former section 1082(18) and (19) are omitted as they are no longer &ldquo;corporations wholly owned by the United States&rdquo;. Under the Farm Credit Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 659, the Production Credit Corporations were merged in the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, and pursuant to that Act the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks have ceased to be corporations wholly owned by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(2) is added for clarity. The reference to &ldquo;an individual employed in or under an agency&rdquo; includes both officers and employees of an agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(5), the words &ldquo;in the General Schedule&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1091(3) to &ldquo;as specified in subchapter V of this chapter&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the reference to former section 1085 is omitted as unnecessary. Former section 1085 which exempted certain agencies from former sections 1151&ndash;1153 is carried into section 305.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;chapter 45 of title 39&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(1) to &ldquo;chapter 23 of title 39&rdquo; on authority of the Act of July 10, 1955, ch. 137, &sect;805, 69 Stat. 130, and the Act of Sept. 2, 1960, Pub. L. 86&ndash;682, &sect;5, 74 Stat. 705.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2)(B), the words &ldquo;this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(2)(B) to &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1923, as amended,&rdquo; on authority of section 1106 of the Act of Oct. 28, 1949, 63 Stat. 972, and technical section 7(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(4), the words &ldquo;chapter 15 of title 31, District of Columbia Code&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(4) to &ldquo;the District of Columbia Teachers Salary Act of 1947, as supplemented by Public Law 151, Eighty-first Congress, approved June 30, 1949&rdquo; on authority of the provisions contained therein. The words &ldquo;District of Columbia Court of General Sessions&rdquo; and &ldquo;District of Columbia Court of Appeals&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Municipal Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia&rdquo;, respectively, on authority of D.C. Code &sect;&sect;11&ndash;902 and 11&ndash;702. The exception for judges of the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia is based on D.C. Code &sect;11&ndash;1502.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(5), the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; is omitted as included in &ldquo;member&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(10), the words &ldquo;sections 6952 and 7478 of title 10&rdquo;, &ldquo;section 7044 of title 10&rdquo;, and &ldquo;section 7043 of title 10&rdquo; are substituted for the references in former section 1082(10) to &ldquo;section 1071 of title 34&rdquo;, &ldquo;sections 1076&ndash;1076f of title 34&rdquo;, and &ldquo;section 1074 of title 34&rdquo;, respectively, on authority of the Act of Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, &sect;49(b), 70A Stat. 640.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(11), the words &ldquo;the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the several States and the District of Columbia&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(14), the words &ldquo;employees necessary for the transaction of the business of the Service at canteens, warehouses, and storage depots whose employment is authorized by section 4202 of title 38&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(23) to &ldquo;positions which are exempt from this chapter, pursuant to section 4202 of title 38&rdquo;.</p>
