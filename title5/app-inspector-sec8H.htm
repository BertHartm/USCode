<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Congress, as a co-equal branch of Government, is empowered by the Constitution to serve as a check on the executive branch; in that capacity, it has a &lsquo;need to know&rsquo; of allegations of wrongdoing within the executive branch, including allegations of wrongdoing in the Intelligence Community;</p>
