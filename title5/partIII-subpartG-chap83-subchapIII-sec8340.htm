<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, effective December 1 of each year, each annuity payable from the Fund having a commencing date not later than such December 1 shall be increased by the percent change in the price index for the base quarter of such year over the price index for the base quarter of the preceding year in which an adjustment under this subsection was made, adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of 1 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section is governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the Fund as of the effective date of an increase, except as follows:</p>

However, the increase in a survivor annuity authorized by section 8 of the Act of May 29, 1930, as amended to July 6, 1950, shall be computed as if the annuity commencing date had been the effective date of the first increase under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an employee or Member before October 11, 1962; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a retired employee or Member whose retirement was based on a separation from service before October 11, 1962;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is increased by 10 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) An annuity shall not be increased by reason of any adjustment under this section to an amount which exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the maximum pay payable for GS&ndash;15 30 days before the effective date of the adjustment under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the final pay (or average pay, if higher) of the employee or Member with respect to whom the annuity is paid, increased by the overall annual average percentage adjustments (compounded) in rates of pay of the General Schedule under subchapter I of chapter 53 of this title during the period&mdash;</p>
