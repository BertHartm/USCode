<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) No later than 10 days before the Special Counsel terminates any investigation of a prohibited personnel practice, the Special Counsel shall provide a written status report to the person who made the allegation of the proposed findings of fact and legal conclusions. The person may submit written comments about the report to the Special Counsel. The Special Counsel shall not be required to provide a subsequent written status report under this subparagraph after the submission of such written comments.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:137 --><p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If the Special Counsel terminates any investigation under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel shall prepare and transmit to any person on whose allegation the investigation was initiated a written statement notifying the person of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the termination of the investigation;</p>

An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may seek corrective action from the Board under section 1221, if such employee, former employee, or applicant seeks corrective action for a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8) from the Special Counsel and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) the Special Counsel notifies such employee, former employee, or applicant that an investigation concerning such employee, former employee, or applicant has been terminated; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) no more than 60 days have elapsed since notification was provided to such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment that such investigation was terminated; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 120 days after seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel, such employee, former employee, or applicant has not been notified by the Special Counsel that the Special Counsel shall seek corrective action on behalf of such employee, former employee, or applicant.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) In addition to any authority granted under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel may, in the absence of an allegation, conduct an investigation for the purpose of determining whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice (or a pattern of prohibited personnel practices) has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A)(i) The Special Counsel may request any member of the Merit Systems Protection Board to order a stay of any personnel action for 45 days if the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) on motion of the Special Counsel, unless notice and opportunity for oral or written comments are first provided to the individual on whose behalf the stay was ordered.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) Except as provided under clause (ii), no later than 240 days after the date of receiving an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel shall make a determination whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Special Counsel is unable to make the required determination within the 240-day period specified under clause (i) and the person submitting the allegation of a prohibited personnel practice agrees to an extension of time, the determination shall be made within such additional period of time as shall be agreed upon between the Special Counsel and the person submitting the allegation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, in connection with any investigation, the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken which requires corrective action, the Special Counsel shall report the determination together with any findings or recommendations to the Board, the agency involved and to the Office of Personnel Management, and may report such determination, findings and recommendations to the President. The Special Counsel may include in the report recommendations for corrective action to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If, after a reasonable period of time, the agency does not act to correct the prohibited personnel practice, the Special Counsel may petition the Board for corrective action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) If the Special Counsel finds, in consultation with the individual subject to the prohibited personnel practice, that the agency has acted to correct the prohibited personnel practice, the Special Counsel shall file such finding <!-- PDFPage:138 -->with the Board, together with any written comments which the individual may provide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) A determination by the Special Counsel under this paragraph shall not be cited or referred to in any proceeding under this paragraph or any other administrative or judicial proceeding for any purpose, without the consent of the person submitting the allegation of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever the Special Counsel petitions the Board for corrective action, the Board shall provide an opportunity for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) oral or written comments by the Special Counsel, the agency involved, and the Office of Personnel Management; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) written comments by any individual who alleges to be the subject of the prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate, if the Board determines that the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a prohibited personnel practice, other than one described in section 2302(b)(8), has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to the provisions of clause (ii), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a disclosure described under section 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Corrective action under clause (i) may not be ordered if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Judicial review of any final order or decision of the Board under this section may be obtained by any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment adversely affected by such order or decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A petition for review under this subsection shall be filed with such court, and within such time, as provided for under section 7703(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken, the Special Counsel shall proceed with any investigation or proceeding unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the alleged violation has been reported to the Attorney General; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Attorney General is pursuing an investigation, in which case the Special Counsel, after consultation with the Attorney General, has discretion as to whether to proceed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If, in connection with any investigation under this subchapter, the Special Counsel determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that any violation of any law, rule, or regulation has occurred other than one referred to in subsection (b) or (d), the Special Counsel shall report such violation to the head of the agency involved. The Special Counsel shall require, within 30 days after the receipt of the report by the agency, a certification by the head of the agency which states&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the head of the agency has personally reviewed the report; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) what action has been or is to be taken, and when the action will be completed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) During any investigation initiated under this subchapter, no disciplinary action shall be taken against any employee for any alleged prohibited activity under investigation or for any related activity without the approval of the Special Counsel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If the Board orders corrective action under this section, such corrective action may include&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reimbursement for attorney's fees, back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential damages.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to the provisions of subsection (b) of this section and subsection 1214(a)(3), an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment may, with respect to any personnel action taken, or proposed to be taken, against such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice described in section 2302(b)(8), seek corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) This section may not be construed to prohibit any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment from seeking corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board before seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel, if such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment seeking corrective action under subsection (a) may request that the Board order a stay of the personnel action involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any stay requested under paragraph (1) shall be granted within 10 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date the request is made, if the Board determines that such a stay would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Board shall allow any agency which would be subject to a stay under this subsection to comment to the Board on such stay request.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:141 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), a stay granted under this subsection shall remain in effect for such period as the Board determines to be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Board may modify or dissolve a stay under this subsection at any time, if the Board determines that such a modification or dissolution is appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) At the request of an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment seeking corrective action under subsection (a), the Board shall issue a subpoena for the attendance and testimony of any person or the production of documentary or other evidence from any person if the Board finds that the testimony or production requested is not unduly burdensome and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A subpoena under this subsection may be issued, and shall be enforced, in the same manner as applies in the case of subpoenas under section 1204.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has demonstrated that a disclosure described under section 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant. The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the official taking the personnel action knew of the disclosure; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the personnel action occurred within a period of time such that a reasonable person could conclude that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Corrective action under paragraph (1) may not be ordered if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) A final order or decision shall be rendered by the Board as soon as practicable after the commencement of any proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A decision to terminate an investigation under subchapter II may not be considered in any action or other proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, based on evidence presented to it under this section, the Merit Systems Protection Board determines that there is reason to believe that a current employee may have committed a prohibited personnel practice, the Board shall refer the matter to the Special Counsel to investigate and take appropriate action under section 1215.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1)(A) If the Board orders corrective action under this section, such corrective action may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Corrective action shall include attorney's fees and costs as provided for under paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment is the prevailing party before the Merit Systems Protection Board, and the decision is based on a finding of a prohibited personnel practice, the agency involved shall be liable to the employee, former employee, or applicant for reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable costs incurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an employee, former emloyee,<sup><a href="#1221_1_target" name="1221_1">1</a></sup> or applicant for employment is the prevailing party in an appeal from the Merit Systems Protection Board, the agency involved shall be liable to the employee, former employee, or applicant for reasonable attorney's fees and any other reasonable costs incurred, regardless of the basis of the decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Board under this section may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A petition for review under this subsection shall be filed with such court, and within such time, as provided for under section 7703(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Subsections (a) through (h) shall apply in any proceeding brought under section 7513(d) if, or to the extent that, a prohibited personnel practice as defined in section 2302(b)(8) is alleged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) In determining the appealability of any case involving an allegation made by an individual under the provisions of this chapter, neither the status of an individual under any retirement system established under a Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system may be taken into account.</p>
