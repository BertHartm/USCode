<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1), the words &ldquo;when used in a geographical sense&rdquo; are added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (2), the words &ldquo;an employee as defined by section 2105 of this title&rdquo; are coextensive with and substituted for &ldquo;civilian officers and employees of the United States . . . including officers and employees of corporations wholly owned or controlled by the United States&rdquo;. Specific reference to officers and members of the Metropolitan Police force of the District of Columbia, the Fire Department of the District of Columbia, the United States Park Police force, and the White House Police force, as set forth in former section 2067, is omitted as unnecessary in view of the provisions of paragraph (2)(A), (B). The exception for &ldquo;commissioned officers of the Public Health Service&rdquo; and &ldquo;commissioned officers of the Coast and Geodetic Survey&rdquo; in former section 2061(b)(1)(E), (F) is omitted as unnecessary since these officers are excluded by the definition of the word &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in section 2105.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (2)(ix), the words &ldquo;as defined by section 901 of title 20&rdquo; are added on authority of former section 2351, which section is scheduled for transfer to section 901 of title 20.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
