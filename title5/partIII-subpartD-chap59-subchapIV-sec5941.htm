<p class="note-body">The section is reorganized and restated for clarity and conciseness.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;allowances&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;additional compensation&rdquo; as a more apt term and for consistency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;executive departments, independent establishments, and wholly owned Government corporations&rdquo; in view of the definition of &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; in section 105. The exception of a &ldquo;Government controlled corporation&rdquo; is added to preserve the application to &ldquo;wholly owned Government corporation&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) is based on the second proviso of former section 118h and is restated to reflect the provisions of sections 511(b), (c)(7) and 521 of the Act of Sept. 6, 1960, Pub. L. 86&ndash;707, 74 Stat. 800&ndash;802. The reference to section 204 of the Act of Apr. 20, 1948, is omitted as obsolete, since the section was applicable only to fiscal year 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body">The last proviso of former section 118h which provided the effective date of the section is omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
