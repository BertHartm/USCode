The regulation-making power conferred by that section covers the power conferred by former section 633(2)7 (last 17 words) which is, therefore, omitted. The requirement of notice is preserved in section 3304. The words &ldquo;through its members or the examiners&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of section 1104. The authority of the President to prescribe rules, based on former section 633(1) is carried into sections 2951, 3302, 3304(a), 3306(a), 3321, 7152, 7153, 7321, and 7322 of this title.</p>

The first 76 words of former section 851 are added here to preserve the general statement of policy in the light of which the substantive provisions that formerly comprised the Veterans&rsquo; Preference Act of 1944 are to be interpreted. See <em>Elder</em> v. <em>Brannan,</em> 241 U.S. 277, 286. In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;in the competitive service in Executive agencies, permanent or temporary, and in the government of the District of Columbia&rdquo;, and in subsection (c) the words &ldquo;in the excepted service in Executive agencies, permanent or temporary, and in the government of the District of Columbia&rdquo; are coextensive with and substituted for &ldquo;in civilian positions in all establishments, agencies, bureaus, administrations, projects, and departments of the Government, permanent or temporary, and in either (a) the classified civil service; (b) the unclassified civil service; (c) any temporary or emergency establishment, agency, bureau, administration, project, and department created by Acts of Congress or Presidential Executive order&rdquo;, in view of the exclusion of positions in the legislative and judicial branches by former section 869.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Office of Personnel Management shall conduct the investigations and issue the reports required by the following statutes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sections 272b, 281b(e), and 290a of title 22;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 1874(c) of title 42; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) section 1203(e) of title 6,<sup><a href="#1304_1_target" name="1304_1">1</a></sup> District of Columbia Code.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When an investigation under subsection (a) of this section develops data indicating that the loyalty of the individual being investigated is questionable, the Office shall refer the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a full field investigation, a report of which shall be furnished to the Office for its information and appropriate action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the President considers it in the national interest, he may have the investigations of a group or class, which are required by subsection (a) of this section, made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation rather than the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The investigation and report required by subsection (a) of this section shall be made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation rather than the Office for those specific positions which the Secretary of State certifies are of a high degree of importance or sensitivity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) A revolving fund is available, to the Office without fiscal year limitation, for financing investigations, training, and such other functions as the Office is authorized or required to perform on a reimbursable basis. However, the functions which may be financed in any fiscal year by the fund are restricted to those functions which are covered by the budget estimates submitted to the Congress for that fiscal year. To the maximum extent feasible, each individual activity shall be conducted generally on an actual cost basis over a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The capital of the fund consists of the aggregate of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) appropriations made to provide capital for the fund, which appropriations are hereby authorized, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the sum of the fair and reasonable value of such supplies, equipment, and other assets as the Office from time to time transfers to the fund (including the amount of the unexpended balances of appropriations or funds relating to activities the financing of which is transferred to the fund) less the amount of related liabilities, the amount of unpaid obligations, and the value of accrued annual leave of employees, which are attributable to the activities the financing of which is transferred to the fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The fund shall be credited with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) advances and reimbursements from available funds of the Office or other agencies, or from other sources, for those services and supplies provided at rates estimated by the Office as adequate to recover expenses of operation (including provision for accrued annual leave of employees and depreciation of equipment); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) receipts from sales or exchanges of property, and payments for loss of or damage to property, accounted for under the fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any unobligated and unexpended balances in the fund which the Office determines to be in excess of amounts needed for activities financed by the fund shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Office shall prepare a business-type budget providing full disclosure of the results of operations for each of the functions performed by the Office and financed by the fund, and such budget shall be transmitted to the Congress and considered, in the manner prescribed by law for wholly owned Government corporations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Comptroller General of the United States shall, as a result of his periodic reviews of the activities financed by the fund, report and make such recommendations as he deems appropriate to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives at least once every three years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) An agency may use available appropriations to reimburse the Office or the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the cost of investigations, training, and functions performed for them under this section, or to make advances toward their cost. These advances and reimbursements shall be credited directly to the applicable appropriations of the Office or the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) This section does not affect the responsibility of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to investigate espionage, sabotage, or subversive acts.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is based on section 1 of the Act of April 5, 1952, as amended, and is added for clarity. In subsection (a), the reference to section 10(b)(5)(B)(i) and (B)(ii) of the Act of August 1, 1946 (60 Stat. 766) is omitted because of the amendment of the Act of April 5, 1952, by the Act of July 31, 1953, ch. 283, 67 Stat. 240, and the reenactment of the provisions of the Act of April 5, 1952, insofar as they relate to the Atomic Energy Commission as section 145 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 942; 42 U.S.C. 2165).

Reference to section 510 of the Mutual Security Act of 1951 (65 Stat. 381) is omitted because this section was replaced by section 531 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 859) and the latter was repealed by the Act of Sept. 4, 1961, Pub.

Plan No. 7, 67 Stat. 641, and Executive Order 10610 of May 9, 1955) are omitted because of the disposition of the two sections as explained with reference to subsection (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;There is established&rdquo; are omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the reference to statutes other than this section is omitted because nothing in those statutes affect the responsibility in question.</p>
