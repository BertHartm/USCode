<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1)(A) The employing agency shall deduct and withhold from the basic pay of an employee, Member, Congressional employee, law enforcement officer, firefighter, bankruptcy judge, judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, United States magistrate,<sup><a href="#8334_1_target" name="8334_1">1</a></sup> Court of Federal Claims judge, member of the Capitol Police, member of the Supreme Court Police, nuclear materials courier, or customs and border protection officer, as the case may be, the percentage of basic pay applicable under subsection (c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), an equal amount shall be contributed from the appropriation or fund used to pay the employee or, in the case of an elected official, from an appropriation or fund available for payment of other salaries of the same office or establishment. When an employee in the legislative branch is paid by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, the Chief Administrative Officer may pay from the applicable accounts of the House of Representatives the contribution that otherwise would be contributed from the appropriation or fund used to pay the employee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each employee or Member credited with civilian service after July 31, 1920, for which retirement deductions or deposits have not been made, may deposit with interest an amount equal to the following percentages of his basic pay received for that service:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection and any provision of section 206(b)(3) of the Federal Employees&rsquo; Retirement Contribution Temporary Adjustment Act of 1983, the percentage of basic pay required under this subsection in the case of an individual described in section 8402(b)(2) shall, with respect to any covered service (as defined by section 203(a)(3) of such Act) performed by such individual after December 31, 1983, and before January 1, 1987, be equal to 1.3 percent, and, with respect to any such service performed after December 31, 1986, be equal to the amount that would have been deducted from the employee's basic pay under subsection (k) of this section if the employee's pay had been subject to that subsection during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Each employee or Member who has received a refund of retirement deductions under this or any other retirement system established for employees of the Government covering service for which he may be allowed credit under this subchapter may deposit the amount received, with interest. Credit may not be allowed for the service covered by the refund until the deposit is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) This paragraph applies with respect to any employee or Member who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) separates before March 1, 1991, and receives (or elects, in accordance with applicable provisions of this subchapter, to receive) a refund (described in paragraph (1)) which relates to a period of service ending before March 1, 1991;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) which is based on service of such employee or Member, and which commences on or after December 2, 1990; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) does not make the deposit (described in paragraph (1)) required in order to receive credit for the period of service with respect to which the refund relates.</p>
