<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintains individual accountability by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establishing one or more retention standards for each employee related to the work of the employee and expressed in terms of individual performance, and communicating such retention standards to employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) making periodic determinations of whether each employee meets or does not meet the employee's established retention standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) taking actions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, with respect to any employee whose performance does not meet established retention standards, including denying any increases in basic pay, promotions, and credit for performance under section 3502, and taking one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Reassignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) An action under chapter 43 or chapter 75 of this title.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) except as provided under section 1204 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, strengthens the system's effectiveness by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establishing goals or objectives for individual, group, or organizational performance (or any combination thereof), consistent with the Internal Revenue Service's performance planning procedures, including those established under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, subtitle III of title 40, Revenue Procedure 64&ndash;22 (as in effect on July 30, 1997), and taxpayer service surveys, and communicating such goals or objectives to employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) using such goals and objectives to make performance distinctions among employees or groups of employees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) using performance assessments as a basis for granting employee awards, adjusting an employee's rate of basic pay, and other appropriate personnel actions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(2), the term &ldquo;performance assessment&rdquo; means a determination of whether or not retention standards established under subsection (a)(1)(A) are met, and any additional performance determination made on the basis of performance goals and objectives established under subsection (a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this title, the term &ldquo;unacceptable performance&rdquo; with respect to an employee of the Internal Revenue Service covered by a performance management system established under this section means performance of the employee which fails to meet a retention standard established under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury may establish an awards program designed to provide incentives for and recognition of organizational, group, and individual achievements by providing for granting awards to employees who, as individuals or members of a group, contribute to meeting the performance goals and objectives established under this chapter by such means as a superior individual or group accomplishment, a documented productivity gain, or sustained superior performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cash award under subchapter I of chapter 45 may be granted to an employee of the Internal Revenue Service without the need for any approval under section 4502(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In applying sections 4303(b)(1)(A) and 7513(b)(1) to employees of the Internal Revenue Service, &ldquo;30 days&rdquo; may be deemed to be &ldquo;15 days&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the second sentence of section 5335(c), an employee of the Internal Revenue Service shall not have a right to appeal the denial of a periodic step increase under section 5335 to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>
