<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1), the term &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; is coextensive with and substituted for &ldquo;executive department or independent agency in the executive branch of the Government including a Government-owned or controlled corporation&rdquo; in view of the definition of &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; in section 105. Application to the General Accounting Office (included in the term &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo;) is based on former section 933a.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) is supplied because the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in section 2105 does not encompass individuals employed by the government of the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (3) is supplied for clarity and convenience.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
