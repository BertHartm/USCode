<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An employee or Member who has a former spouse may elect, under procedures prescribed by the Office, a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member under section 8419(a) in order to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse under section 8445.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An election under this subsection shall be made at the time of retirement or, if the marriage is dissolved after the date of retirement, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is so dissolved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An election under this subsection&mdash;</p>
