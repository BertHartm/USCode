<p class="note-body">Former sections 95 and 95a are combined and restated for clarity and brevity. The words &ldquo;or expenses in the case of Government officers and employees&rdquo; are omitted as covered by section 1823 of title 28. The word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;department&rdquo; and defined to conform to the definition of &ldquo;department&rdquo; in section 18 of the Act of Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 744, 60 Stat. 811.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, &sect;201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, &sect;4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171&ndash;1), which provides &ldquo;Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense&rdquo; is omitted from this title but is not repealed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
