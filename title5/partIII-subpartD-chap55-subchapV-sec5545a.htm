The investigator is generally responsible for recognizing, without supervision, circumstances which require the investigator to be on duty or be available for unscheduled duty based on the needs of the agency. Availability pay provided to a criminal investigator for such unscheduled duty shall be paid instead of premium pay provided by other provisions of this subchapter, except premium pay for regularly scheduled overtime work as provided under section 5542, night duty, Sunday duty, and holiday duty.</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(4) An investigator shall be considered to be available when the investigator cannot reasonably and generally be accessible due to a status or assignment which is the result of an agency direction, order, or approval as provided under subsection (f)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Each criminal investigator receiving availability pay under this section and the appropriate supervisory officer, to be designated by the head of the agency, shall make an annual certification to the head of the agency that the investigator has met, and is expected to meet, the requirements of subsection (d). The head of a law enforcement agency may prescribe regulations necessary to administer this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Agencies or departments may provide availability pay to investigators when on excused absence with pay, except as provided in paragraph (1)(D).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Section 5545(c) shall not apply to any criminal investigator who is paid availability pay under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) Availability pay under this section shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 25 percent of the rate of basic pay for the position; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) treated as part of the basic pay for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sections 5595(c), 8114(e), 8331(3), 8431, and 8704(c); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The provisions of subsections (a)&ndash;(h) providing for availability pay shall apply to a pilot employed by the United States Customs Service who is a law enforcement officer as defined under section 5541(3). For the purpose of this section, section 5542(d) of this title, and section 13(a)(16) and (b)(30) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 213(a)(16) and (b)(30)), such pilot shall be deemed to be a criminal investigator as defined in this section. The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe regulations to carry out this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any Office of Inspector General which employs fewer than 5 criminal investigators may elect not to cover such criminal investigators under this section.</p>
