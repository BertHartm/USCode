<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Each criminal investigator receiving availability pay under this section and the appropriate supervisory officer, to be designated by the head of the agency, shall make an annual certification to the head of the agency that the investigator has met, and is expected to meet, the requirements of subsection (d).

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 25 percent of the rate of basic pay for the position; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) treated as part of the basic pay for purposes of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) sections 5595(c), 8114(e), 8331(3), and 8704(c); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The provisions of subsections (a)&ndash;(h) providing for availability pay shall apply to a pilot employed by the United States Customs Service who is a law enforcement officer as defined under section 5541(3). For the purpose of this section, section 5542(d) of this title, and section 13(a)(16) and (b)(30) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (29 U.S.C. 213(a)(16) and (b)(30)), such pilot shall be deemed to be a criminal investigator as defined in this section.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) meets the definition of such term under paragraph (2) of subsection (a) (applied disregarding the parenthetical matter before subparagraph (A) thereof); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such special agent satisfies the requirements of subsection (d) without taking into account any hours described in paragraph (2)(B) thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In applying subsection (h) with respect to a special agent under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any reference in such subsection to &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; shall be considered to include amounts designated as &ldquo;salary&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) paragraph (2)(A) of such subsection shall be considered to include (in addition to the provisions of law specified therein) sections 609(b)(1), 805, 806, and 856 of the Foreign Service Act of 1980; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) paragraph (2)(B) of such subsection shall be applied by substituting for &ldquo;Office of Personnel Management&rdquo; the following: &ldquo;Office of Personnel Management or the Secretary of State (to the extent that matters exclusively within the jurisdiction of the Secretary are concerned)&rdquo;.</p>
