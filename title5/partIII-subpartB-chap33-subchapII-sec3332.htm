The term &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is coextensive with and substituted for &ldquo;Each individual appointed hereafter as a civil officer of the United States by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, or by the President alone, or by a court of law, or by the head of a department&rdquo; in view of the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 2104.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
