(a)(1), probably means section 195(b) of the National and Community Service Act of 1990, Pub. L. 101&ndash;610, which was enacted by section 202(a) of the National and Community Service Trust Act of 1993, Pub.

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;204, &sect;23(a)(4), Dec. 17, 1993, 107 Stat. 2408, which directed the amendment of section 8F(a)(2) by striking out &ldquo;the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation,&rdquo;, could not be executed to this section because the quoted language does not appear. However, the amendment was executed to section 8G(a)(2) of the Inspector General Act of 1978 relating to requirements for Federal entities and designated Federal entities, to reflect the probable intent of Congress and the successive renumbering of that section as section 8F by Pub. L. 103&ndash;82 and as section 8G by Pub. L. 103&ndash;204.</p>
