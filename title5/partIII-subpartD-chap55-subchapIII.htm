<p class="note-body">(a) To the maximum extent practicable, the Secretary of State, the Office of Personnel Management, and the heads of other Federal agencies shall exercise their authority under the act and this order so that employees of different Federal agencies evacuated from the same geographic area under the same general circumstances may be treated uniformly.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Advance payments of compensation, allowances, and differentials, as authorized by section 2 of the act [section 5522 of this title], shall be held to the minimum period during which the order for evacuation is anticipated to continue, and shall in no event be made for a period of more than thirty days.</p>

Such payments of monetary amounts under the authority of section 3 of the act shall be terminated as of such dates as may be determined by the Secretary of State or the Office of Personnel Management, as appropriate, but not later than the date on which an employee resumes his duties at the post from which he has been evacuated or is assigned to another position.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. (a) The head of each Federal agency shall issue as soon as practicable such regulations as may be necessary and appropriate to carry out his functions under the act and this order.</p>
