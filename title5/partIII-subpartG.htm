<p class="statutory-body">(b) Disability or death from a war-risk hazard or during or as a result of capture, detention, or other restraint by a hostile force or individual, suffered by an employee who is employed outside the continental United States or in Alaska or in the areas and installations in the Republic of Panama made available to the United States pursuant to the Panama Canal Treaty of 1977 and related agreements (as described in section 3(a) of the Panama Canal Act of 1979), is deemed to have resulted from personal injury sustained while in the performance of his duty, whether or not the employee was engaged in the course of employment when the disability or disability resulting in death occurred or when he was taken by the hostile force or individual. This subsection does not apply to an individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) whose residence is at or in the vicinity of the place of his employment and who was not living there solely because of the exigencies of his employment, unless he was injured or taken while engaged in the course of his employment; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) If there is permanent disability involving the loss, or loss of use, of a member or function of the body or involving disfigurement, the employee is entitled to basic compensation for the disability, as provided by the schedule in subsection (c) of this section, at the rate of 662/3 percent of his monthly pay. The basic compensation is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) payable regardless of whether the cause of the disability originates in a part of the body other than that member;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) payable regardless of whether the disability also involves another impairment of the body; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:696 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in addition to compensation for temporary total or temporary partial disability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) With respect to any period after payments under subsection (a) of this section have ended, an employee is entitled to compensation as provided by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) section 8105 of this title if the disability is total; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Third finger lost, 25 weeks&rsquo; compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Toe other than great toe lost, 16 weeks&rsquo; compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Fourth finger lost, 15 weeks&rsquo; compensation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) complete loss of hearing of one ear, 52 weeks&rsquo; compensation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) complete loss of hearing of both ears, 200 weeks&rsquo; compensation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Compensation for loss of binocular vision or for loss of 80 percent or more of the vision of an eye is the same as for loss of the eye.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) Compensation for loss of more than one phalanx of a digit is the same as for loss of the entire digit. Compensation for loss of the first phalanx is one-half of the compensation for loss of the entire digit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) If, in the case of an arm or a leg, the member is amputated above the wrist or ankle, compensation is the same as for loss of the arm or leg, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Compensation for loss of use of two or more digits, or one or more phalanges of each of two or more digits, of a hand or foot, is proportioned to the loss of use of the hand or foot occasioned thereby.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) Compensation for permanent total loss of use of a member is the same as for loss of the member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) Compensation for permanent partial loss of use of a member may be for proportionate loss of use of the member. The degree of loss of vision or hearing under this schedule is determined without regard to correction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) In case of loss of use of more than one member or parts of more than one member as enumerated by this schedule, the compensation is for loss of use of each member or part thereof, and the awards run consecutively. However, when the injury affects only two or more digits of the same hand or foot, paragraph (17) of this subsection applies, and when partial bilateral loss of hearing is involved, compensation is computed on the loss as affecting both ears.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) For serious disfigurement of the face, head, or neck of a character likely to handicap an individual in securing or maintaining employment, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed $3,500 shall be awarded in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(22) For permanent loss or loss of use of any other important external or internal organ of the body as determined by the Secretary, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed 312 weeks&rsquo; compensation for each organ so determined shall be paid in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;overtime pay&rdquo; means pay for hours of service in excess of a statutory or other basic workweek or other basic unit of worktime, as observed by the employing establishment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;year&rdquo; means a period of 12 calendar months, or the equivalent thereof as specified by regulations prescribed by the Secretary of Labor.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In computing monetary compensation for disability or death on the basis of monthly pay, that pay is determined under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The monthly pay at the time of injury is deemed one-twelfth of the average annual earnings of the employee at that time. When compensation is paid on a weekly basis, the weekly equivalent of the monthly pay is deemed one-fifty-second of the average annual earnings. However, for so much of a period of total disability as does not exceed 90 calendar days from the date of the beginning of compensable disability, the compensation, in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor, may be computed on the basis of the actual daily wage of the employee at the time of injury in which event he may be paid compensation for the days he would have worked but for the injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Average annual earnings are determined as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the employee worked in the employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury and the employment was in a position for which an annual rate of pay&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) was fixed, the average annual earnings are the annual rate of pay; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) was not fixed, the average annual earnings are the product obtained by multiplying his daily wage for the particular employment, or the average thereof if the daily wage has fluctuated, by 300 if he was employed on the basis of a 6-day workweek, 280 if employed on the basis of a 51/2-day week, and 260 if employed on the basis of a 5-day week.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the employee did not work in employment in which he was employed at the time of his injury during substantially the whole year immediately preceding the injury, but the position was one which would have afforded employment for substantially a whole year, the average annual earnings are a sum equal to the average annual earnings of an employee of the same class working substantially the whole immediately preceding year in the same or similar employment by the United States in the same or neighboring place, as determined under paragraph (1) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If either of the foregoing methods of determining the average annual earnings cannot be applied reasonably and fairly, the average annual earnings are a sum that reasonably represents the annual earning capacity of the injured employee in the employment in which he was working at the time of the injury having regard to the previous earnings of the employee in Federal employment, and of other employees of the United States in the same or most similar class working in the same or most similar employment in the same or neighboring location, other previous employment of the employee, or other relevant factors. However, the average annual earnings may not be less than 150 times the average daily wage the employee earned in the employment during the days employed within 1 year immediately preceding his injury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) If the employee served without pay or at nominal pay, paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of this subsection apply as far as practicable, but the average annual earnings of the employee may not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS&ndash;15. If the average annual earnings cannot be determined reasonably and fairly in the manner otherwise provided by this section, the average annual earnings shall be determined at the reasonable value of the service performed but not in excess of $3,600 a year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The value of subsistence and quarters, and of any other form of remuneration in kind for services if its value can be estimated in money, and premium pay under section 5545(c)(1) of this title are included as part of the pay, but account is not taken of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) overtime pay;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) additional pay or allowance authorized outside the United States because of differen<!-- PDFPage:701 -->tial in cost of living or other special circumstances; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) bonus or premium pay for extraordinary service including bonus or pay for particularly hazardous service in time of war.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) While an employee is receiving compensation under this subchapter, or if he has been paid a lump sum in commutation of installment payments until the expiration of the period during which the installment payments would have continued, he may not receive salary, pay, or remuneration of any type from the United States, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in return for service actually performed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pension for service in the Army, Navy, or Air Force;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) other benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs unless such benefits are payable for the same injury or the same death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) retired pay, retirement pay, retainer pay, or equivalent pay for service in the Armed Forces or other uniformed services.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title, or another retirement system for employees of the Government, does not impair the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An individual entitled to benefits under this subchapter because of his injury, or because of the death of an employee, who also is entitled to receive from the United States under a provision of statute other than this subchapter payments or benefits for that injury or death (except proceeds of an insurance policy), because of service by him (or in the case of death, by the deceased) as an employee or in the armed forces, shall elect which benefits he will receive. The individual shall make the election within 1 year after the injury or death or within a further time allowed for good cause by the Secretary of Labor. The election when made is irrevocable, except as otherwise provided by statute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen's compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute. However, this subsection does not apply to a master or a member of a crew of a vessel.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:702 --><p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, an individual receiving benefits for disability or death under this subchapter who is also receiving benefits under subchapter III of chapter 84 of this title or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act shall be entitled to all such benefits, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) benefits received under section 223 of the Social Security Act (on account of disability) shall be subject to reduction on account of benefits paid under this subchapter pursuant to the provisions of section 224 of the Social Security Act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of benefits received on account of age or death under title II of the Social Security Act, compensation payable under this subchapter based on the Federal service of an employee shall be reduced by the amount of any such social security benefits payable that are attributable to Federal service of that employee covered by chapter 84 of this title. However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under chapter 84 of this title, or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act by virtue of service covered by chapter 84 of this title, does not affect the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">If an injury or death for which compensation is payable under this subchapter is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the United States to pay damages, and a beneficiary entitled to compensation from the United States for that injury or death receives money or other property in satisfaction of that liability as the result of suit or settlement by him or in his behalf, the beneficiary, after deducting therefrom the costs of suit and a reasonable attorney's fee, shall refund to the United States the amount of compensation paid by the United States and credit any surplus on future payments of compensation payable to him for the same injury. No court, insurer, attorney, or other person shall pay or distribute to the beneficiary or his designee the proceeds of such suit or settlement without first satisfying or assuring satisfaction of the interest of the United States. The amount refunded to the United States shall be credited to the Employees&rsquo; Compensation Fund.

However, the beneficiary is entitled to retain, as a minimum, at least one-fifth of the net amount of the money or other property remaining after the expenses of a suit or settlement have been deducted; and in addition to this minimum and at the time of distribution, an amount equivalent to a reasonable attorney's fee proportionate to the refund to the United States.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If death results from an injury sustained in the performance of duty, the United States shall pay a monthly compensation equal to a percentage of the monthly pay of the deceased employee in accordance with the following schedule:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To the widow or widower, if there is no child, 50 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the widow or widower, if there is a child, 45 percent and in addition 15 percent for each child not to exceed a total of 75 percent for the widow or widower and children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the children, if there is no widow or widower, 40 percent for one child and 15 percent additional for each additional child not to exceed a total of 75 percent, divided among the children share and share alike.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the parents, if there is no widow, widower, or child, as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 25 percent if one parent was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death and the other was not dependent to any extent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 20 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor if one or both were partly dependent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If there is a widow, widower, or child, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, and children, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To the brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren, if there is no widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 20 percent if one was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 30 percent if more than one was wholly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) 10 percent if no one is wholly dependent but one or more is partly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If there is a widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, children, and dependent parents, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The compensation payable under subsection (a) of this section is paid from the time of death until&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a widow, or widower dies or remarries before reaching age 55;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a child, a brother, a sister, or a grandchild dies, marries, or becomes 18 years of age, or if over age 18 and incapable of self-support becomes capable of self-support; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a parent or grandparent dies, marries, or ceases to be dependent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, compensation payable to or for a child, a brother or sister, or grandchild that would otherwise end because the child, brother or sister, or grandchild has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he is a student as defined by section 8101 of this title at the time he reaches 18 years of age for so long as he continues to be such a student or until he marries. A widow or widower who has entitlements to benefits under this title derived from more than one husband or wife shall elect one entitlement to be utilized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) On the cessation of compensation under this section to or on account of an individual, the compensation of the remaining individuals entitled to compensation for the unexpired part of the period during which their compensation is payable, is that which they would have received if they had been the only individuals entitled to compensation at the time of the death of the employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When there are two or more classes of individuals entitled to compensation under this section and the apportionment of compensation under this section would result in injustice, the Secretary may modify the apportionment to meet the requirements of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In computing compensation under this section, the monthly pay is deemed not less than the minimum rate of basic pay for GS&ndash;2. However, the total monthly compensation may not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the monthly pay computed under section 8114 of this title, except for increases authorized by section 8146a of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 75 percent of the monthly pay of the maximum rate of basic pay for GS&ndash;15.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any funeral and burial expenses paid under section 8134, there shall be paid a sum of $200 to the personal representative of a deceased employee within the meaning of section 8101(1) of this title for reimbursement of the costs of termination of the decedent's status as an employee of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Each employee or Member who has received a refund of retirement deductions under this or any other retirement system established for employees of the Government covering service for which he may be allowed credit under this subchapter may deposit the amount received, with interest. Credit may not be allowed for the service covered by the refund until the deposit is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) This paragraph applies with respect to any employee or Member who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) separates before March 1, 1991, and receives (or elects, in accordance with applicable provisions of this subchapter, to receive) a refund (described in paragraph (1)) which relates to a period of service ending before March 1, 1991;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter (other than a disability annuity) which is based on service of such employee or Member, and which commences on or after December 2, 1990; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) does not make the deposit (described in paragraph (1)) required in order to receive credit for the period of service with respect to which the refund relates.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the amount the Director pays under this subsection shall constitute an employer contribution to the Fund, excludable under section 402 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 from the employee's gross income until such time as the contribution is distributed or made available to the employee, and shall not be subject to refund or to lump-sum payment to the employee.</p>

Upon such an election, the judge or magistrate judge shall be entitled to a lump-sum credit under section 8342(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a judge who is covered by section 7296 of title 38 shall not be subject to deductions and contributions to the Fund, if the judge notifies the Director of the Office of Personnel Management of an election of a retirement annuity under that section.

<p class="statutory-body">(6) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, a judge of the United States Court of Federal Claims who is covered by section 178 of title 28 shall not be subject to deductions and contributions to the Fund if the judge notifies the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts of an election of a retirement annuity under those provisions. Upon such an election, the judge shall be entitled to a lump-sum credit under section 8342(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), and subject to paragraph (5), each employee or Member who has performed military service before the date of the separation on which the entitlement to any annuity under this subchapter is based may pay, in accordance with such regulations as the Office shall issue, to the agency by which the employee is employed, or, in the case of a Member or a Congressional employee, to the Secretary of the Senate or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, as appropriate, an amount equal to 7 percent of the amount of the basic pay paid under section 204 of title 37 to the employee or Member for each period of military service after December 1956. The amount of such payments shall be based on such evidence of basic pay for military service as the employee or Member may provide, or if the Office determines sufficient evidence has not been so provided to adequately determine basic pay for military service, such payment shall be based upon estimates of such basic pay provided to the Office under paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In any case where military service interrupts creditable civilian service under this subchapter and reemployment pursuant to chapter 43 of title 38 occurs on or after August 1, 1990, the deposit payable under this paragraph may not exceed the amount that would have been deducted and withheld under subsection (a)(1) from basic pay during civilian service if the employee had not performed the period of military service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any deposit made under paragraph (1) of this subsection more than two years after the later of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any payment received by an agency, the Secretary of the Senate, or the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives under this subsection shall be immediately re<!-- PDFPage:776 -->mitted to the Office for deposit in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Health and Human Services, as appropriate, shall furnish such information to the Office as the Office may determine to be necessary for the administration of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Effective with respect to any period of military service after December 31, 1998, the percentage of basic pay under section 204 of title 37 payable under paragraph (1) shall be equal to the same percentage as would be applicable under subsection (c) of this section for that same period for service as an employee, subject to paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) Effective with respect to pay periods beginning after December 31, 1986, in administering this section in the case of an individual described in section 8402(b)(2) of this title&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8337. Disability retirement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency. Any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the Office of Personnel Management to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position and is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, an employee of the United States Postal Service shall be considered not qualified for a reassignment described in that sentence if the reassignment is to a position in a different craft or is inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee. A judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces who completes 5 years of civilian service and who is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a judge of such court or who is removed for mental or physical disability under section 942(c) of title 10 shall be retired on the judge's own application or upon such removal. A Member who completes 5 years of Member serv<!-- PDFPage:793 -->ice and is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a Member because of disease or injury shall be retired on the Member's own application. An annuity authorized by this section is computed under section 8339(g) of this title, unless the employee or Member is eligible for a higher annuity computed under section 8339(a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), or (s).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund shall be examined under the direction of the Office&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at the end of 1 year from the date of the disability retirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) annually thereafter until he becomes 60 years of age;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless his disability is permanent in character. If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required by this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, recovers from his disability, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 1 year after the date of the medical examination showing the recovery, whichever is earlier. If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity is deemed restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (d) of this section is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, he is deemed, except for service credit, to have been involuntarily separated from the service for the purpose of this subchapter as of the date of termination of the disability annuity, and after that termination is entitled to annuity under the applicable provisions of this subchapter. If an annuitant whose annuity is heretofore or hereafter terminated because of an earning capacity provision of this subchapter or an earlier statute&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has not recovered from the disability for which he was retired;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">his annuity shall be restored at the same rate effective the first of the year following any calendar year in which his income from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement. If an annuitant whose annuity is heretofore or hereafter terminated because of a medical finding that he has recovered from disability is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, his annuity shall be restored at the same rate effective from the date of medical examination showing a recurrence of the disability. The second and third sentences of this subsection do not apply to an individual who has become 62 years of age and is receiving or is eligible to receive annuity under the first sentence of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) An individual is not entitled to receive&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an annuity under this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) compensation for injury to, or disability of, such individual under subchapter I of chapter 81, other than compensation payable under section 8107,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">covering the same period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under this subchapter and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter 81 on account of the death of the same person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this subchapter or subchapter I of chapter 81.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If an individual is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter, and the individual receives a lump-sum payment for compensation under section 8135 based on the disability or death of the same person, so much of the compensation as has been paid for a period extended beyond the date payment of the annuity commences, as determined by the Department of Labor, shall be refunded to that Department for credit to the Employees&rsquo; Compensation Fund. Before the individual may receive the annuity, the individual shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) refund to the Department of Labor the amount representing the commuted compensation payments for the extended period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) authorize the deduction of the amount from the annuity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Deductions from the annuity may be made from accrued or accruing payments. The amounts deducted and withheld from the annuity shall be transmitted to the Department of Labor for reimbursement to the Employees&rsquo; Compensation Fund. When the Department of Labor finds that the financial circumstances of an individual entitled to an annuity under this subchapter warrant deferred refunding, deductions from the annuity may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Department determines appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;technician&rdquo; means an individual employed under section 709(a) of title 32 or section 10216 of title 10 who, as a condition of the employment, is required under section 709(b) of title 32 or section 10216 of title 10, respectively, to be a member of the Selected Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, an individual shall be retired under this section if the individual&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:794 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is separated from employment as a technician under section 709(e)(1) of title 32 or section 10216 of title 10 by reason of a disability that disqualifies the individual from membership in the Selected Reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is not considered to be disabled under the second sentence of subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is not appointed to a position in the Government (whether under paragraph (3) of this subsection or otherwise); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) has not declined an offer of an appointment to a position in the Government under paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Payment of any annuity for an individual pursuant to this subsection terminates&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on the date the individual is appointed to a position in the Government (whether pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection or otherwise);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) on the date the individual declines an offer of appointment to a position in the Government under paragraph (3); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) as provided under subsection (d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any individual applying for or receiving any annuity pursuant to this subsection shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office, be considered by any agency of the Government before any vacant position in the agency is filled if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the position is located within the commuting area of the individual's former position;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the individual is qualified to serve in such position, as determined by the head of the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the position is at the same grade or equivalent level as the position from which the individual was separated under section 709(e)(1) of title 32 or section 10216 of title 10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) service as an employee of the Panama Canal Commission; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) service at a permanent duty station in the Canal Zone or Republic of Panama as an employee of an Executive agency conducting operations in the Canal Zone or Republic of Panama; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(7) The annuity of an employee who is a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces, or a former judge of such court, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a) of this section, except, with respect to his service as a judge of such court, his service as a Member, his congressional employee service, and his military service (not exceeding 5 years) creditable under section 8332 of this title, his annuity is computed by multiplying 21/2 percent of his average pay by the years of that service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The annuity of an employee retiring under section 8336(e) of this title is computed under subsection (a) of this section. That annuity may not be less than 50 percent of the average pay of the employee unless such employee has received, pursuant to section 8342 of this title, payment of the lump-sum credit attributable to deductions under section 8334(a) of this title during any period of employment as an air traffic controller and such employee has not deposited in the Fund the amount received, with interest, pursuant to section 8334(d)(1) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The annuity computed under subsections (a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), and (s) may not exceed 80 percent of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">However, if an employee or Member retiring under section 8337 of this title is receiving retired pay or retainer pay for military service (except that specified in section 8332(c)(1) or (2) of this title) or pension or compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, the annuity of that employee or Member shall be computed under subsection (a), (b), (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s), as appropriate, excluding credit for military service from that computation. If the amount of the annuity so computed, plus the retired or retainer pay which is received, or which would be received but for the pension or compensation from the Department of Veterans Affairs in lieu of such retired or retainer pay, is less than the smaller of the annuity otherwise payable under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection, an amount equal to the difference shall be added to the annuity payable under subsection (a), (b), (c), (n), (q), (r), or (s), as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The annuity computed under subsections (a), (b), (d)(5), and (f) of this section for an employee retiring under section 8336(d), (h), (j), or (<em>o</em>) of this title is reduced by 1/6 of 1 percent for each full month the employee is under 55 years of age at the date of separation. The annuity computed under subsections (c) and (f) of this section for a Member retiring under the second or third sentence of section 8336(g) of this title or the third sentence of section 8338(b) of this title is reduced by 1/12 of 1 percent for each full month not in excess of 60 months, and 1/6 of 1 percent for each full month in excess of 60 months, the Member is under 60 years of age at the date of separation. The annuity computed under subsections (a), (d)(6), and (f) of this section for a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces retiring under the second sentence of section 8336(k) of this title or the third sentence of section 8338(c) of this title is reduced by 1/12 of 1 percent for each full month not in excess of 60 months, and 1/6 of 1 percent for each full month in excess of 60 months, the judge is under 60 years of age at the date of separation.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the employee or Member makes a deposit for such period as provided in section 8334(c) or (d)(1) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) no deposit is required for such service, as provided under section 8334(g) of this title or under any statute.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) The annuity computed under subsections (a)&ndash;(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) (or a portion of the annuity, if jointly designated for this purpose by the employee or Member and the spouse of the employee or Member under procedures prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management) for an employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this subchapter is reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection in order to provide a survivor annuity for the spouse under section 8341(b) of this title, unless the employee or Member and the spouse jointly waive the spouse's right to a survivor annuity in a written election filed with the Office at the time that the employee or Member retires. Each such election shall be made in ac<!-- PDFPage:798 -->cordance with such requirements as the Office shall, by regulation, prescribe, and shall be irrevocable. The Office shall provide, by regulation, that an employee or Member may waive the survivor annuity without the spouse's consent if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the employee or Member to seek the spouse's consent would otherwise be inappropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an employee or Member has a former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity as provided in section 8341(h) of this title, the annuity of the employee or Member computed under subsections (a)&ndash;(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) (or any designated portion of the annuity, in the event that the former spouse is entitled to less than 55 percent of the employee or Member's annuity) is reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An employee or Member who has a former spouse may elect, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to have the annuity computed under subsections (a)&ndash;(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) or a portion thereof reduced as provided in paragraph (4) of this subsection in order to provide a survivor annuity for such former spouse under section 8341(h) of this title, unless all rights to survivor benefits for such former spouse under this subchapter based on marriage to such employee or Member were waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection. An election under this paragraph shall be made at the time of retirement or, if later, within 2 years after the date on which the marriage of the former spouse to the employee or Member is dissolved, subject to a deposit in the Fund by the retired employee or Member of an amount determined by the Office, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such employee or Member would have been reduced if the election had been continuously in effect since the date the annuity commenced, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent. The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under this paragraph by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under this paragraph, except that the total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by the provisions of this paragraph, paragraph (5), or subsection (k)(2) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under this paragraph, shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the entitlement of the former spouse. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under the first sentence of this paragraph. An election under this paragraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall not be effective to the extent that it&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) conflicts with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) any court order or decree referred to in subsection (h)(1) of section 8341 of this title, which was issued before the date of such election; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) any agreement referred to in such subsection which was entered into before such date; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) would cause the total of survivor annuities payable under subsections (b), (d), (f), and (h) of section 8341 of this title based on the service of the employee or Member to exceed 55 percent of the annuity to which the employee or Member is entitled under subsections (a)&ndash;(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s); and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall not be effective, in the case of an employee or Member who is then married, unless it is made with the spouse's written consent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Office shall provide by regulation that subparagraph (B) of this paragraph may be waived for either of the reasons set forth in the last sentence of paragraph (1) of this subsection. In the case of a retired employee or Member whose annuity is being reduced in order to provide a survivor annuity for a former spouse, an election to provide or increase a survivor annuity for any other former spouse (and to continue an appropriate reduction) may be made within the same period that, and subject to the same conditions under which, an election could be made under paragraph (5)(B) of this subsection for a current spouse (subject to the provisions of this paragraph relating to consent of a current spouse, if the retired employee or Member is then married). The opportunity to make an election under the preceding sentence is in addition to any opportunity otherwise afforded under this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In order to provide a survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities under subsections (b), (d), (f), and (h) of section 8341 of this title, the annuity of an employee or Member (or any designated portion or portions thereof) is reduced by 21/2 percent of the first $3,600 thereof plus 10 percent of so much thereof as exceeds $3,600.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for the current spouse of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) after the death of the spouse, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) after the dissolution of the spouse's marriage to the employee or Member, except that an appropriate reduction shall be made thereafter if the spouse is entitled, as a former spouse, to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any reduction in an annuity for the purpose of providing a survivor annuity for a former spouse of a retired employee or Member shall be terminated for each full month after the former spouse remarries before reaching age 55 or dies. This reduction shall be replaced by an appropriate reduction or reductions under para<!-- PDFPage:799 -->graph (4) of this subsection if the retired employee or Member has (i) another former spouse who is entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) of this title, (ii) a current spouse to whom the employee or Member was married at the time of retirement and with respect to whom a survivor annuity was not jointly waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection, or (iii) a current spouse whom the employee or Member married after retirement and with respect to whom an election has been made under subparagraph (C) of this paragraph or subsection (k)(2) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Upon remarriage, a retired employee or Member who was married at the time of retirement (including an employee or Member whose annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the employee or Member's spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement) may irrevocably elect during such marriage, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such remarriage or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) of this title (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the employee or Member's annuity under paragraph (4) of this subsection for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee or Member's spouse in the event such spouse survives the employee or Member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Such election and reduction shall be effective the first day of the second month after the election is received by the Office, but not less than 9 months after the date of the remarriage, and the retired employee or Member shall deposit in the Fund an amount determined by the Office of Personnel Management, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the annuity of such retired employee or Member would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of retirement or, if later, the date the previous reduction in such retired employee or Member's annuity was terminated under subparagraph (A) or (B) of this paragraph, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which an annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect on and after the applicable date referred to in such sentence shall be 6 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under clause (ii) by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under clause (ii), except that total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by the provisions of this paragraph or paragraph (3) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction required by this clause, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under clause (i), shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the marriage. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Notwithstanding any other provision of this subparagraph, an election under this subparagraph may not be made for the purpose of providing an annuity in the case of a spouse by remarriage if such spouse was married to the employee or Member at the time of such employee or Member's retirement, and all rights to survivor benefits for such spouse under this subchapter based on marriage to such employee or Member were then waived under paragraph (1) of this subsection or a similar prior provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) An election to provide a survivor annuity to a person under this subparagraph&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under subsection (k)(1) of this section with respect to such person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under such subsection (k)(1) with respect to a different person, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subparagraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) The deposit provisions of clauses (ii) and (iii) of this subparagraph shall not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the employee or Member makes an election under this subparagraph after having made an election under subsection (k)(1) of this section; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) At the time of retiring under section 8336 or 8338 of this title, an employee or Member who is found to be in good health by the Office may elect a reduced annuity instead of an annuity computed under subsections (a)&ndash;(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) and name in writing an individual having an insurable interest in the employee or Member to receive an annuity under section 8341(c) of this title after the death of the retired employee or Member. The annuity of the employee or Member making the election is reduced by 10 percent, and by 5 percent for each full 5 years the individual named is younger than the retiring employee or Member. However, the total reduction may not exceed 40 percent. An annuity which is reduced under this paragraph or any similar prior provision of law shall, effective the first day of the month following the death of the individual named under this paragraph, be recomputed and paid as if the annuity had not been so reduced. In the case of a married employee or Member, an election under this paragraph on behalf of the spouse may be made only if any right of such spouse to a survivor annuity based on the service of such employee or Member is waived in accordance with subsection (j)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An employee or Member, who is unmarried at the time of retiring under a provision of law which permits election of a reduced annuity with a survivor annuity payable to such employee or Member's spouse and who later marries, may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received in the Office within 2 years after such <!-- PDFPage:800 -->employee or Member marries or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8341(h) of this title (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the retired employee or Member's current annuity as provided in subsection (j) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) The election and reduction shall take effect on the first day of the first month beginning after the expiration of the 9-month period beginning on the date of marriage. Any such election to provide a survivor annuity for a person&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under paragraph (1) of this subsection with respect to such person; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under such paragraph with respect to a different person, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The retired employee or Member shall deposit in the Fund an amount determined by the Office of Personnel Management, as nearly as may be administratively feasible, to reflect the amount by which the retired employee or Member's annuity would have been reduced under subsection (j)(4) of this section since the commencing date of the annuity, if the employee or Member had been married at the time of retirement and had elected to provide a survivor annuity at that time, plus interest. For the purposes of the preceding sentence, the annual rate of interest for each year during which the annuity would have been reduced if the election had been in effect since the date of the annuity commenced shall be 6 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Office shall, by regulation, provide for payment of the deposit required under subparagraph (B)(ii) by a reduction in the annuity of the employee or Member. The reduction shall, to the extent practicable, be designed so that the present value of the future reduction is actuarially equivalent to the deposit required under subparagraph (B)(ii), except that total reductions in the annuity of an employee or Member to pay deposits required by this subsection or subsection (j)(3) shall not exceed 25 percent of the annuity computed under subsections (a) through (i), (n), (q), and (r), including adjustments under section 8340. The reduction required by this subparagraph, which shall be effective on the same date as the election under subparagraph (A), shall be permanent and unaffected by any future termination of the marriage. Such reduction shall be independent of and in addition to the reduction required under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Subparagraphs (B)(ii) and (C) of this paragraph shall not apply if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the employee or Member makes an election under this paragraph after having made an election under paragraph (1) of this subsection; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(m) In computing any annuity under subsections (a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), and (s), the total service of an employee who retires on an immediate annuity or dies leaving a survivor or survivors entitled to annuity includes, without regard to the limitations imposed by subsection (f) of this section, the days of unused sick leave to his credit under a formal leave system, except that these days will not be counted in determining average pay or annuity eligibility under this subchapter. For the purpose of this subsection, in the case of any such employee who is excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 of this title under section 6301(2)(x)&ndash;(xiii) of this title, the days of unused sick leave to his credit include any unused sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from such subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) The annuity of an employee who is a Court of Federal Claims judge, bankruptcy judge, or United States magistrate judge is computed, with respect to service as a Court of Federal Claims judge, as a commissioner of the Court of Claims, as a referee in bankruptcy, as a bankruptcy judge, as a United States magistrate judge, and as a United States commissioner, and with respect to the military service of any such individual (not exceeding 5 years) creditable under section 8332 of this title, by multiplying 21/2 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of that service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount to be deposited with respect to an election under this subsection is an amount equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8343. Additional annuities; voluntary contributions</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an employee or Member may voluntarily contribute additional sums in multiples of $25, but the total may not exceed 10 percent of his basic pay for creditable service after July 31, 1920. The voluntary contribution account in each case is the sum of unrefunded contributions, plus interest at 3 percent a year through December 31, 1984, and thereafter at the rate computed under section 8334(e) of this title, compounded annually to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the date of payment under subsection (d) of this section, separation, or transfer to a position in which he does not continue subject to this subchapter, whichever is earliest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the commencing date fixed for a deferred annuity or date of death, whichever is earlier, in the case of an individual who is separated with title to deferred annuity and does not claim the voluntary contribution account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The voluntary contribution account is used to purchase at retirement an annuity in addition to the annuity otherwise provided. For each $100 in the voluntary contribution account, the additional annuity consists of $7, increased by 20 cents for each full year, if any, the employee or Member is over 55 years of age at the date of retirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A retiring employee or Member may elect a reduced additional annuity instead of the additional annuity described by subsection (b) of this section and designate in writing an individual to receive after his death an annuity of 50 percent of his reduced additional annuity. The additional annuity of the employee or Member making the election is reduced by 10 percent, and by 5 percent for each full 5 years the individual designated is younger than the retiring employee or Member. However, the total reduction may not exceed 40 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A present or former employee or Member is entitled to be paid the voluntary contribution account if he files application for payment with the Office before receiving an additional annuity. An individual who has been paid the voluntary contribution account may not again deposit additional sums under this section until, after a separation from the service of more than 3 calendar days, he again becomes subject to this subchapter.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:826 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) If a present or former employee or Member not retired dies, the voluntary contribution account is paid under section 8342(c) of this title. If all additional annuities or any right thereto based on the voluntary contribution account of a deceased employee or Member terminate before the total additional annuity paid equals the account, the difference is paid under section 8342(c) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations under which any employee or Member who has a life-threatening affliction or other critical medical condition may, at the time of retiring under this subchapter (other than under section 8337 of this title), elect annuity benefits under this section instead of any other benefits under this subchapter (including any benefits under section 8341 of this title) based on the service of the employee or Member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subject to subsection (c), the Office shall by regulation provide for such alternative forms of annuities as the Office considers appropriate, except that among the alternatives offered shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an alternative which provides for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) payment of the lump-sum credit to the employee or Member; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) payment of an annuity to the employee or Member for life; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an employee or Member who is married at the time of retirement, an alternative which provides for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) payment of the lump-sum credit to the employee or Member; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) payment of an annuity to the employee or Member for life, with a survivor annuity payable for the life of a surviving spouse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Each alternative provided for under subsection (b) shall, to the extent practicable, be designed such that the present value of the benefits provided under such alternative (including any lump-sum credit) is actuarially equivalent to the present value of the annuity which would otherwise be provided the employee or Member under this subchapter, as computed under subsections (a)&ndash;(i), (n), (q), (r), and (s) of section 8339.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An employee or Member who, at the time of retiring under this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is married, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section unless a waiver is made under section 8339(j)(1) of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has a former spouse, shall be ineligible to make an election under this section if the former spouse is entitled to benefits under section 8341(h) or 8345(j) of this title (based on the service of the employee or Member) under the terms of a decree of divorce or annulment, or a court order or court-approved property settlement incident to any such decree, with respect to which the Office has been duly notified.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this subchapter and who makes an election under this section may, during the 18-month period beginning on the date of retirement, make the election provided for under section 8339(<em>o</em>) of this title, subject to the deposit requirement thereunder.</p>

Deductions for the Fund may not be withheld from his pay unless the individual elects to have such deductions withheld under subparagraph (A). An amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from his pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under section 5551 of this title. The amounts so deducted shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund. If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis, except as President, for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, in employment not excluding him from coverage under section 8331(1)(i) or (ii) of this title&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8339(j) or section 8339(k)(2) of this title, the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A) of this subsection is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity payable under section 8341(b) of this title is increased by 55 percent of the increase in annuity payable under such subparagraph (A), unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under such subparagraph (A), the annuitant notifies the Office of Personnel Management in writing that he does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed, the survivor annuity payable is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated. If the described employment of the annuitant continues for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, he may elect, instead of the benefit provided by subparagraph (A) of this subsection, to deposit in the Fund (to the extent deposits or deductions have not otherwise been made) an amount computed under section 8334(c) of this title covering that employment and have his rights redetermined under this subchapter. If the annuitant dies while still reemployed and the described employment had continued for at least 5 years, or the equivalent of 5 years in the case of part-time employment, the person entitled to survivor annuity under section 8341(b) of this title may elect to deposit in the Fund and have his rights redetermined under this subchapter.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) If an annuitant, other than a Member receiving an annuity from the Fund, is appointed by the President to a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, or is elected as a Member, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment. Upon separation from such position, an individual whose annuity is so terminated is entitled to have his rights redetermined under this subchapter, except that the amount of the annuity resulting from such redetermination shall be at least equal to the amount of the terminated annuity plus any increases under section 8340 of this title occurring after the termination and before the commencement of the redetermined annuity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If a Member receiving annuity from the Fund becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, annuity payments are discontinued during the employment and resumed on termination of the employment in the amount equal to the sum of the amount of the annuity the member was receiving immediately before the commencement of the employment and the amount of the increases which would have been made in the amount of the annuity under section 8340 of this title during the period of the employment if the annuity had been payable during that period, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the retired Member or Member separated with title to immediate or deferred annuity, who serves at any time after separation as a Member in an appointive position in which he is subject to this subchapter, is entitled, if he so elects, to have his Member annuity computed or recomputed as if the service had been performed before his separation as a Member and the annuity as so computed or recomputed is effective&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) retirement deductions may not be withheld from his pay;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) an amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from his pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under section 5551 of this title; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:829 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the amounts so deducted shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) if the retired Member becomes employed after December 31, 1958, in an appointive position without pay on a full-time or substantially full-time basis, his annuity continues during the employment and is not increased as a result of service performed during the employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the retired Member takes office as Member and gives notice as provided by section 8331(2) of this title, his service as Member during that period shall be credited in determining his right to and the amount of later annuity.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;after July 11, 1960&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;on or after July 12, 1960.&rdquo; In subsection (b)(1), the amendment is made for consistency within the subchapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the codification of 5 U.S.C. 8344 by Public Law 89&ndash;554, the words &ldquo;except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under section 61b of this title&rdquo; were omitted from the third sentence of subsection (a) and from subsection (b)(2)(C) on the basis that they were unnecessary since former 5 U.S.C. 61b [now codified as 5 U.S.C. 5551(a)] provided that a lump-sum leave payment was considered pay for taxation purposes only. This amendment restores to 5 U.S.C. 8344 the language that was so omitted to conform to the source statute (section 13 of the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended) and in recognition that the language was expressly placed in the source statute to overcome certain decisions of the Comptroller General of the United States (see 28 Comp. Gen. 294; 33 id. 591, and 36 id. 209).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) An individual entitled to an annuity from the Fund may make allotments or assignments of amounts from his annuity for such purposes as the Office of Personnel Management in its sole discretion considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) No payment shall be made from the Fund unless an application for benefits based on the service of an employee or Member is received in the Office of Personnel Management before the one hundred and fifteenth anniversary of his birth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, after the death of an employee, Member, or annuitant, no benefit based on his service shall be paid from the Fund unless an application therefor is received in the Office of Personnel Management within 30 years after the death or other event which gives rise to title to the benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) Payments under this subchapter which would otherwise be made to an employee, Member, or annuitant based on service of that individual shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Office to another person if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall only apply to payments made by the Office under this subchapter after the date of receipt in the Office of written notice of such decree, order, other legal process, or agreement, and such additional information and documentation as the Office may prescribe.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;court&rdquo; means any court of any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands, and any Indian court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the term &ldquo;judgment rendered for physically, sexually, or emotionally abusing a child&rdquo; means any legal claim perfected through a final enforceable judgment, which claim is based in whole or in part upon the physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of a child, <!-- PDFPage:835 -->whether or not that abuse is accompanied by other actionable wrongdoing, such as sexual exploitation or gross negligence; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) The Office shall, in accordance with this subsection, enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of a request for agreement from the proper State official. The agreement shall provide that the Office shall withhold State income tax in the case of the monthly annuity of any annuitant who voluntarily requests, in writing, such withholding. The amounts withheld during any calendar quarter shall be held in the Fund and disbursed to the States during the month following that calendar quarter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annuitant may have in effect at any time only one request for withholding under this subsection, and an annuitant may not have more than two such requests in effect during any one calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, an annuitant may change the State designated by that annuitant for purposes of having withholdings made, and may request that the withholdings be remitted in accordance with such change. An annuitant also may revoke any request of that annuitant for withholding. Any change in the State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of the month after the month in which the request or the revocation is processed by the Office, but in no event later than on the first day of the second month beginning after the day on which such request or revocation is received by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not give the consent of the United States to the application of a statute which imposes more burdensome requirements on the United States than on employers generally, or which subjects the United States or any annuitant to a penalty or liability because of this subsection. The Office may not accept pay from a State for services performed in withholding State income taxes from annuities. Any amount erroneously withheld from an annuity and paid to a State by the Office shall be repaid by the State in accordance with regulations issued by the Office.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8348. Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) There is a Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund. The Fund&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is appropriated for the payment of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) benefits as provided by this subchapter or by the provisions of chapter 84 of this title which relate to benefits payable out of the Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) administrative expenses incurred by the Office of Personnel Management in placing in effect each annuity adjustment granted under section 8340 or 8462 of this title, in administering survivor annuities and elections providing therefor under sections 8339 and 8341 of this title or subchapters II and IV of chapter 84 of this title, in administering alternative forms of annuities under sections 8343a and 8420a (and related provisions of law), in making an allotment or assignment made by an individual under section 8345(h) or 8465(b) of this title, and in withholding taxes pursuant to section 3405 of title 26 or section 8345(k) or 8469 of this title;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) is made available, subject to such annual limitation as the Congress may prescribe, for any expenses incurred by the Office in connection with the administration of this chapter, chapter 84 of this title, and other retirement and annuity statutes; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) is made available, subject to such annual limitation as the Congress may prescribe, for any expenses incurred by the Merit Systems Protection Board in the administration of appeals authorized under sections 8347(d) and 8461(e) of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Secretary of the Treasury may accept and credit to the Fund money received in the form of a donation, gift, legacy, or bequest, or otherwise contributed for the benefit of civil-service employees generally.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary shall immediately invest in interest-bearing securities of the United States such currently available portions of the Fund as are not immediately required for payments from the Fund. The income derived from these investments constitutes a part of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The purposes for which obligations of the United States may be issued under chapter 31 of title 31 are extended to authorize the issuance at par of public-debt obligations for purchase by the Fund. The obligations issued for purchase by the Fund shall have maturities fixed with due regard for the needs of the Fund and bear interest at a rate equal to the average market yield computed as of the end of the calendar month next preceding the date of the issue, borne by all marketable interest-bearing obligations of the United States then forming a part of the public <!-- PDFPage:843 -->debt which are not due or callable until after the expiration of 4 years from the end of that calendar month. If the average market yield is not a multiple of 1/8 of 1 percent, the rate of interest on the obligations shall be the multiple of 1/8 of 1 percent nearest the average market yield.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Secretary may purchase other interest-bearing obligations of the United States, or obligations guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the United States, on original issue or at the market price only if he determines that the purchases are in the public interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Any statute which authorizes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) new or liberalized benefits payable from the Fund, including annuity increases other than under section 8340 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) extension of the coverage of this subchapter to new groups of employees; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) increases in pay on which benefits are computed;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">is deemed to authorize appropriations to the Fund to finance the unfunded liability created by that statute, in 30 equal annual installments with interest computed at the rate used in the then most recent valuation of the Civil Service Retirement System and with the first payment thereof due as of the end of the fiscal year in which each new or liberalized benefit, extension of coverage, or increase in pay is effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) At the end of each fiscal year, the Office shall notify the Secretary of the Treasury of the amount equivalent to (1) interest on the unfunded liability computed for that year at the interest rate used in the then most recent valuation of the System, and (2) that portion of disbursement for annuities for that year which the Office estimates is attributable to credit allowed for military service, less an amount determined by the Office to be appropriate to reflect the value of the deposits made to the credit of the Fund under section 8334(j) of this title. Before closing the accounts for each fiscal year, the Secretary shall credit to the Fund, as a Government contribution, out of any money in the Treasury of the United States not otherwise appropriated, the following percentages of such amounts: 10 percent for 1971; 20 percent for 1972; 30 percent for 1973; 40 percent for 1974; 50 percent for 1975; 60 percent for 1976; 70 percent for 1977; 80 percent for 1978; 90 percent for 1979; and 100 percent for 1980 and for each fiscal year thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) In this subsection, the term &ldquo;Postal surplus or supplemental liability&rdquo; means the estimated difference, as determined by the Office, between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the actuarial present value of all future benefits payable from the Fund under this subchapter to current or former employees of the United States Postal Service and attributable to civilian employment with the United States Postal Service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the actuarial present value of deductions to be withheld from the future basic pay of employees of the United States Postal Service currently subject to this subchapter under section 8334;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) that portion of the Fund balance, as of the date the Postal surplus or supplemental liability is determined, attributable to payments to the Fund by the United States Postal Service and its employees, minus benefit payments attributable to civilian employment with the United States Postal Service, plus the earnings on such amounts while in the Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) any other appropriate amount, as determined by the Office in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Not later than June 15, 2007, the Office shall determine the Postal surplus or supplemental liability, as of September 30, 2006. If that result is a surplus, the amount of the surplus shall be transferred to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund established under section 8909a by June 30, 2007.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Office shall redetermine the Postal surplus or supplemental liability as of the close of the fiscal year, for each fiscal year beginning after September 30, 2007, through the fiscal year ending September 30, 2038. If the result is a surplus, that amount shall remain in the Fund until distribution is authorized under subparagraph (C). Beginning June 15, 2017, if the result is a supplemental liability, the Office shall establish an amortization schedule, including a series of annual installments commencing on September 30 of the subsequent fiscal year, which provides for the liquidation of such liability by September 30, 2043.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) As of the close of the fiscal years ending September 30, 2015, 2025, 2035, and 2039, if the result is a surplus, that amount shall be transferred to the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, and any prior amortization schedule for payments shall be terminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Amortization schedules established under this paragraph shall be set in accordance with generally accepted actuarial practices and principles, with interest computed at the rate used in the most recent valuation of the Civil Service Retirement System.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is 1 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by such individual's total service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The annuity of a Member, or former Member with title to a Member annuity, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Member or Congressional employee, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The annuity of a Congressional employee, or former Congressional employee, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Congressional employee or Member, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The annuity of an employee retiring under subsection (d) or (e) of section 8412 or under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 8425 is&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 1 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by so much of such individual's total service as exceeds 20 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The annuity of an air traffic controller or former air traffic controller retiring under section 8412(a) is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as an air traffic controller as defined by section 2109(1)(A)(i), so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to such type of service shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service performed on a part-time basis&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee's actual service, as determined by prorating the employee's total service to reflect the service that was performed on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) if the employee or Member would satisfy the age and service requirements for title to an annuity under section 8412(a), (b), (d)(2), (e)(2), or (f)(2), determined as if the employee or Member had, as of the date of separation, attained the age specified in subparagraph (B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A determination under subparagraph (A) shall be based on how old the employee or Member will be as of the date on which the annuity under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) is to commence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) In applying subsection (a) with respect to an employee under paragraph (2), the percentage applied under such subsection shall be 1.1 percent, rather than 1 percent.</p>

A waiver under this paragraph shall be filed with the Office under procedures prescribed by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this chapter may waive the annuity for a surviving spouse without the spouse's consent if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the employee or Member to seek the spouse's consent would otherwise be inappropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in subsection (d), a waiver made under this subsection shall be irrevocable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Upon remarriage, a retired employee or Member who was married at the time of retirement (including an employee or Member whose annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the employee's or Member's spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement) may irrevocably elect during such marriage, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such remarriage or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the employee's or Member's annuity under section 8419(a) for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee's or Member's spouse in the event such spouse survives the employee or Member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The election and reduction shall be effective the first day of the second month after the election is received by the Office, but not less than 9 months after the date of the remarriage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An election to provide a survivor annuity to an individual under this subsection&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to a different individual, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subsection.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employee or Member was married to such individual at the time of retirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the annuity rights of such individual based on the service of such employee or Member were then waived under subsection (a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) An employee or Member who is unmarried at the time of retiring under this chapter and who later marries may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such employee or Member marries or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the current annuity of the retired employee or Member, in accordance with section 8419(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The election and reduction shall take effect the first day of the first month beginning 9 months after the date of marriage. Any such election to provide a survivor annuity for an individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall prospectively void any election made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to such individual; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall, if an election was made by the employee or Member under section 8420 with respect to a different individual, prospectively void such election if appropriate written application is made by such employee or Member at the time of making the election under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) An employee or Member&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) who is married on the date of retiring under this chapter, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">may, during the 18-month period beginning on such date, elect to have a reduction made under section 8419 in order to provide a survivor annuity under section 8442 for such spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An election under this subsection shall not be effective unless the amount described in subparagraph (B) is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the 18-month period referred to in paragraph (1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The amount to be deposited under this subparagraph is equal to the sum of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the difference (for the period between the date on which the annuity of the former employee or Member commences and the date on which reductions pursuant to the election under this subsection commence) between the amount paid to the former employee or Member from the Fund under this chapter and the amount which would have been paid if such election had been made at the time of retirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the costs associated with providing for the election under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount to be deposited under clause (i) shall include interest, computed at the rate of 6 percent a year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An annuity which is reduced pursuant to an election by a former employee or Member under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage as was in effect under section 8419 as of the date of the employee's or Member's retirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Rights and obligations under this chapter resulting from an election under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the election been made at the time of retirement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) An employee or Member (or former employee or Member) may make an election or change referred to in subparagraph (A) if the employee or Member and the employee's or Member's spouse (or the former employee or Member and the former employee's or Member's spouse) jointly waive, by written election, any right which the spouse may have to a survivor annuity with respect to such employee or Member (or former employee or Member) under section 8434 of this title or subsection (b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not apply to an election or change of election by an employee or Member (or former employee or Member) who establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive Director (at the time of the election or change and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Executive Director)&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(5) Subsections (c) and (d) of section 8445 of this title shall apply to an entitlement of a former spouse to a survivor annuity under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) For the purposes of this section, a court decree, order, or agreement or an election referred to in subsection (a) of this section shall not be effective, in the case of a former spouse, to the extent that the election is inconsistent with any joint waiver previously executed with respect to such former spouse under subsection (a)(2) or (b)(2).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a loan or withdrawal to an employee or Member who establishes to the satisfaction of the Executive Director (at the time the employee or Member applies for such loan or withdrawal and in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Executive Director)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the employee or Member to seek the spouse's consent would otherwise be inappropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an annuity under paragraph (2); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the lump-sum credit, if the widow or widower is the individual who would be entitled to the lump-sum credit and if such widow or widower files application therefor with the Office.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the death of the individual was accidental; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the surviving spouse of the individual had been previously married to such individual and subsequently divorced, and the aggregate time married is at least 9 months.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Subject to paragraph (4), a survivor who is entitled to an annuity under subsection (a) shall also be entitled to a supplementary annuity under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A supplementary annuity under this subsection shall be equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount by which the survivor's assumed CSRS annuity exceeds the annuity payable to such survivor under subsection (a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount determined under paragraph (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount under this paragraph for a survivor is the amount of widow's or widower's insurance benefits which would be payable to such survivor under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to sections 202(e)(7), 202(f)(2), and 203 of such Act) based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant, and determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as of the date on which the annuitant died; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made application for those benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of such Act, as the case may be.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any computation or determination under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Social Security Act, except that in computing any primary insurance amount under section 215 of such Act for purposes of determining an amount under this subsection, subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 8421(b)(2) shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A supplementary annuity under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be payable to a survivor only for calendar months ending before the calendar month in which such survivor first satisfies the minimum age requirement under section 202(e)(1)(B)(i) or 202(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act, as the case may be;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall not be payable to a survivor who would not be entitled to benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of the Social Security Act based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant (determined, as of the date of the annuitant's death, as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made appropriate application for benefits, but without regard to any restriction under either such subsection relating to remarriage); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall not be payable to a survivor for any calendar month in which such survivor is entitled (or would, on proper application, be entitled) to benefits under section 202(g) of the Social Security Act (relating to mother's and father's insurance benefits), or under section 202(e) or (f) of such Act by reason of having become disabled, based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purpose of this subsection, the term &ldquo;assumed CSRS annuity&rdquo;, as used in the case of a survivor, means the amount of the annuity to which such survivor would be entitled under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title based on the service of the deceased annuitant, determined&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as if the survivor had made appropriate application therefor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as if the service of the deceased annuitant were creditable under such subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) An amount payable under this subsection shall be adjusted under section 8462 and shall otherwise be treated under this chapter in the same way as an amount payable under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) If the widow or widower of an annuitant under section 8452 (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a &ldquo;disability annuitant&rdquo;) is determined under subsection (a) to be entitled to an annuity based on the service of such disability annuitant, the annuity of the widow or widower shall be equal to 50 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (2) (or one-half thereof if designated for this purpose under section 8419 of this title), rather than of the amount referred to in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount on which the annuity of the widow or widower of a disability annuitant is based shall be the amount of the annuity to which such disability annuitant was entitled, as computed under section 8452 (including appropriate reduction under subsection (a)(2) of such section and any adjustments under section 8462 allowed under section 8452), as of the day before the date of the disability annuitant's death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In the case of a widow or widower entitled to an annuity based on the service of a disability annuitant who dies before age 62, the amount under clause (ii) shall apply instead of the amount which would otherwise apply under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), the amount of the annuity to which the disability annuitant was entitled as of the day before the date of death shall be considered to be the amount which would be computed with respect to such <!-- PDFPage:918 -->disability annuitant under section 8452(b) if the disability annuitant had attained age 62 on the day before date of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) For purposes of any such computation under section 8452(b)(2) pursuant to this clause, creditable service shall (in addition to the service which would otherwise be used under subparagraph (B)(i) of such section) include the period of time between date of death and the date of the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the annuitant, and average pay shall be adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii) of such section only through date of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The following rules shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The annuity payable under this section to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the annuity which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the annuity payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election made under section 8417(b) or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in section 8445(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount payable under subsection (b)(1)(A) to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under such subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the portion of such amount payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A lump-sum credit under subsection (c)(2) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as apply with respect to a lump-sum credit under section 8424(b).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (c), effective December 1 of any year in which an adjustment under this subsection is to be made, as determined under paragraph (2), each annuity payable from the Fund under this chapter (other than an annuity under section 8443) having a commencing date not later than such December 1 shall be adjusted as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) An adjustment under subsection (b) for any year shall not be effective with respect to the annuity of an annuitant who is under 62 years of age as of the date on which such adjustment would otherwise first take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), this paragraph applies only with respect to an annuitant under section 8412, 8413, or 8414.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of months (not to exceed 12 months, counting any portion of a month as a month) since&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the effective date of the adjustment last made under this section in the annuity of the annuitant on whose service on the widow's or widower's annuity is based; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the annuity of the annuitant (referred to in clause (i)) has not been increased under this section, the commencement date of such annuitant's annuity (determined subject to section 8452(a)(1)(B)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The monthly installment of an annuity after adjustment under this section shall be rounded to the next lowest dollar. However, the monthly installment shall, after adjustment, reflect an increase of at least $1.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The $15,000 amount referred to in section 8442(b)(1)(A)(ii) shall be increased at the same time that, and by the same percent as the percentage by which, annuities under subchapter III of chapter 83 are increased.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If an annuitant, except a disability annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of the annuitant's recovery or restoration of earning capacity, becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, an amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from the annuitant's pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under section 5551. Unless the annuitant's appointment is on an intermittent basis or is to a position as a justice or judge (as defined by section 451 of title 28) or as an employee subject to another retirement system for Government employees, or unless the annuitant is serving as President, deductions for the Fund shall be withheld from the annuitant's pay under section 8422(a) and contributions under section 8423 shall be made. The deductions and contributions referred to in the preceding provisions of this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund. The annuitant's lump-sum credit may not be reduced by annuity paid during the reemployment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, the annuitant's annuity on termination of reemployment shall be increased by an annuity computed under section 8415(a) through (h) as may apply based on the period of reemployment and the basic pay, before deduction, averaged during the reemployment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8419, the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A) is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities payable under section 8442 or 8445 (or both) is increased by 50 percent of the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A), unless, at the time of claim<!-- PDFPage:929 -->ing the increase payable under subparagraph (A), the annuitant notifies the Office in writing that the annuitant does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If an annuitant who is subject to the deductions referred to in subparagraph (A) dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for not less than 1 year of full-time service (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of full-time&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8468_1_target" name="8468_1">1</a></sup> employment), the survivor annuity payable is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for at least 5 years, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 5 years of full-time service, the annuitant may elect, instead of the benefit provided by paragraph (1), to have such annuitant's rights redetermined under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If an annuitant who is subject to the deductions referred to in subparagraph (A) dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 5 years of full-time service (or the equivalent thereof in the case of part-time employment), any person entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8442 or 8445 based on the service of such annuitant shall be permitted to elect, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to have such person's rights under subchapter IV redetermined. A redetermined survivor annuity elected under this subparagraph shall be in lieu of an increased annuity which would otherwise be payable in accordance with paragraph (1)(B)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for a period of less than 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to less than 1 year of full-time service, the total amount withheld under section 8422(a) from the annuitant's basic pay for the period or periods involved shall, upon written application to the Office, be payable to the annuitant (or the appropriate survivor or survivors, determined in the order set forth in section 8424(d)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This section does not apply to an individual appointed to serve as a Governor of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If an annuitant becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by section 451 of title 28, the annuitant may, at any time prior to resignation or retirement from regular active service as such a justice or judge, apply for and be paid, in accordance with section 8424(a), the amount (if any) by which the lump-sum credit exceeds the total annuity paid, notwithstanding the time limitation contained in such section for filing an application for payment.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Office shall, in accordance with this section, enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of a request for agreement from the proper State official. The agreement shall provide that the Office shall withhold State income tax in the case of the monthly annuity of any annuitant who voluntarily requests, in writing, such withholding. The amounts withheld during any calendar quarter shall be held in the Fund and disbursed to the States during the month following that calendar quarter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An annuitant may have in effect at any time only one request for withholding under this section, and an annuitant may not have more than two such requests in effect during any one calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subject to subsection (b), an annuitant may change the State designated by that annuitant for purposes of having withholdings made, and may request that the withholdings be remitted in accordance with such change. An annuitant also may revoke any request of that annuitant for withholding. Any change in the State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of the month after the month in which the request or the revocation is processed by the Office, but in no event later than on the first day <!-- PDFPage:932 -->of the second month beginning after the day on which such request or revocation is received by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This section does not give the consent of the United States to the application of a statute which imposes more burdensome requirements on the United States than on employers generally, or which subjects the United States or any annuitant to a penalty or liability because of this section. The Office may not accept pay from a State for services performed in withholding State income taxes from annuities. Any amount erroneously withheld from an annuity and paid to a State by the Office shall be repaid by the State in accordance with regulations issued by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; means a State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;annuitant&rdquo; includes a survivor who is receiving an annuity from the Fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) An amount payable under subchapter II, IV, or V of this chapter is not assignable, either in law or equity, except under the provisions of section 8465 or 8467, or subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment or other legal process, except as otherwise may be provided by Federal laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Recovery of payments under subchapter II, IV, or V of this chapter may not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of the Office, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Withholding or recovery of money paid under subchapter II, IV, or V of this chapter on account of a certification or payment made by a former employee of the United States in the discharge of his official duties may be made only if the head of the agency on behalf of which the certification or payment was made certifies to the Office that the certification or payment involved fraud on the part of the former employee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) If, within 2 years after the death of the employee, no claim for payment has been filed by a person entitled under the order of precedence named by subsection (a) of this section, and neither the Office nor the administrative office established by the company concerned pursuant to section 8709(b) of this title has received notice that such a claim will be made, payment may be made to the claimant who in the judgment of the Office is equitably entitled thereto, and the payment bars recovery by any other person.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) A policy purchased under this chapter shall contain a provision, approved by the Office of Personnel Management, to the effect that insurance on an employee stops on his separation from the service or 12 months after discontinuance of his pay, whichever is earlier, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office. Justices and judges of the United States described in section 8701(a)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this chapter are deemed to continue in active employment for purposes of this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity and has been insured under this chapter throughout&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of the employee's retirement, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the full period or periods of service during which the employee was entitled to be insured, if fewer than 5 years,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:957 --><p class="statutory-body-block">life insurance, without accidental death and dismemberment insurance, may be continued, under conditions determined by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any employee who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee and has been insured under this chapter throughout&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date the employee becomes entitled to compensation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the full period or periods of service during which the employee was entitled to be insured, if fewer than 5 years,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">life insurance, without accidental death and dismemberment insurance, may be continued, under conditions determined by the Office, during the period the employee is receiving compensation and is held by the Secretary of Labor or the Secretary's delegate to be unable to return to duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of life insurance continued under paragraph (1) or (2) of this subsection shall be continued, with or without reduction, at the end of each full calendar month after the date the employee becomes 65 years of age and is retired or is receiving compensation for disease or injury, in accordance with the employee's written election at the time eligibility to continue insurance during retirement or receipt of compensation arises, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employee may elect to have the deductions required by section 8707 of this title withheld from annuity or compensation, and the employee's life insurance shall be reduced each month by 2 percent of the face value until 25 percent of the amount of life insurance in force before the first reduction remains; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in addition to any deductions which would be required if the insurance were continued as provided under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph, the employee may elect continuous withholdings from annuity or compensation in amounts determined by the Office, and the employee's life insurance coverage shall be either continued without reduction or reduced each month by no more than 1 percent of its face value until no less than 50 percent of the amount of insurance in force before the first reduction remains.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an employee elects to continue insurance under subparagraph (B) of paragraph (3) of this subsection at the time eligibility to continue insurance during retirement or receipt of compensation for disease or injury arises, the individual may later cancel that election and life insurance coverage shall continue as if the individual had originally elected coverage under subparagraph (A) of paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding subsections (a) and (b) of this section, an employee who enters on approved leave without pay to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of employees as defined by section 8701(a) of this title, within 60 days after entering on that leave without pay, may elect to continue his insurance and arrange to pay currently into the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund, through his employing agency, both employee and agency contributions from the beginning of leave without pay. The employing agency shall forward the premium payments to the Fund. If the employee does not so elect, his insurance will continue during nonpay status and stop as provided by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) An employee who enters on approved leave without pay in the circumstances described in paragraph (2) may elect to have such employee's life insurance continue (beyond the end of the 12 months of coverage provided for under subsection (a)) for an additional 12 months and arrange to pay currently into the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund, through such employee's employing agency, both employee and agency contributions, from the beginning of that additional 12 months of coverage. The employing agency shall forward the premium payments to the Fund. If the employee does not so elect, such employee's insurance will continue during nonpay status and stop as provided by subsection (a). An individual making an election under this subsection may cancel that election at any time, in which case such employee's insurance will stop as provided by subsection (a) or upon receipt of notice of cancellation, whichever is later.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) This subsection applies in the case of any employee who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is a member of a reserve component of the armed forces called or ordered to active duty under a call or order that does not specify a period of 30 days or less; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) enters on approved leave without pay to perform active duty pursuant to such call or order.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If the insurance of an employee stops because of separation from the service or suspension without pay, and the separation or suspension is thereafter officially found to have been erroneous, the employee is deemed to have been insured during the period of erroneous separation or suspension. Deductions otherwise required by section 8707 of this chapter shall not be withheld from any backpay awarded for the period of separation or suspension unless death or accidental dismemberment of the employee occurs during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Office, each policy purchased under this chapter shall provide that an insured employee or former employee may make an irrevocable assignment of the employee's or former employee's incidents of ownership in the policy.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or the terms of a court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, may direct that an insured employee or former employee make an irrevocable assignment of the employee's or former employee's incidents of ownership in insurance under this chapter (if there is no previous assignment) to the person specified in the court order or court-approved property settlement agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If the insurance of a former employee receiving a disability annuity under section 8337 of this title stops because of the termination of such annuity, and such annuity is thereafter restored under the second or third sentence of sub<!-- PDFPage:958 -->section (e) of such section, such former employee may, under regulations prescribed by the Office, elect to resume the insurance coverage which was so stopped.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The insurance of an employee under a policy purchased under section 8709 shall not be invalidated based on a finding that the employee erroneously became insured, or erroneously continued insurance upon retirement or entitlement to compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title, if such finding occurs after the erroneous insurance and applicable withholdings have been in force for 2 years during the employee's lifetime.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Subject to subsection (c)(2), during each period in which an employee is insured under a policy purchased by the Office of Personnel Management under section 8709 of this title, there shall be withheld from the employee's pay a share of the cost of the group life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Subject to subsection (c)(2), whenever life insurance continues after an employee retires on an immediate annuity or while the employee is receiving compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided in section 8706(b) of this title, deductions for insurance shall be withheld from the employee's annuity or compensation, except that, in any case in which the insurance is continued as provided in section 8706(b)(3)(A) of this title, the deductions shall not be made for months after the calendar month in which the employee becomes 65 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, insurance shall be so continued without cost (other than as provided under section 8706(b)(3)(B)) to each employee who so retires, or commences receiving compensation, on or before December 31, 1989.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The amount withheld from the pay, annuity, or compensation of each employee subject to insurance deductions shall be at the rate, adjusted to the nearest half-cent, of 662/3 percent of the level cost as determined by the Office for each $1,000 of the employee's basic insurance amount.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee who is subject to withholdings under this section and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue insurance if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system that administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If an agency fails to withhold the proper amount of life insurance deductions from an individual's salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of unpaid deductions may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of unpaid deductions, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the sum of the uncollected deductions and related agency contributions required under section 8708 of this title to the Office for deposit to the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Office shall determine for and in advance of a policy year which companies are eligible to participate as reinsurers and the amount of insurance under a policy which is to be allocated to the issuing company and to reinsurers. The Office shall make this determination at least every 3 years and when a participating company withdraws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Office shall establish a formula under which the amount of insurance retained by an issuing company after ceding reinsurance, and the amount of reinsurance ceded to each reinsurer, is in proportion to the total amount of each company's group life insurance, excluding insurance purchased under this chapter, in force in the United States on the determination date, which is the most recent December 31 for which information is available to the Office. In determining the proportions, the portion of a company's group life insurance in force on the determination date in excess of $100,000,000 shall be reduced by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) A policy purchased under this chapter shall include, for the first policy year, basic tables of premium rates as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) For group life insurance, a schedule of basic premium rates by age which the Office of Personnel Management determines to be consistent with the lowest schedule of basic premium rates generally charged for new group life insurance policies issued to large employers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For group accidental death and dismemberment insurance, a basic premium rate which the Office determines is consistent with the lowest rate generally charged for new group accidental death and dismemberment policies issued to large employers.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The schedule for group life insurance, except as otherwise provided by this section, shall be applied to the distribution by age of the amounts of group life insurance under the policy at its date of issuance to determine an average basic premium rate per $1,000 of life insurance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The policy shall provide that the basic premium rates determined for the first policy year continue for later policy years except as readjusted for a later year based on experience under the policy. The company issuing the policy may make the readjustment on a basis that the Office determines in advance of the policy year is consistent with the general practice of life insurance companies under policies of group life and group accidental death and dismemberment insurance issued to large employers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The policy shall provide that if the Office determines that ascertaining the actual age distribution of the amounts of group life insurance in force at the date of issue of the policy or at the end of the first or any later year of insurance thereunder would not be possible except at a disproportionately high expense, the Office may approve the determination of a tentative average group life premium rate, for the first or any later policy year, instead of using the actual age distribution. The Office, on request by the company issuing the policy, shall redetermine the tentative average premium rate during any policy year, if experience indicates that the assumptions made in determining that rate were incorrect for that year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The policy shall stipulate the maximum expense and risk charges for the first policy year. The Office shall determine these charges on a basis consistent with the general level of charges made by life insurance companies under policies of group life and accidental death and dismemberment insurance issued to large employers. The maximum charges continue from year to year, except that the Office may redetermine them for any year either by agreement with the company issuing the policy or on written notice given to the company at least 1 year before the beginning of the year for which the redetermined maximum charges will be effective.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under the conditions, directives, and terms specified in sections 8709&ndash;8712 of this title, the Office of Personnel Management, without regard to section 5 of title 41, may purchase a policy which shall make available to each insured employee equal amounts of optional life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance in addition to the amounts provided in section 8704(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An employee who is deployed in support of a contingency operation (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(13) of title 10) or an employee of the Department of Defense who is designated as emergency essential under section 1580 of title 10 shall be insured under the policy of insurance under this section if the employee, within 60 days after the date of notification of deployment or designation, elects to be insured under the policy of insurance. An election under this paragraph shall be effective when provided to the Office in writing, in the form prescribed by the Office, within such 60-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The optional life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance shall be made available to each insured employee under such conditions as the Office shall prescribe and in amounts approved by the Office but not more than the greater of $10,000 or an amount which, when added to the amount provided in section 8704(a) of this title, makes the sum of his insurance equal to his annual pay.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the optional insurance on an employee stops on his separation from service or 12 months after discontinuance of his pay, whichever is earlier, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity and has been insured under this section throughout&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of such retirement, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the full period or periods of service during which the employee was entitled to be insured, if less than 5 years,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the amount of optional life insurance only which has been in force throughout such period may be continued, under conditions determined by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In the case of any employee who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee and has been insured under this section throughout&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date such employee becomes entitled to such compensation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the full period or periods of service during which the employee was entitled to be insured, if less than 5 years,</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">the amount of optional life insurance only which has been in force throughout such period may be continued, under conditions determined by the Office, during the period the employee is receiving such compensation for disease or injury and is held by the Secretary of Labor or his delegate to be unable to return to duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The amount of optional life insurance continued under subparagraph (A) or subparagraph (B) of this paragraph shall be reduced by 2 percent at the end of each full calendar month after the date the employee becomes 65 years of age and is retired or is receiving compensation for disease or injury. The Office shall prescribe minimum amounts, not less than 25 percent of the amount of life insurance in force before the first reduction, to which the insurance may be reduced.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (c)(1) of this section,<sup><a href="#8714a_1_target" name="8714a_1">1</a></sup> a justice or judge of the United States as defined by section 8701(a)(5) of this title who resigns his office without meeting the requirements of section 371(a) of title 28, United States Code, for continuation of the judicial salary shall have the right to convert regular optional life insurance coverage issued under this section during his judicial service to an individual pol<!-- PDFPage:966 -->icy of life insurance under the same conditions approved by the Office governing conversion of basic life insurance coverage for employees eligible as provided in section 8706(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) During each period in which an employee has the optional insurance the full cost thereof shall be withheld from his pay. During each period in which an employee continues optional life insurance after retirement or while in receipt of compensation for work injuries, as provided in section 8706(b) of this title, the full cost thereof shall be withheld from his annuity or compensation, except that, at the end of the calendar month in which he becomes 65 years of age, the optional life insurance shall be without cost to him. Amounts so withheld shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided in section 8714 of this title and shall be reported and accounted for separately from amounts withheld and contributed under sections 8707 and 8708 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an agency fails to withhold the proper cost of optional insurance from an individual's salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of amounts properly due may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of any unpaid amount, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the uncollected amount to the Office for deposit to the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee who is subject to withholdings under this subsection and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue optional insurance if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system which administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The cost of the optional insurance shall be determined from time to time by the Office on the basis of such age groups as it considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The amount of optional life, or life and accidental death, insurance in force on an employee at the date of his death shall be paid as provided in section 8705 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under the conditions, directives, and terms specified in sections 8709 through 8712 of this title, the Office of Personnel Management, without regard to section 5 of title 41, may purchase a policy which shall make available to each employee insured under section 8702 of this title amounts of additional optional life insurance (without accidental death and dismemberment insurance). An employee may elect coverage under this section without regard to whether the employee has elected coverage under optional insurance available under section 8714a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) An employee who is deployed in support of a contingency operation (as that term is defined in section 101(a)(13) of title 10) or an employee of the Department of Defense who is designated as emergency essential under section 1580 of title 10 shall be insured under the policy of insurance under this section if the employee, within 60 days after the date of notification of deployment or designation, elects to be insured under the policy of insurance. An election under this paragraph shall be effective when provided to the Office in writing, in the form prescribed by the Office, within such 60-day period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The additional optional insurance provided under this section shall be made available to each eligible employee who has elected coverage under this section, under conditions the Office shall prescribe, in multiples, at the employee's election, of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times the annual rate of basic pay payable to the employee (rounded to the next higher multiple of $1,000). An employee may reduce or stop coverage elected pursuant to this section at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the additional optional insurance elected by an employee pursuant to this section shall stop on separation from service or 12 months after discontinuance of his pay, whichever is earlier, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office. Justices and judges of the United States described in section 8701(a)(5)(ii) and (iii) of this chapter are deemed to continue in active employment for purposes of this chapter. A justice or judge of the United States as defined by section 8701(a)(5) of this title who resigns his office without meeting the requirements of section 371(a) of title 28, United States Code, for continuation of the judicial salary shall have the right to convert additional optional life insurance coverage issued under this section during his judicial service to an individual policy of life insurance under the same conditions approved by the Office governing conversion of basic life insurance coverage for employees eligible as provided in section 8706(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, so much of the additional optional insurance as has been in force for not less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of retirement or entitlement to compensation, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the full period or periods of service during which the insurance was available to the employee, if fewer than 5 years,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:968 --><p class="statutory-body-block">may be continued under conditions determined by the Office after retirement or while the employee is receiving compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title and is held by the Secretary of Labor (or the Secretary's delegate) to be unable to return to duty.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall be continued, with or without reduction, in accordance with the employee's written election at the time eligibility to continue insurance during retirement or receipt of compensation arises, as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The employee may elect to have withholdings cease in accordance with subsection (d), in which case&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall be reduced each month by 2 percent effective at the beginning of the second calendar month after the date the employee becomes 65 years of age and is retired or is in receipt of compensation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the reduction under clause (i) shall continue for 50 months at which time the insurance shall stop.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) The employee may, instead of the option under subparagraph (A), elect to have the full cost of additional optional insurance continue to be withheld from such employee's annuity or compensation on and after the date such withholdings would otherwise cease pursuant to an election under subparagraph (A), in which case the amount of additional optional insurance continued under paragraph (2) shall not be reduced, subject to paragraph (4).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) An employee who does not make any election under the preceding provisions of this paragraph shall be treated as if such employee had made an election under subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) If an employee makes an election under paragraph (3)(B), that individual may subsequently cancel such election, in which case additional optional insurance shall be determined as if the individual had originally made an election under paragraph (3)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) An employee whose additional optional insurance under this section would otherwise stop in accordance with paragraph (1) and who is not eligible to continue insurance under paragraph (2) may elect, under conditions prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to continue all or a portion of so much of the additional optional insurance as has been in force for not less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of the event which would cause insurance to stop under paragraph (1); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the full period or periods of service during which the insurance was available to the employee, if fewer than 5 years,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">at group rates established for purposes of this section, in lieu of conversion to an individual policy. The amount of insurance continued under this paragraph shall be reduced by 50 percent effective at the beginning of the second calendar month after the date the employee or former employee attains age 70 and shall stop at the beginning of the second calendar month after attainment of age 80, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office. Alternatively, insurance continued under this paragraph may be reduced or stopped at any time the employee or former employee elects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) When an employee or former employee elects to continue additional optional insurance under this paragraph following separation from service or 12 months without pay, the insured individual shall submit timely payment of the full cost thereof, plus any amount the Office determines necessary to cover associated administrative expenses, in such manner as the Office shall prescribe by regulation. Amounts required under this subparagraph shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided under section 8714 and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under section 8714a(d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Subject to clause (ii), no election to continue additional optional insurance may be made under this paragraph 3 years after the effective date of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) On and after the date on which an election may not be made under clause (i), all additional optional insurance under this paragraph for former employees shall terminate, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to an individual policy of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) During each period in which the additional optional insurance is in force on an employee the full cost thereof shall be withheld from the employee's pay. During each period in which an employee continues additional optional insurance after retirement or while in receipt of compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the full cost thereof shall be withheld from the former employee's annuity or compensation, except that, if insurance is continued as provided under subsection (c)(3)(A), beginning at the end of the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age, the additional optional life insurance shall be without cost to the former employee. Amounts so withheld (and any amounts withheld as provided in subsection (c)(3)(B)) shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided in section 8714 of this title and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under section 8714a(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an agency fails to withhold the proper cost of additional optional insurance from an individual's salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of amounts properly due may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of any unpaid amount, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the uncollected amount to the Office for deposit to the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee who is subject to withholdings under this subsection and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such with<!-- PDFPage:969 -->holdings may nevertheless continue additional optional insurance if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system which administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The cost of the additional optional insurance shall be determined from time to time by the Office on the basis of the employee's age relative to such age groups as the Office establishes under section 8714a(e) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The amount of additional optional life insurance in force on an employee at the date of his death shall be paid as provided in section 8705 of this title.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under the conditions, directives, and terms specified in sections 8709 through 8712 of this title, the Office of Personnel Management, without regard to section 5 of title 41, may purchase a policy which shall make available to each employee insured under section 8702 of this title amounts of optional life insurance (without accidental death and dismemberment insurance) on the employee's family members.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The optional life insurance on family members provided under this section shall be made available to each eligible employee who has elected coverage under this section, under conditions the Office shall prescribe, in multiples, at the employee's election, of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 times&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $5,000 for a spouse; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:970 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $2,500 for each child described under section 8701(d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee may reduce or stop coverage elected pursuant to this section at any time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the optional life insurance on family members shall stop at the earlier of the employee's death, the employee's separation from the service, or 12 months after discontinuance of pay, subject to a provision for temporary extension of life insurance coverage and for conversion to individual policies of life insurance under conditions approved by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In the case of any employee who retires on an immediate annuity or who becomes entitled to receive compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee and who has had in force insurance under this section for no less than&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the 5 years of service immediately preceding the date of retirement or entitlement to compensation, or</p>

During each period in which an employee continues optional life insurance on family members after retirement or while in receipt of compensation under subchapter I of chapter 81 of this title because of disease or injury to the employee, as provided in subsection (c) of this section, the full cost shall be withheld from the annuity or compensation, except that, beginning at the end of the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age, the optional life insurance on family members shall be without cost to the employee. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the full cost shall be continued after the calendar month in which the former employee becomes 65 years of age if, and for so long as, an election under this section corresponding to that described in section 8714b(c)(3)(B) remains in effect with respect to such former employee. Amounts so withheld shall be deposited, used, and invested as provided in section 8714 of this title and shall be reported and accounted for together with amounts withheld under section 8714a(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an agency fails to withhold the proper cost of optional life insurance on family members from an individual's salary, compensation, or retirement annuity, the collection of amounts properly due may be waived by the agency if, in the judgment of the agency, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. However, if the agency so waives the collection of any unpaid amount, the agency shall submit an amount equal to the uncollected amount to the Office for deposit to the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee who is subject to withholdings under this subsection and whose pay, annuity, or compensation is insufficient to cover such withholdings may nevertheless continue optional life insurance on family members if the employee arranges to pay currently into the Employees&rsquo; Life Insurance Fund, through the agency or retirement system that administers pay, annuity, or compensation, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this subsection.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purpose of this section, an individual shall be considered to be &ldquo;terminally ill&rdquo; if such individual has a medical prognosis that such individual's life expectancy is 9 months or less.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations under which any individual covered by group life insurance under section 8704(a) may, if such individual is terminally ill, elect to receive a lump-sum payment equal to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the full amount of insurance under section 8704(a) (or portion thereof designated for this purpose under subsection (d)(4)) which would otherwise be payable under this chapter (on the establishment of a valid claim)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) computed based on a date determined under regulations of the Office (but not later than 30 days after the date on which the individual's application for benefits under this section is approved or deemed approved under subsection (d)(3)); and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">reduced by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an amount necessary to assure that there is no increase in the actuarial value of the benefit paid (as determined under regulations of the Office).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If a lump-sum payment is taken under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) no insurance under the provisions of section 8704(a) or (b) shall be payable based on the death or any loss of the individual involved, unless the lump-sum payment represents only a portion of the total benefits which could have been taken, in which case benefits under those provisions shall remain in effect, except that the basic insurance amount on which they are based&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) shall be reduced by the percentage which the designated portion comprised relative to the total benefits which could have been taken (rounding the result to the nearest multiple of $1,000 or, if midway between multiples of $1,000, to the next higher multiple of $1,000); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) shall not be subject to further adjustment; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual who takes a lump-sum payment under this section (whether full or partial) remains eligible for optional benefits under sections 8714a&ndash;8714c (subject to payment of the full cost of those benefits in accordance with applicable provisions of the section or sections involved, to the same extent as if no election under this section had been made).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In order to ascertain the reliability of any medical opinion or finding submitted as part of an application under this section, the covered individual may be required to submit to a medical examination under the direction of the agency or entity considering the application. The individual shall not be liable for the costs associated with any examination required under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any decision by the reviewing agency or entity with respect to an application for benefits under this section (including one relating to an individual's medical prognosis) shall not be subject to administrative review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) An individual making an election under this section may designate that only a limited portion (expressed as a multiple of $1,000) of the total amount otherwise allowable under this section be paid pursuant to such election.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Office of Personnel Management may contract with qualified carriers offering plans described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title, without regard to section 5 of title 41 or other statute requiring competitive bidding. Each contract shall be for a uniform term of at least 1 year, but may be made automatically renewable from term to term in the absence of notice of termination by either party.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:979 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) To be eligible as a carrier for the plan described by section 8903(2) of this title, a company must be licensed to issue group health insurance in all the States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A contract for a plan described by section 8903(1) or (2) of this title shall require the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to reinsure with other companies which elect to participate, under an equitable formula based on the total amount of their group health insurance benefit payments in the United States during the latest year for which the information is available, to be determined by the carrier and approved by the Office; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to allocate its rights and obligations under the contract among its affiliates which elect to participate, under an equitable formula to be determined by the carrier and the affiliates and approved by the Office.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each contract under this chapter shall contain a detailed statement of benefits offered and shall include such maximums, limitations, exclusions, and other definitions of benefits as the Office considers necessary or desirable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Office may prescribe reasonable minimum standards for health benefits plans described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title and for carriers offering the plans. Approval of a plan may be withdrawn only after notice and opportunity for hearing to the carrier concerned without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of this title. The Office may terminate the contract of a carrier effective at the end of the contract term, if the Office finds that at no time during the preceding two contract terms did the carrier have 300 or more employees and annuitants, exclusive of family members, enrolled in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A contract may not be made or a plan approved which excludes an individual because of race, sex, health status, or, at the time of the first opportunity to enroll, because of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A contract may not be made or a plan approved which does not offer to each employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title whose enrollment in the plan is ended, except by a cancellation of enrollment, a temporary extension of coverage during which he may exercise the option to convert, without evidence of good health, to a nongroup contract providing health benefits. An employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title who exercises this option shall pay the full periodic charges of the nongroup contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The benefits and coverage made available under subsection (g) of this section are noncancelable by the carrier except for fraud, over-insurance, or nonpayment of periodic charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Rates charged under health benefits plans described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title shall reasonably and equitably reflect the cost of the benefits provided. Rates under health benefits plans described by section 8903(1) and (2) of this title shall be determined on a basis which, in the judgment of the Office, is consistent with the lowest schedule of basic rates generally charged for new group health benefit plans issued to large employers. The rates determined for the first contract term shall be continued for later contract terms, except that they may be readjusted for any later term, based on past experience and benefit adjustments under the later contract. Any readjustment in rates shall be made in advance of the contract term in which they will apply and on a basis which, in the judgment of the Office, is consistent with the general practice of carriers which issue group health benefit plans to large employers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Each contract under this chapter shall require the carrier to agree to pay for or provide a health service or supply in an individual case if the Office finds that the employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title is entitled thereto under the terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) When a contract under this chapter requires payment or reimbursement for services which may be performed by a clinical psychologist, optometrist, nurse midwife, nursing school administered clinic, or nurse practitioner/clinical specialist, licensed or certified as such under Federal or State law, as applicable, or by a qualified clinical social worker as defined in section 8901(11), an employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title covered by the contract shall be free to select, and shall have direct access to, such a clinical psychologist, qualified clinical social worker, optometrist, nurse midwife, nursing school administered clinic, or nurse practitioner/nurse clinical specialist without supervision or referral by another health practitioner and shall be entitled under the contract to have payment or reimbursement made to him or on his behalf for the services performed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to preclude a health benefits plan from providing direct access or direct payment or reimbursement to a provider in a health care practice or profession other than a practice or profession listed in paragraph (1), if such provider is licensed or certified as such under Federal or State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to comprehensive medical plans as described in section 8903(4) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) The Office shall contract under this chapter for a plan described in section 8903(4) of this title with any qualified health maintenance carrier which offers such a plan. For the purpose of this subsection, &ldquo;qualified health maintenance carrier&rdquo; means any qualified carrier which is a qualified health maintenance organization within the meaning of section 1310(d)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8902_1_target" name="8902_1">1</a></sup> of title XIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300c&ndash;9(d)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m)(1) The terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, if a contract under <!-- PDFPage:980 -->this chapter provides for the provision of, the payment for, or the reimbursement of the cost of health services for the care and treatment of any particular health condition, the carrier shall provide, pay, or reimburse up to the limits of its contract for any such health service properly provided by any person licensed under State law to provide such service if such service is provided to an individual covered by such contract in a State where 25 percent or more of the population is located in primary medical care manpower shortage areas designated pursuant to section 332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not apply to contracts entered into providing prepayment plans described in section 8903(4) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) A contract for a plan described by section 8903(1), (2), or (3), or section 8903a, shall require the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to implement hospitalization-cost-containment measures, such as measures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for verifying the medical necessity of any proposed treatment or surgery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for determining the feasibility or appropriateness of providing services on an outpatient rather than on an inpatient basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for determining the appropriate length of stay (through concurrent review or otherwise) in cases involving inpatient care; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) involving case management, if the circumstances so warrant; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to establish incentives to encourage compliance with measures under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) A contract may not be made or a plan approved which includes coverage for any benefit, item, or service for which funds may not be used under the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) In making a determination relating to the appropriateness of imposing or the period of any debarment under this section (where such debarment is not mandatory), or the appropriateness of imposing or the amount of any civil penalty or assessment under this section, the Office shall take into account&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses or improper conduct of the provider involved; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a debarment shall be effective with respect to any health care services or supplies furnished by a provider on or after the effective date of such provider's debarment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any notice of debarment referred to in paragraph (1) shall specify the date as of which debarment becomes effective and the minimum period of time for which such debarment is to remain effective. In the case of a debarment under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection (b), the minimum period of debarment shall not be less than 3 years, except as provided in paragraph (4)(B)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A provider barred from participating in the program under this chapter may, after the expiration of the minimum period of debarment referred to in paragraph (3), apply to the Office, in such manner as the Office may by regulation prescribe, for termination of the debarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Office may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant to an application filed by such provider after the end of the minimum debarment period, if the Office determines, based on the conduct of the applicant, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) there is no basis under subsection (b), (c), or (d) for continuing the debarment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) there are reasonable assurances that the types of actions which formed the basis for the original debarment have not recurred and will not recur; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notwithstanding any provision of subparagraph (A), terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant to an application filed by such provider before the end of the minimum debarment period, if the Office determines that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) early termination under this clause is warranted based on the fact that the provider is the sole community provider or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community, or other similar circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Office shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promptly notify the appropriate State or local agency or authority having responsibility for the licensing or certification of a provider barred from participation in the program under this chapter of the fact of the debarment, as well as the reasons for such debarment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) request that appropriate investigations be made and sanctions invoked in accordance with applicable law and policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) request that the State or local agency or authority keep the Office fully and currently informed with respect to any actions taken in response to the request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Any provider of health care services or supplies that is the subject of an adverse determination by the Office under this section shall be entitled to reasonable notice and an opportunity to request a hearing of record, and to judicial review as provided in this subsection after the Office renders a final decision. The Office shall grant a request for a hearing upon a showing that due process rights have not previously been afforded with respect to any finding of fact which is relied upon as a cause for an adverse determination under this section. Such hearing shall be conducted without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of this title by a hearing officer who shall be designated by the Director of the Office and who shall not otherwise have been involved in the adverse determination being appealed. A request for a hearing under this subsection shall be filed within such period and in accordance with such procedures as the Office shall prescribe by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any provider adversely affected by a final decision under paragraph (1) made after a hearing to which such provider was a party may seek review of such decision in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the plaintiff resides or has his or her principal place of business by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 60 days after the date the decision is issued, and by simultaneously sending copies of such notice by certified mail to the Director of the Office and to the Attorney General. In answer to the appeal, the Director of the Office shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the transcript of the record, if the Office conducted a hearing, and other evidence upon which the findings and decision complained of are based. The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and evidence of record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the decision of the Office, with or without remanding the case for a rehearing. The district court shall not set aside or remand the decision of the Office unless there is not substantial evidence on the record, taken as whole, to support the findings by the Office of a cause for action under this section or unless action taken by the Office constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Matters that were raised or that could have been raised in a hearing under paragraph (1) or an appeal under paragraph (2) may not be raised as a defense to a civil action by the United States to collect a penalty or assessment imposed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A civil action to recover civil monetary penalties or assessments under subsection (d) shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the United States, and may be brought in the United States district court for the district where the claim involved was presented or where the person subject to the penalty resides. Amounts recovered under this section shall be paid to the Office for deposit into the Employees Health Benefits Fund. The amount of a penalty or assessment as finally determined by the Office, or other amount the Office may agree to in compromise, may be deducted from any sum then or later owing by the United States to the party against whom the penalty or assessment has been levied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which, with respect to services or supplies furnished by a debarred provider to a covered individual during the period of such provider's de<!-- PDFPage:985 -->barment, payment or reimbursement under this chapter may be made, notwithstanding the fact of such debarment, if such individual did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known of the debarment. In any such instance, the carrier involved shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the individual is informed of the debarment and the minimum period of time remaining under the terms of the debarment.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">provide a period of not less than 3 weeks during which any employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title enrolled in a health benefits plan described by such section shall be permitted to transfer that individual's enrollment to another such plan or to cancel such enrollment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In addition to any opportunity afforded under paragraph (1) of this subsection, an employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter shall be permitted to transfer that individual's enrollment to another such plan, or to cancel such enrollment, at such other times and subject to such conditions as the Office may prescribe in regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In addition to any informational requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter, the regulations shall include provisions to ensure that each employee eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this chapter (whether actually enrolled or not) is notified in writing as to the rights afforded under section 8905a of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) An unenrolled employee who is required by a court or administrative order to provide health insurance coverage for a child who meets the requirements of section 8901(5) may enroll for self and family coverage in a health benefits plan under this chapter. If such employee fails to enroll for self and family coverage in a health benefits plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child resides, and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall enroll the employee in a self and family enrollment in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefit Plan.</p>

If such employee fails to change to a self and family enrollment and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall change the enrollment of the employee to a self and family enrollment in the plan in which the employee is enrolled if that plan provides full benefits and services in the location where the child resides. If the plan in which the employee is enrolled does not provide full benefits and services in the location in which the child resides, or, if the employee fails to change to a self and family enrollment in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location where the child resides, the employing agency shall change the coverage of the employee to a self and family enrollment in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefits Plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The employee may not discontinue the self and family enrollment in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child resides for so long as the court or administrative order remains in effect and the child continues to meet the requirements of section 8901(5), unless the employee provides documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Not later than October 1 of each year, the Office of Personnel Management shall determine the weighted average of the subscription charges that will be in effect during the following contract year with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enrollments under this chapter for self alone; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) enrollments under this chapter for self and family.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining each weighted average under paragraph (1), the weight to be given to a particular subscription charge shall, with respect to each plan (and option) to which it is to apply, be commensurate with the number of enrollees enrolled in such plan (and option) as of March 31 of the year in which the determination is being made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;enrollee&rdquo; means any individual who, during the contract year for which the weighted average is to be used under this section, will be eligible for a Government contribution for health benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the biweekly Government contribution for health benefits for an employee or annuitant enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter is adjusted to an amount equal to 72 percent of the weighted average under subsection (a)(1)(A) or (B), as applicable. For an employee, the adjustment begins on the first day of the employee's first pay period of each year. For an annuitant, the adjustment begins on the first day of the first period of each year for which an annuity payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The biweekly Government contribution for an employee or annuitant enrolled in a plan under this chapter shall not exceed 75 percent of the subscription charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of an employee who is occupying a position on a part-time career employment basis (as defined in section 3401(2) of this title), the biweekly Government contribution shall be equal to the percentage which bears the same ratio to the percentage determined under this subsection (without regard to this paragraph) as the average number of hours of such employee's regularly scheduled workweek bears to the average number of hours in the regularly scheduled workweek of an employee serving in a comparable position on a full-time career basis (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Office).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of persons who are enrolled in a health benefits plan as part of the demonstration project under section 1108 of title 10, the Government contribution shall be subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (i) of that section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) The amount necessary to pay the total charge for enrollment, after the Government contribution is deducted, shall be withheld from the pay of each enrolled employee and (except as provided in subsection (i) of this section) from the annuity of each enrolled annuitant.

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1)(A) An employee enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter who is placed in a leave without pay status may have his coverage and the coverage of members of his family continued under the plan for not to exceed 1 year under regulations prescribed by the Office.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if necessary, the head of the employing agency shall approve advance payment, recoverable in the same manner as under section 5524a(c), of a portion of basic pay sufficient to pay current employee contributions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Each agency shall establish procedures for accepting direct payments of employee contributions for the purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee who enters on approved leave without pay to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of employees as defined by section 8901 of this title, within 60 days after entering on that leave without pay, may file with his employing agency an election to continue his health benefits enrollment and arrange to pay currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund, through his employing agency, both employee and agency contributions from the beginning of leave without pay. The employing agency shall forward the enrollment charges so paid to the <!-- PDFPage:996 -->Fund. If the employee does not so elect, his enrollment will continue during nonpay status and end as provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection and implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An employing agency may pay both the employee and Government contributions, and any additional administrative expenses otherwise chargeable to the employee, with respect to health care coverage for an employee described in subparagraph (B) and the family of such employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An employee referred to in subparagraph (A) is an employee who&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) serves on active duty for a period of more than 30 consecutive days.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding the one-year limitation on coverage described in paragraph (1)(A), payment may be made under this paragraph for a period not to exceed 24 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Government contribution, and any additional payments under subsection (e)(3)(A), for health benefits for an employee shall be paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of employees generally, from the appropriation or fund which is used to pay the employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an elected official, from an appropriation or fund available for payment of other salaries of the same office or establishment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of an employee of the legislative branch who is paid by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, from the applicable accounts of the House of Representatives; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of an employee in a leave without pay status, from the appropriation or fund which would be used to pay the employee if he were in a pay status.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the Government contributions authorized by this section for health benefits for an annuitant shall be paid from annual appropriations which are authorized to be made for that purpose and which may be made available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Government contributions authorized by this section for health benefits for an individual who first becomes an annuitant by reason of retirement from employment with the United States Postal Service on or after July 1, 1971, or for a survivor of such an individual or of an individual who died on or after July 1, 1971, while employed by the United States Postal Service, shall through September 30, 2016, be paid by the United States Postal Service, and thereafter shall be paid first from the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund up to the amount contained in the Fund, with any remaining amount paid by the United States Postal Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining any amount for which the Postal Service is liable under this paragraph, the amount of the liability shall be prorated to reflect only that portion of total service which is attributable to civilian service performed (by the former postal employee or by the deceased individual referred to in subparagraph (A), as the case may be) after June 30, 1971, as estimated by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Government contribution for persons enrolled in a health benefits plan as part of the demonstration project under section 1108 of title 10 shall be paid as provided in subsection (i) of that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Office shall provide for conversion of biweekly rates of contribution specified by this section to rates for employees and annuitants paid on other than a biweekly basis, and for this purpose may provide for the adjustment of the converted rate to the nearest cent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) An annuitant whose annuity is insufficient to cover the withholdings required for enrollment in a particular health benefits plan may enroll (or remain enrolled) in such plan, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the annuitant elects, under conditions prescribed by regulations of the Office, to pay currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund, through the retirement system that administers the annuitant's health benefits enrollment, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8909. Employees Health Benefits Fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) There is in the Treasury of the United States an Employees Health Benefits Fund which is administered by the Office of Personnel Management. The contributions of enrollees and the Government described by section 8906 of this title shall be paid into the Fund. The Fund is available&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) without fiscal year limitation for all payments to approved health benefits plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay expenses for administering this chapter within the limitations that may be specified annually by Congress.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments from the Fund to a plan participating in a letter-of-credit arrangement under this chapter shall, in connection with any payment or reimbursement to be made by such plan for a health service or supply, be made, to the maximum extent practicable, on a checks-presented basis (as defined under regulations of the Department of the Treasury).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Portions of the contributions made by enrollees and the Government shall be regularly set aside in the Fund as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A percentage, not to exceed 1 percent of all contributions, determined by the Office to be reasonably adequate to pay the administrative expenses made available by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For each health benefits plan, a percentage, not to exceed 3 percent of the contributions toward the plan, determined by the Office to be reasonably adequate to provide a contingency reserve.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Office, from time to time and in amounts it considers appropriate, may transfer unused funds for administrative expenses to the contingency reserves of the plans then under contract with the Office. When funds are so transferred, each contingency reserve shall be credited in proportion to the total amount of the subscription charges paid and accrued to the plan for the contract term immediately before the contract term in which the transfer is made. The income derived from dividends, rate adjustments, or other refunds made by a plan shall be credited to its contingency reserve. The contingency reserves may be used to defray increases in future rates, or may be applied to reduce the contributions of enrollees and the Government to, or to increase the benefits provided by, the plan from which the reserves are derived, as the Office from time to time shall determine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of the Treasury may invest and reinvest any of the money in the Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, and may sell these obligations for the purposes of the Fund. The interest on and the proceeds from the sale of these obligations become a part of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When the assets, liabilities, and membership of employee organizations sponsoring or underwriting plans approved under section 8903(3) or 8903a of this title are merged, the assets (including contingency reserves) and liabilities of the plans sponsored or underwritten by the merged organizations shall be transferred at the beginning of the contract term next following the date of the merger to the plan sponsored or underwritten by the successor organization. Each employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title affected by a merger shall be transferred to the plan sponsored or underwritten by the successor organization unless he enrolls in another plan under this chapter. If the successor organization is an organization described in section 8901(8)(B) of this title, any employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title so transferred may not remain enrolled in the plan after the end of the contract term in which the merger occurs unless that individual is a full member of such organization (as determined under section 8903a(d) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided by subsection (d) of this section, when a plan described by section 8903(3) or (4) or 8903a of this title is discontinued under this chapter, the contingency reserve of that plan shall be credited to the contingency reserves of the plans continuing under this chapter for the contract term following that in which termination occurs, each reserve to be credited in proportion to the amount of the subscription charges paid and accrued to the plan for the year of termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any crediting required under paragraph (1) pursuant to the discontinuation of any plan under this chapter shall be completed by the end of the second contract year beginning after such plan is so discontinued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Office shall prescribe regulations in accordance with which this subsection shall be applied in the case of any plan which is discontinued before being credited with the full amount to which it would otherwise be entitled based on the discontinuation of any other plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) No tax, fee, or other monetary payment may be imposed, directly or indirectly, on a carrier or an underwriting or plan administration subcontractor of an approved health benefits plan by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority thereof, with respect to any payment made from the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to exempt any carrier or underwriting or plan administration subcontractor of an approved health benefits plan from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, fee, or other monetary pay<!-- PDFPage:1002 -->ment on the net income or profit accruing to or realized by such carrier or underwriting or plan administration subcontractor from business conducted under this chapter, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The fund described in subsection (a) is available to pay costs that the Office incurs for activities associated with implementation of the demonstration project under section 1108 of title 10.</p>
