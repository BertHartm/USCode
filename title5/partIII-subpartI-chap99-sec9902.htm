<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations Relating to Pay.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Nothing in this section shall constitute authority to modify the pay of any employee who serves in an Executive Schedule position under subchapter II of chapter 53.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Separation pay, if paid in installments, shall cease to be paid upon the recipient's acceptance of employment by the Federal Government, or commencement of work under a personal services contract as described in paragraph (6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6)(A) An employee who receives separation pay under such program may not be reemployed by the Department of Defense for a 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the employee's separation, unless this prohibition is waived by the Secretary on a case-by-case basis.</p>
