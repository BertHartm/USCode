<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1006 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations Relating to Pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Nothing in this section shall constitute authority to modify the pay of any employee who serves in an Executive Schedule position under subchapter II of chapter 53.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) With respect to any parts of the proposal as to which recommendations have been made but not accepted by the Secretary and the Director, at any time after 30 calendar days have elapsed since the initiation of the congressional notification, consultation, and mediation procedures set forth in subparagraph (B), if the Secretary, in his discretion, determines that further consultation and mediation is unlikely to produce agreement, the Secretary may implement any or all of such parts (including any modifications made in response to the recommendations as the Secretary determines advisable), but only after 30 days have elapsed after notifying Congress of the decision to implement the part or parts involved (as so modified, if applicable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The Secretary shall notify Congress promptly of the implementation of any part of the proposal and shall furnish with such notice an explanation of the proposal, any changes made to the proposal as a result of recommendations from the employee representatives, and of the reasons why implementation is appropriate under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If a proposal described in subparagraph (A) is implemented, the Secretary and the Director shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1007 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) develop a method for the employee representatives to participate in any further planning or development which might become necessary; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any bargaining completed pursuant to this subsection with a labor organization not otherwise having national consultation rights with the Department of Defense or its subcomponents shall not create any obligation on the Department of Defense or its subcomponents to confer national consultation rights on such a labor organization.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall have the right to petition the full Merit Systems Protection Board for review of the record of that decision pursuant to regulations established under paragraph (2).

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the waiver of any provision of law, including an appeals provision providing a right or remedy under section 2302(b) (1), (8) or (9), that is not otherwise waivable under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The right of an employee to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board of the Department's final decision on an action covered by paragraph (4) of this subsection, and the right of the Merit Systems Protection Board to review such action or to order corrective action pursuant to paragraph (5), is provisional for 7 years after the date of the enactment of this chapter, and shall become permanent unless Congress acts to revise such provisions.</p>

This authority is in addition to, and notwithstanding, any other authorities established by law or regulation for such programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may not authorize the payment of voluntary separation incentive pay under paragraph (1) to more than 25,000 employees in any fiscal year, except that employees who receive voluntary separation incentive pay as a result of a closure or realignment of a military installation under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (title XXIX of Public Law 101&ndash;510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) shall not be included in that number.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An employee who is at least 50 years of age and has completed 20 years of service, or has at least 25 years of service, may, pursuant to regulations promulgated under this section, apply and be retired from the Department of Defense and receive benefits in accordance with chapter 83 or 84 if the employee has been employed continuously within the Department of Defense for more than 30 days before the date on which the determination to conduct a reduction or restructuring within 1 or more Department of Defense components is approved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $25,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Separation pay shall not be a basis for payment, and shall not be included in the computation, of any other type of Government benefit. Separation pay shall not be taken into account for the purpose of determining the amount of any severance pay to which an individual may be entitled under section 5595, based on any other separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Separation pay, if paid in installments, shall cease to be paid upon the recipient's acceptance of employment by the Federal Government, or commencement of work under a personal services contract as described in paragraph (6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) An employee who receives separation pay under such program may not be reemployed by the Department of Defense for a 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the employee's separation, unless this prohibition is waived by the Secretary on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An employee who receives separation pay under this section on the basis of a separation occurring on or after the date of the enactment of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (Public Law 103&ndash;236;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#9902_1_target" name="9902_1">1</a></sup> 108 Stat. 111) and accepts employment with the Government of the United States, or who commences work through a personal services contract with the United States within 5 years after the date of the separation on which payment of the separation pay is based, shall be required to repay the entire amount of the separation pay to the Department of Defense. If the employment is with an Executive agency (as defined by section 105) other than the Department of Defense, the Director may, at the request of the head of that agency, waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment is within the Department of De<!-- PDFPage:1009 -->fense, the Secretary may waive the repayment if the individual involved is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment is with an entity in the legislative branch, the head of the entity or the appointing official may waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to an organizational or functional unit that includes more than 300,000 civilian employees of the Department of Defense, if the Secretary determines in accordance with subsection (a) that the Department has in place a performance management system that meets the criteria specified in subsection (b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(m) <cap-smallcap>Labor Management Relations in the Department of Defense</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Notwithstanding section 9902(d)(2), the Secretary, together with the Director, may establish and from time to time adjust a labor relations system for the Department of Defense to address the unique role that the Department's civilian workforce plays in supporting the Department's national security mission.</p>
