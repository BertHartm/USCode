<p class="statutory-body">(a) An agency shall accord exclusive recognition to a labor organization if the organization has been selected as the representative, in a secret ballot election, by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit who cast valid ballots in the election.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) If a petition is filed with the Authority&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by any person alleging&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) in the case of an appropriate unit for which there is no exclusive representative, that 30 percent of the employees in the appropriate unit wish to be represented for the purpose of collective bargaining by an exclusive representative, or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Authority shall investigate the petition, and if it has reasonable cause to believe that a question of representation exists, it shall provide an opportunity for a hearing (for which a transcript shall be kept) after a reasonable notice. If the Authority finds on the record of the hearing that a question of representation exists, the Authority shall supervise or conduct an election on the question by secret ballot and shall certify the results thereof. An election under this subsection shall not be conducted in any appropriate unit or in any subdivision thereof within which, in the preceding 12 calendar months, a valid election under this subsection has been held.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A labor organization which&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) from labor organizations on the ballot, that labor organization which the employees wish to have represent them; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) not to be represented by a labor organization.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In any election in which no choice on the ballot receives a majority of the votes cast, a runoff election shall be conducted between the two choices receiving the highest number of votes.

<p class="statutory-body">(e) A labor organization seeking exclusive recognition shall submit to the Authority and the agency involved a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its constitution and bylaws, and a statement of its objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Exclusive recognition shall not be accorded to a labor organization&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:585 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if the Authority determines that the labor organization is subject to corrupt influences or influences opposed to democratic principles;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) if the Authority has, within the previous 12 calendar months, conducted a secret ballot election for the unit described in any petition under this section and in such election a majority of the employees voting chose a labor organization for certification as the unit's exclusive representative.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) if agreement is reached, to execute on the request of any party to the negotiation a written document embodying the agreed terms, and to take such steps as are necessary to implement such agreement.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) If any agency or labor organization is charged by any person with having engaged in or engaging in an unfair labor practice, the General Counsel shall investigate the charge and may issue and cause to be served upon the agency or labor organization a complaint. In any case in which the General Counsel does not issue a complaint because the charge fails to state an unfair labor practice, the General Counsel shall provide the person making the charge a written statement of the reasons for not issuing a complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any complaint under paragraph (1) of this subsection shall contain a notice&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) of the charge;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that a hearing will be held before the Authority (or any member thereof or before an individual employed by the authority and designated for such purpose); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) of the time and place fixed for the hearing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The labor organization or agency involved shall have the right to file an answer to the original and any amended complaint and to appear in person or otherwise and give testimony at the time and place fixed in the complaint for the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, no complaint shall be issued based on any alleged unfair labor practice which occurred more than 6 months before the filing of the charge with the Authority.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If the General Counsel determines that the person filing any charge was prevented from filing the charge during the 6-month period referred to in subparagraph (A) of this paragraph by reason of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any failure of the agency or labor organization against which the charge is made to perform a duty owed to the person, or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) any concealment which prevented discovery of the alleged unfair labor practice during the 6-month period,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the General Counsel may issue a complaint based on the charge if the charge was filed during the 6-month period beginning on the day of the discovery by the person of the alleged unfair labor practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The General Counsel may prescribe regulations providing for informal methods by which the alleged unfair labor practice may be resolved prior to the issuance of a complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Authority (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Authority and designated for such purpose) shall conduct a hearing on the complaint not earlier than 5 days <!-- PDFPage:590 -->after the date on which the complaint is served. In the discretion of the individual or individuals conducting the hearing, any person involved may be allowed to intervene in the hearing and to present testimony. Any such hearing shall, to the extent practicable, be conducted in accordance with the provisions of subchapter II of chapter 5 of this title, except that the parties shall not be bound by rules of evidence, whether statutory, common law, or adopted by a court. A transcript shall be kept of the hearing. After such a hearing the Authority, in its discretion, may upon notice receive further evidence or hear argument.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) If the Authority (or any member thereof or any individual employed by the Authority and designated for such purpose) determines after any hearing on a complaint under paragraph (5) of this subsection that the preponderance of the evidence received demonstrates that the agency or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, then the individual or individuals conducting the hearing shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue and cause to be served on the agency or labor organization an order&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to cease and desist from any such unfair labor practice in which the agency or labor organization is engaged;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) requiring the parties to renegotiate a collective bargaining agreement in accordance with the order of the Authority and requiring that the agreement, as amended, be given retroactive effect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) requiring reinstatement of an employee with backpay in accordance with section 5596 of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) including any combination of the actions described in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of this paragraph or such other action as will carry out the purpose of this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">If any such order requires reinstatement of an employee with backpay, backpay may be required of the agency (as provided in section 5596 of this title) or of the labor organization, as the case may be, which is found to have engaged in the unfair labor practice involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) If the individual or individuals conducting the hearing determine that the preponderance of the evidence received fails to demonstrate that the agency or labor organization named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in an unfair labor practice, the individual or individuals shall state in writing their findings of fact and shall issue an order dismissing the complaint.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In connection with any matter before the Authority in any proceeding under this section, the Authority may request, in accordance with the provisions of section 7105(i) of this title, from the Director of the Office of Personnel Management an advisory opinion concerning the proper interpretation of rules, regulations, or other policy directives issued by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An agency shall only accord recognition to a labor organization that is free from corrupt influences and influences opposed to basic democratic principles. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, an organization is not required to prove that it is free from such influences if it is subject to governing requirements adopted by the organization or by a national or international labor organization or federation of labor organizations with which it is affiliated, or in which it participates, containing explicit and detailed provisions to which it subscribes calling for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the maintenance of democratic procedures and practices including provisions for periodic elections to be conducted subject to recognized safeguards and provisions defining and securing the right of individual members to participate in the affairs of the organization, to receive fair and equal treatment under the governing rules of the organization, and to receive fair process in disciplinary proceedings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the exclusion from office in the organization of persons affiliated with communist or other totalitarian movements and persons identified with corrupt influences;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the prohibition of business or financial interests on the part of organization officers and agents which conflict with their duty to the organization and its members; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the maintenance of fiscal integrity in the conduct of the affairs of the organization, including provisions for accounting and financial controls and regular financial reports or summaries to be made available to members.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding the fact that a labor organization has adopted or subscribed to standards of conduct as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the organization is required to furnish evidence of its freedom from corrupt influences or influences opposed to basic democratic principles if there is reasonable cause to believe that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the organization has been suspended or expelled from, or is subject to other sanction, by a parent labor organization, or federation of organizations with which it had been affiliated, because it has demonstrated an unwillingness or inability to comply with governing requirements comparable in purpose to those required by subsection (a) of this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the organization is in fact subject to influences that would preclude recognition under this chapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A labor organization which has or seeks recognition as a representative of employees under this chapter shall file financial and other reports with the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor Management Relations, provide for bonding of officials and employees of the organization, and comply with trusteeship and election standards.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Assistant Secretary shall prescribe such regulations as are necessary to carry out the purposes of this section. Such regulations shall conform generally to the principles applied to labor organizations in the private sector. Complaints of violations of this section shall be filed with the Assistant Secretary. In any matter arising under this section, the Assistant Secretary may require a labor organization to cease and desist from violations of this section and require it to take such actions as he considers appropriate to carry out the policies of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This chapter does not authorize participation in the management of a labor organization or acting as a representative of a labor organization by a management official, a supervisor, or a confidential employee, except as specifically provided in this chapter, or by an employee if the participation or activity would result in a conflict or apparent conflict of interest or would otherwise be incompatible with law or with the official duties of the employee.</p>
