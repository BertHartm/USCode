<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may settle the accounts of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an employee for whose account payment has been made under sections 5562, 5563, and 5565 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a survivor of a casualty to a ship, station, or military installation which results in the loss or destruction of disbursing records.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:474 --><p class="statutory-body-block">That settlement is conclusive on the accounting officials of the United States in settling the accounts of disbursing officials.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Payment or settlement of an account made pursuant to a report, determination, or finding of death may not be recovered or reopened because of a later report or determination which fixes a date of death. However, an account shall be reopened and settled on the basis of a date of death so fixed which is later than that used as a basis for earlier settlement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) In settling the accounts of a disbursing official, he is entitled to credit for an erroneous payment or overpayment made by him in carrying out this subchapter, except section 5568, if there is no fraud or criminality by him. Recovery may not be made from an individual who authorizes a payment under this subchapter, except section 5568, if there is no fraud or criminality by him.</p>
