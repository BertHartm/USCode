<p class="statutory-body">(b) For the purpose of this subchapter an employee is deemed employed for a full biweekly pay period if he is employed during the days within that period, exclusive of holidays and nonworkdays established by Federal statute, Executive order, or administrative order, which fall within his basic administrative workweek.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A part-time employee, unless otherwise excepted, is entitled to the benefits provided by subsection (d) of this section and sections 6303, 6304(a), (b), 6305(a), 6307, and 6310 of this title on a pro rata basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The annual leave provided by this subchapter, including annual leave that will accrue to an employee during the year, may be granted at any time during the year as the head of the agency concerned may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If an officer excepted from this subchapter by section 6301(2)(x)&ndash;(xiii) of this title, without a break in service, again becomes subject to this subchapter on completion of his service as an excepted officer, the unused annual and sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from this subchapter is deemed to have remained to his credit.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) one day for each full biweekly pay period for an employee with 15 or more years of service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining years of service, an employee is entitled to credit for all service of a type that would be creditable under section 8332, regardless of whether or not the employee is covered by subchapter III of chapter 83, and for all service which is creditable by virtue of subsection (e). However, an employee who is a retired member of a uniformed service as defined by section 3501 of this title is entitled to credit for active military service only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) his retirement was based on disability&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, an employee whose current employment is limited to less than 90 days is entitled to annual leave under this subchapter only after being currently employed for a continuous period of 90 days under successive appointments without a break in service. After completing the 90-day period, the employee is entitled to be credited with the leave that would have accrued to him under subsection (a) of this section except for this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A change in the rate of accrual of annual leave by an employee under this section takes effect at the beginning of the pay period after the pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, in which the employee completed the prescribed period of service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was performed in a position the duties of which directly relate to the duties of the position to which such employee is so appointed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) meets such other requirements as the Office may prescribe; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the judgment of the head of the appointing agency, the application of this subsection is necessary in order to achieve an important agency mission or performance goal.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An employee shall not be eligible for the application of paragraph (1) on the basis of any appointment if, within 90 days before the effective date of such appointment, such employee has held any position in the civil service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the rate of accrual of annual leave under subsection (a) shall be 1 day for each full biweekly pay period in the case of any employee who holds a position which is subject to&mdash;</p>
