<p class="note-body">The authority of the President to prescribe rules is added on authority of former section 633(1), which is carried into section 3302. The section is rewritten as a general prohibition instead of specifying each of the personnel actions to which the prohibition applies. The words &ldquo;in an Executive agency or in the competitive service&rdquo; are added for clarity. The sentence &ldquo;All Acts or parts of Acts inconsistent herewith are repealed.&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
