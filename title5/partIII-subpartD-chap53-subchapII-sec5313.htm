<p class="note-body">The proviso in paragraph (15) of former section 2211(b) is carried into section 5314. The remainder of paragraph (15) is omitted but not repealed, see table III. The part of paragraph (15) that is omitted but not repealed provides that the position of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall be in Level II of the Federal Executive Salary Schedule so long as the position is held by the incumbent of the position on August 14, 1964. The omission of this provision from title 5, without repealing the corresponding provision of the source statute, in effect leaves existing statute unchanged insofar as it relates to the present incumbent of the position of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
