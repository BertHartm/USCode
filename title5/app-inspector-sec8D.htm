<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Notwithstanding the last two sentences of section 3(a), the Inspector General shall be under the authority, direction, and control of the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to <!-- PDFPage:22 -->audits or investigations, or the issuance of subpenas, which require access to sensitive information concerning&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ongoing criminal investigations or proceedings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) undercover operations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the identity of confidential sources, including protected witnesses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) deliberations and decisions on policy matters, including documented information used as a basis for making policy decisions, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to have a significant influence on the economy or market behavior;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) intelligence or counterintelligence matters; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) other matters the disclosure of which would constitute a serious threat to national security or to the protection of any person or property authorized protection by section 3056 of title 18, United States Code, section 202 of title 3, United States Code, or any provision of the Presidential Protection Assistance Act of 1976 (18 U.S.C. 3056 note; Public Law 94&ndash;524).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) With respect to the information described under paragraph (1), the Secretary of the Treasury may prohibit the Inspector General from carrying out or completing any audit or investigation, or from issuing any subpena, after such Inspector General has decided to initiate, carry out, or complete such audit or investigation or to issue such subpena, if the Secretary determines that such prohibition is necessary to prevent the disclosure of any information described under paragraph (1) or to prevent significant impairment to the national interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If the Secretary of the Treasury exercises any power under paragraph (1) or (2), the Secretary of the Treasury shall notify the Inspector General in writing stating the reasons for such exercise. Within 30 days after receipt of any such notice, the Inspector General shall transmit a copy of such notice to the Committees on Governmental Affairs and Finance of the Senate and the Committees on Government Operations and Ways and Means of the House of Representatives, and to other appropriate committees or subcommittees of the Congress.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In carrying out the duties and responsibilities specified in this Act, the Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury shall have oversight responsibility for the internal investigations performed by the Office of Internal Affairs of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, the Office of Internal Affairs of the United States Customs Service, and the Office of Inspections of the United States Secret Service, and the internal audits and internal investigations performed by the Office of Assistant Commissioner (Inspection) of the Internal Revenue Service. The head of each such office shall promptly report to the Inspector General the significant activities being carried out by such office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Notwithstanding subsection (b), the Inspector General may initiate, conduct and supervise such audits and investigations in the Department of the Treasury (including the bureaus and services referred to in subsection (b)) as the Inspector General considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If the Inspector General initiates an audit or investigation under subsection (c) concerning a bureau or service referred to in subsection (b), the Inspector General may provide the head of the office of such bureau or service referred to in subsection (b) with written notice that the Inspector General has initiated such an audit or investigation. If the Inspector General issues a notice under the preceding sentence, no other audit or investigation shall be initiated into the matter under audit or investigation by the Inspector General and any other audit or investigation of such matter shall cease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) The Inspector General shall have access to returns and return information, as defined in section 6103(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 6103(b)], only in accordance with the provisions of section 6103 of such Code [26 U.S.C. 6103] and this Act.</p>

If the Inspector General determines that the Inspection Service of the Internal Revenue Service should not be made aware of a notice of access to returns and return information, such notice shall be provided to the Senior Deputy Commissioner of Internal Revenue.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Such notice shall clearly indicate the specific returns or return information being accessed, contain a certification by the Inspector General, or in the absence of the Inspector General, the Acting Inspector General, the Deputy Inspector General, the Assistant Inspector General for Audits, or the Assistant Inspector General for Investigations, that the returns or return information being accessed are needed for a purpose described under section 6103(h)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 6103(h)(1)], and identify those employees of the Office of Inspector General of the Department of the Treasury who may receive such returns or return information.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) The Internal Revenue Service shall maintain the same system of standardized records or accountings of all requests from the Inspector General for inspection or disclosure of returns and return information (including the reasons for and dates of such requests), and of returns and return information inspected or disclosed pursuant to such requests, as described under section 6103(p)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 [26 U.S.C. 6103(p)(3)(A)].
