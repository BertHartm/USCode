<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (5), an employee or Member shall be allowed credit for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be entitled, upon filing appropriate application therefor with the Office, to a refund equal to the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the amount deposited with respect to such period under such section 8334(j) (or prior provision), excluding interest; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) the amount which would otherwise have been required with respect to such period under paragraph (1)(B).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) whose death occurs before separation from the service,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">creditable service of the deceased employee or Member shall include each period of military service includable under subparagraph (A) or (B) <!-- PDFPage:794 -->of paragraph (1) or under paragraph (3). In carrying out this subparagraph, any amount deposited under section 8422(e)(5) shall be taken into account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A survivor annuity computed based on an amount which, under authority of subparagraph (A), takes into consideration any period of military service shall be reduced by the amount of any survivor's benefits&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) payable to a survivor (other than a child) under a retirement system for members of the uniformed services;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if, or to the extent that, such benefits are based on such period of military service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph, including regulations under which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) a survivor may elect not to be covered by this paragraph; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) this paragraph shall be carried out in any case which involves a former spouse.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If, after January 1, 1997, an employee or Member waives retired pay that is subject to a court order for which there has been effective service on the Secretary concerned for purposes of section 1408 of title 10, the military service on which the retired pay is based may be credited as service for purposes of this chapter only if the employee or Member authorizes the Director to deduct and withhold from the annuity payable to the employee or Member under this subchapter an amount equal to the amount that, if the annuity payment was instead a payment of the employee's or Member's retired pay, would have been deducted and withheld and paid to the former spouse covered by the court order under such section 1408. The amount deducted and withheld under this paragraph shall be paid to that former spouse. The period of civil service employment by the employee or Member shall not be taken into consideration in determining the amount of the deductions and withholding or the amount of the payment to the former spouse. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Credit under this chapter shall be allowed for leaves of absence without pay granted an employee while performing military service, or while receiving benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81. An employee or former employee who returns to duty after a period of separation is deemed, for the purpose of this subsection, to have been on leave of absence without pay for that part of the period in which that individual was receiving benefits under subchapter I of chapter 81. Credit may not be allowed for so much of other leaves of absence without pay as exceeds 6 months in the aggregate in a calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Credit shall be allowed for periods of approved leave without pay granted an employee to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of employees (as defined by section 8331(1) or 8401(11)), subject to the employee arranging to pay, through the employee's employing agency, within 60 days after commencement of such leave without pay, amounts equal to the retirement deductions and agency contributions which would be applicable under sections 8422(a) and 8423(a), respectively, if the employee were in pay status. If the election and all payments provided by this subsection are not made, the employee may not receive credit for the periods of leave without pay, notwithstanding the third sentence of subsection (d).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) An employee or Member who has received a refund of retirement deductions under subchapter III of chapter 83 with respect to any service described in subsection (b)(2) or (b)(3) may not be allowed credit for such service under this chapter unless such employee or Member deposits an amount equal to 1.3 percent of basic pay for such service, with interest. A deposit under this paragraph may be made only with respect to a refund received pursuant to an application filed with the Office before the date on which the employee or Member first becomes subject to this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee or Member may not be allowed credit under this chapter for any service described in subsection (b)(3) for which retirement deductions under subchapter III of chapter 83 have not been made, unless such employee or Member deposits an amount equal to 1.3 percent of basic pay for such service, with interest.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Interest under paragraph (1) or (2) shall be computed in accordance with paragraphs (2) and (3) of section 8334(e) and regulations prescribed by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purpose of survivor annuities, deposits authorized by the preceding provisions of this subsection may also be made by a survivor of an employee or Member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any employee who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) served in a position in which the employee was excluded from coverage under this subchapter because the employee was covered under a retirement system established under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) transferred without a break in service to a position to which the employee was appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, and in which position the employee is subject to this subchapter,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall be treated for all purposes of this subchapter as if any service that would have been creditable under the retirement system established under section 10 of the Federal Reserve Act was service performed while subject to this subchapter if any employee and employer deductions, contributions or rights with respect to the employee's service are transferred from such retirement system to the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) An employee or Member shall be allowed credit for service as a volunteer or volunteer leader under part A of title VIII of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as a full-time volunteer enrolled in a program of at least 1 year's duration under part A, B, or C of title I of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act of 1973, or as a volunteer or volunteer leader under the Peace Corps Act performed at any time prior to the separation on which the entitlement to any annuity under this subchapter is based if the employee or Member has made a deposit with interest, if any, with respect to such service under section 8422(f).</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as otherwise provided in this section, the annuity of an employee retiring under this subchapter is 1 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by such individual's total service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The annuity of a Member, or former Member with title to a Member annuity, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Member or Congressional employee, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The annuity of a Congressional employee, or former Congressional employee, retiring under this subchapter is computed under subsection (a), except that if the individual has had at least 5 years of service as a Congressional employee or Member, or any combination thereof, so much of the annuity as is computed with respect to either such type of service (or a combination thereof), not exceeding a total of 20 years, shall be computed by multiplying 17/10 percent of the individual's average pay by the years of such service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The annuity of an employee retiring under subsection (d) or (e) of section 8412 or under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of section 8425 is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) 17/10 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by so much of such individual's total service as does not exceed 20 years; plus</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 1 percent of that individual's average pay multiplied by so much of such individual's total service as exceeds 20 years.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In computing an annuity under this subchapter for an employee whose service includes service performed on a part-time basis&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the average pay of the employee, to the extent that it includes pay for service performed in any position on a part-time basis, shall be determined by using the annual rate of basic pay that would be payable for full-time service in the position; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the benefit so computed shall then be multiplied by a fraction equal to the ratio which the employee's actual service, as determined by prorating the employee's total service to reflect the service that was performed <!-- PDFPage:799 -->on a part-time basis, bears to the total service that would be creditable for the employee if all of the service had been performed on a full-time basis.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of this subsection, employment on a part-time basis shall not be considered to include employment on a temporary or intermittent basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The annuity of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) is computed in accordance with applicable provisions of this section, except that the annuity shall be reduced by five-twelfths of 1 percent for each full month by which the commencement date of the annuity precedes the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the employee or Member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Paragraph (1) does not apply in the case of an employee or Member retiring under section 8412(g) or 8413(b) if the employee or Member would satisfy the age and service requirements for title to an annuity under section 8412(a), (b), (d)(2), (e)(2), or (f)(2), determined as if the employee or Member had, as of the date of separation, attained the age specified in subparagraph (B).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) If an employee or Member is married at the time of retiring under this chapter, the reduction described in section 8419(a) shall be made unless the employee or Member and the spouse jointly waive, by written election, any right which the spouse may have to a survivor annuity under section 8442 based on the service of such employee or Member. A waiver under this paragraph shall be filed with the Office under procedures prescribed by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1), an employee or Member who is married at the time of retiring under this chapter may waive the annuity for a surviving spouse without the spouse's consent if the employee or Member establishes to the satisfaction of the Office (in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the spouse's whereabouts cannot be determined; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that, due to exceptional circumstances, requiring the employee or Member to seek the spouse's consent would otherwise be inappropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as provided in subsection (d), a waiver made under this subsection shall be irrevocable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Upon remarriage, a retired employee or Member who was married at the time of retirement (including an employee or Member whose annuity was not reduced to provide a survivor annuity for the employee's or Member's spouse or former spouse as of the time of retirement) may irrevocably elect during such marriage, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such remarriage or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the <!-- PDFPage:800 -->employee's or Member's annuity under section 8419(a) for the purpose of providing an annuity for such employee's or Member's spouse in the event such spouse survives the employee or Member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The election and reduction shall be effective the first day of the second month after the election is received by the Office, but not less than 9 months after the date of the remarriage.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An election to provide a survivor annuity to an individual under this subsection&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any election under this subsection made by an employee or Member on behalf of an individual after the retirement of such employee or Member shall not be effective if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employee or Member was married to such individual at the time of retirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the annuity rights of such individual based on the service of such employee or Member were then waived under subsection (a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) An employee or Member who is unmarried at the time of retiring under this chapter and who later marries may irrevocably elect, in a signed writing received by the Office within 2 years after such employee or Member marries or, if later, within 2 years after the death or remarriage of any former spouse of such employee or Member who was entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8445 (or of the last such surviving former spouse, if there was more than one), a reduction in the current annuity of the retired employee or Member, in accordance with section 8419(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The election and reduction shall take effect the first day of the first month beginning 9 months after the date of marriage. Any such election to provide a survivor annuity for an individual&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) who is married on the date of retiring under this chapter, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">may, during the 18-month period beginning on such date, elect to have a reduction made under section 8419 in order to provide a survivor annuity under section 8442 for such spouse.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An election under this subsection shall not be effective unless the amount described in subparagraph (B) is deposited into the Fund before the expiration of the 18-month period referred to in paragraph (1).</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the costs associated with providing for the election under this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The amount to be deposited under clause (i) shall include interest, computed at the rate of 6 percent a year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An annuity which is reduced pursuant to an election by a former employee or Member under this subsection shall be reduced by the same percentage as was in effect under section 8419 as of the date of the employee's or Member's retirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Rights and obligations under this chapter resulting from an election under this subsection shall be the same as the rights and obligations which would have resulted had the election been made at the time of retirement.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Subject to paragraph (3), an individual shall, if and while entitled to an annuity under subsection (a), (b), (d), or (e) of section 8412, or under section 8414(c), also be entitled to an annuity supplement under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Subject to paragraph (3), an individual shall, if and while entitled to an annuity under section 8412(f), or under subsection (a) or (b) of section 8414, also be entitled to an annuity supplement under this section if such individual is at least the applicable minimum retirement age under section 8412(h), except that an individual entitled to an annuity under section 8414(a) for failure to be recertified as a senior executive shall be entitled to an annuity supplement without regard to such applicable minimum retirement age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An individual whose entitlement to an annuity under section 8412 or 8414 does not commence before age 62 is not entitled to an annuity supplement under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An individual entitled to an annuity supplement under this section ceases to be so entitled after the last day of the month preceding the first month for which such individual would, on proper application, be entitled to old-age insurance benefits under title II of the Social Security Act, but not later than the last day of the month in which such individual attains age 62.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The amount of the annuity supplement of an annuitant under this section for any month shall be equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an amount determined under paragraph (2), multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a fraction, as described in paragraph (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount under this paragraph for an annuitant is an amount equal to the old-age insurance benefit which would be payable to such annuitant under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to sections 203, 215(a)(7), and 215(d)(5) of such Act) upon attaining age 62 and filing application therefor, determined as if the annuitant had attained such age and filed application therefor, and were a fully insured individual (as defined in section 214(a) of such Act), on January 1 of the year in which such annuitant's entitlement to any payment under this section commences, except that the reduction of such old-age insurance benefit under section 202(q) of such Act shall be the maximum applicable for an individual born in the same year as the annuitant. In computing the primary insurance amount under section 215 of such Act for purposes of this paragraph, the number of elapsed years (referred to in section 215(b)(2)(B)(iii) of such Act and used to compute the number of benefit computation years) shall not include years beginning with the year in which such annuitant's entitlement to any payment under this section commences, and&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for a benefit computation year after age 21 which precedes the separation referred to in subparagraph (B), and during which the individual did not perform a full year of service, the total wages and self-employment income of such annuitant for such year shall be deemed to have been an amount equal to the product of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the average total wages of all workers for that year, multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(I) the numerator of which is the total basic pay of the individual for service performed in the first year thereafter in which such individual performed a full year of service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(II) the denominator of which is the average total wages of all workers for the year referred to in subclause (I).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:804 --><p class="statutory-body">(3) The fraction under this paragraph for any annuitant is a fraction&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the numerator of which is the annuitant's total years of service (rounding a fraction to the nearest whole number, with 1/2 being rounded to the next higher number), not to exceed the number under subparagraph (B); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the denominator of which is 40.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) For the purpose of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;benefit computation year&rdquo; has the meaning provided in section 215(b)(2)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the term &ldquo;average total wages of all workers&rdquo;, for a year, means the average of the total wages, as defined and computed under section 215(b)(3)(A)(ii)(I) of the Social Security Act for such year; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the term &ldquo;service&rdquo; does not include military service.</p>
