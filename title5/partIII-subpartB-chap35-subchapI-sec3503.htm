<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;a function&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any or all of the functions&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;receiving&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;replacing&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;receiving agency&rdquo; to avoid confusion with subsection (b).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b), the word &ldquo;first&rdquo; in the phrase &ldquo;shall first be transferred&rdquo; is omitted as redundant in view of the subsequent limitation imposed by the words following &ldquo;before&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;make an appointment from another source to that position&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;appoint additional employees from any other source for such position&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
