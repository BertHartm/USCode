<p class="note-body">Only that portion of the source law which is applicable to civilian officers and employees and their dependents is codified in this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1), the word &ldquo;agency&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;department&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;including such term when used in the amendment made by section 16&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage. The words &ldquo;an Executive agency and a military department&rdquo; are coextensive with and substituted for &ldquo;any executive department, independent establishment, or agency (including corporations) in the executive branch of the Federal Government&rdquo; in view of the definitions in sections 105 and 102, and on authority of 5 U.S.C. 933a which provides that general legislation governing employment, compensation, and the status of employees of the United States applies to employees of the General Accounting Office in the same manner as if they were in the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (3)(A), the word &ldquo;lawful&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary in view of the accepted recognition of the fact that the word &ldquo;wife&rdquo; means a lawful wife. In paragraph (3)(E), the words &ldquo;head of the agency concerned or his designee&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;head of the department concerned, or subordinate designated by him&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definitions in paragraphs (5) and (6), which do not appear in, but are based on, the source law are created for legislative convenience.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
