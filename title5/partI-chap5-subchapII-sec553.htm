<p class="statutory-body">(a) This section applies, according to the provisions thereof, except to the extent that there is involved&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a military or foreign affairs function of the United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a matter relating to agency management or personnel or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) General notice of proposed rule making shall be published in the Federal Register, unless persons subject thereto are named and either personally served or otherwise have actual notice thereof in accordance with law. The notice shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a statement of the time, place, and nature of public rule making proceedings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) reference to the legal authority under which the rule is proposed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) either the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of the subjects and issues involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except when notice or hearing is required by statute, this subsection does not apply&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to interpretative rules, general statements of policy, or rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice; or</p>
