<p class="statutory-body">(a) If there is permanent disability involving the loss, or loss of use, of a member or function of the body or involving disfigurement, the employee is entitled to basic compensation for the disability, as provided by the schedule in subsection (c) of this section, at the rate of 662/3 percent of his monthly pay.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in addition to compensation for temporary total or temporary partial disability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) With respect to any period after payments under subsection (a) of this section have ended, an employee is entitled to compensation as provided by&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 8106 of this title if the disability is partial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The compensation schedule is as follows:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Loss of hearing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) complete loss of hearing of one ear, 52 weeks&rsquo; compensation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) complete loss of hearing of both ears, 200 weeks&rsquo; compensation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Compensation for loss of binocular vision or for loss of 80 percent or more of the vision of an eye is the same as for loss of the eye.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) Compensation for loss of more than one phalanx of a digit is the same as for loss of the entire digit. Compensation for loss of the first phalanx is one-half of the compensation for loss of the entire digit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) If, in the case of an arm or a leg, the member is amputated above the wrist or ankle, compensation is the same as for loss of the arm or leg, respectively.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Compensation for loss of use of two or more digits, or one or more phalanges of each of two or more digits, of a hand or foot, is proportioned to the loss of use of the hand or foot occasioned thereby.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) Compensation for permanent partial loss of use of a member may be for proportionate loss of use of the member. The degree of loss of vision or hearing under this schedule is determined without regard to correction.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20) In case of loss of use of more than one member or parts of more than one member as enumerated by this schedule, the compensation is for loss of use of each member or part thereof, and the awards run consecutively. However, when the injury affects only two or more digits of the same hand or foot, paragraph (17) of this subsection applies, and when partial bilateral loss of hearing is involved, compensation is computed on the loss as affecting both ears.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) For serious disfigurement of the face, head, or neck of a character likely to handicap an individual in securing or maintaining employment, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed $3,500 shall be awarded in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(22) For permanent loss or loss of use of any other important external or internal organ of the body as determined by the Secretary, proper and equitable compensation not to exceed 312 weeks&rsquo; compensation for each organ so determined shall be paid in addition to any other compensation payable under this schedule.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) While an employee is receiving compensation under this subchapter, or if he has been paid a lump sum in commutation of installment payments until the expiration of the period during which the installment payments would have continued, he may not receive salary, pay, or remuneration of any type from the United States, except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in return for service actually performed;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) pension for service in the Army, Navy, or Air Force;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) other benefits administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs unless such benefits are payable for the same injury or the same death; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) retired pay, retirement pay, retainer pay, or equivalent pay for service in the Armed Forces or other uniformed services, subject to the reduction of such pay in accordance with section 5532(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8116_1_target" name="8116_1">1</a></sup> of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title, or another retirement system for employees of the Government, does not impair the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An individual entitled to benefits under this subchapter because of his injury, or because <!-- PDFPage:652 -->of the death of an employee, who also is entitled to receive from the United States under a provision of statute other than this subchapter payments or benefits for that injury or death (except proceeds of an insurance policy), because of service by him (or in the case of death, by the deceased) as an employee or in the armed forces, shall elect which benefits he will receive. The individual shall make the election within 1 year after the injury or death or within a further time allowed for good cause by the Secretary of Labor. The election when made is irrevocable, except as otherwise provided by statute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The liability of the United States or an instrumentality thereof under this subchapter or any extension thereof with respect to the injury or death of an employee is exclusive and instead of all other liability of the United States or the instrumentality to the employee, his legal representative, spouse, dependents, next of kin, and any other person otherwise entitled to recover damages from the United States or the instrumentality because of the injury or death in a direct judicial proceeding, in a civil action, or in admiralty, or by an administrative or judicial proceeding under a workmen's compensation statute or under a Federal tort liability statute. However, this subsection does not apply to a master or a member of a crew of a vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section, an individual receiving benefits for disability or death under this subchapter who is also receiving benefits under subchapter III of chapter 84 of this title or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act shall be entitled to all such benefits, except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) benefits received under section 223 of the Social Security Act (on account of disability) shall be subject to reduction on account of benefits paid under this subchapter pursuant to the provisions of section 224 of the Social Security Act; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of benefits received on account of age or death under title II of the Social Security Act, compensation payable under this subchapter based on the Federal service of an employee shall be reduced by the amount of any such social security benefits payable that are attributable to Federal service of that employee covered by chapter 84 of this title. However, eligibility for or receipt of benefits under chapter 84 of this title, or benefits under title II of the Social Security Act by virtue of service covered by chapter 84 of this title, does not affect the right of the employee to compensation for scheduled disabilities specified by section 8107(c) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) To the widow or widower, if there is no child, 50 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the widow or widower, if there is a child, 45 percent and in addition 15 percent for each child not to exceed a total of 75 percent for the widow or widower and children.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the children, if there is no widow or widower, 40 percent for one child and 15 percent additional for each additional child not to exceed a total of 75 percent, divided among the children share and share alike.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the parents, if there is no widow, widower, or child, as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 25 percent if one parent was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death and the other was not dependent to any extent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 20 percent to each if both were wholly dependent; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a proportionate amount in the discretion of the Secretary of Labor if one or both were partly dependent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If there is a widow, widower, or child, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, and children, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To the brothers, sisters, grandparents, and grandchildren, if there is no widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) 20 percent if one was wholly dependent on the employee at the time of death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) 30 percent if more than one was wholly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) 10 percent if no one is wholly dependent but one or more is partly dependent, divided among the dependents share and share alike.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">If there is a widow, widower, child, or dependent parent, so much of the percentages are payable as, when added to the total percentages payable to the widow, widower, children, and dependent parents, will not exceed a total of 75 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:660 --><p class="statutory-body">(b) The compensation payable under subsection (a) of this section is paid from the time of death until&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a widow, or widower dies or remarries before reaching age 55;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a child, a brother, a sister, or a grandchild dies, marries, or becomes 18 years of age, or if over age 18 and incapable of self-support becomes capable of self-support; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) a parent or grandparent dies, marries, or ceases to be dependent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Notwithstanding paragraph (2) of this subsection, compensation payable to or for a child, a brother or sister, or grandchild that would otherwise end because the child, brother or sister, or grandchild has reached 18 years of age shall continue if he is a student as defined by section 8101 of this title at the time he reaches 18 years of age for so long as he continues to be such a student or until he marries. A widow or widower who has entitlements to benefits under this title derived from more than one husband or wife shall elect one entitlement to be utilized.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) On the cessation of compensation under this section to or on account of an individual, the compensation of the remaining individuals entitled to compensation for the unexpired part of the period during which their compensation is payable, is that which they would have received if they had been the only individuals entitled to compensation at the time of the death of the employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When there are two or more classes of individuals entitled to compensation under this section and the apportionment of compensation under this section would result in injustice, the Secretary may modify the apportionment to meet the requirements of the case.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In computing compensation under this section, the monthly pay is deemed not less than the minimum rate of basic pay for GS&ndash;2. However, the total monthly compensation may not exceed&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the monthly pay computed under section 8114 of this title, except for increases authorized by section 8146a of this title; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) 75 percent of the monthly pay of the maximum rate of basic pay for GS&ndash;15.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any funeral and burial expenses paid under section 8134, there shall be paid a sum of $200 to the personal representative of a deceased employee within the meaning of section 8101(1) of this title for reimbursement of the costs of termination of the decedent's status as an employee of the United States.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) When the Secretary of Labor finds that the amount of compensation payable to an employee who is neither a citizen nor resident of the United States or Canada, or payable to a dependent of such an employee, is substantially disproportionate to compensation for disability or death payable in similar cases under local statute, regulations, custom, or otherwise at the place outside the continental United States or Canada where the employee is working at the time of injury, he may provide for payment of compensation on a basis reasonably in accord with prevailing local payments in similar cases by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the adoption or adaption of the substantive features, by a schedule or otherwise, of local workmen's compensation provisions or other local statute, regulation, or custom applicable in cases of personal injury or death; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) establishing special schedules of compensation for injury, death, and loss of use of members and functions of the body for specific classes of employees, areas, and places.</p>

<!-- PDFPage:663 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) modify, limit, or redesignate the class or classes of beneficiaries entitled to death benefits, including the designation of persons, representatives, or groups entitled to payment under local statute or custom whether or not included in the classes of beneficiaries otherwise specified by this subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In a case under this section, the Secretary or his designee may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) make a lump-sum award in the manner prescribed by section 8135 of this title when he or his designee considers it to be for the best interest of the United States; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">Compensation paid under this subsection is instead of all other compensation from the United States for the same injury or death, and a payment made under this subsection is deemed compensation under this subchapter and is satisfaction of all liability of the United States in respect to the particular injury or death.</p>

Each agency and instrumentality shall include in its annual budget estimates for the fiscal year beginning in the next calendar year a request for an appropriation in an amount equal to the costs. Sums appropriated pursuant to the request shall be deposited in the Treasury to the credit of the Fund within 30 days after they are available. An agency or instrumentality not dependent on an annual appropriation shall make the deposit required by this subsection from <!-- PDFPage:671 -->funds under its control during the first fifteen days of October following the furnishing of the statement. If an agency or instrumentality (or part or function thereof) is transferred to another agency or instrumentality, the cost of compensation benefits and other expenses paid from the Fund on account of the injury or death of employees of the transferred agency or instrumentality (or part or function) shall be included in costs of the receiving agency or instrumentality.</p>
