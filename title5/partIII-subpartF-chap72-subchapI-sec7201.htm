<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) &ldquo;underrepresentation&rdquo; means a situation in which the number of members of a minority group designation (determined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in consultation with the Office of Personnel Management, on the basis of the policy set forth in subsection (b) of this section) within a category of civil service employment constitutes a lower percentage of the total number of employees within the employment category than the percentage that the minority constituted within the labor force of the United States, as determined under the most recent decennial or mid-decade census, or current population survey, under title 13, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;category of civil service employment&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that each Executive agency conduct a continuing program for the recruitment of members of minorities for positions in the agency to carry out the policy set forth in subsection (b) in a manner designed to eliminate underrepresentation of minorities in the various categories of civil service employment within the Federal service, with special efforts directed at recruiting in minority communities, in educational institutions, and from other sources from which minorities can be recruited; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the Office conduct a continuing program of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assistance to agencies in carrying out programs under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) make determinations of underrepresentation which are proposed to be used initially under such program; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) transmit to the Executive agencies involved, to the Office of Personnel Management, and to the Congress the determinations made under paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
