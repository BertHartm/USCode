<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;Congressional employee&rdquo; in section 2107 of this title includes an Official Reporter of Debates of the Senate and an individual employed by an Official Reporter of Debates of the Senate so that the inclusion of &ldquo;a Congressional employee&rdquo; in subsection (a)(3) provides the coverage for those individuals which was given by former section 126 of title 2.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in section 2105 of this title is broad enough to cover the officers and employees set out in former section 2091(a) with the exception of Members of Congress, the President, individuals employed either by the government of the District of Columbia or by Gallaudet College, and United States commissioners. Accordingly, these have been added specifically in paragraphs (2), (4), (5), (6), and (7).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a) (B), the words &ldquo;United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;a State of the United States or the District of Columbia&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(C) is added for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the last sentence is added on authority of former section 2351, which section is scheduled for transfer to section 901 of title 20.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
