<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Office of Personnel Management may contract with qualified carriers offering plans described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title, without regard to section 5 of title 41 or other statute requiring competitive bidding. Each contract shall be for a uniform term of at least 1 year, but may be made automatically renewable from term to term in the absence of notice of termination by either party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) To be eligible as a carrier for the plan described by section 8903(2) of this title, a company must be licensed to issue group health insurance in all the States and the District of Columbia.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A contract for a plan described by section 8903(1) or (2) of this title shall require the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to reinsure with other companies which elect to participate, under an equitable formula based on the total amount of their group health insurance benefit payments in the United States during the latest year for which the information is available, to be determined by the carrier and approved by the Office; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to allocate its rights and obligations under the contract among its affiliates which elect to participate, under an equitable formula to be determined by the carrier and the affiliates and approved by the Office.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Each contract under this chapter shall contain a detailed statement of benefits offered and shall include such maximums, limitations, exclusions, and other definitions of benefits as the Office considers necessary or desirable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The Office may prescribe reasonable minimum standards for health benefits plans described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title and for carriers offering the plans. Approval of a plan may be withdrawn only after notice and opportunity for hearing to the carrier concerned without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of this title. The Office may terminate the contract of a carrier effective at the end of the contract term, if the Office finds that at no time during the preceding two contract terms did the carrier have 300 or more employees and annuitants, exclusive of family members, enrolled in the plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) A contract may not be made or a plan approved which excludes an individual because of race, sex, health status, or, at the time of the first opportunity to enroll, because of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) A contract may not be made or a plan approved which does not offer to each employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title whose enrollment in the plan is ended, except by a cancellation of enrollment, a temporary extension of coverage during which he may exercise the option to convert, without evidence of good health, to a nongroup contract providing health benefits. An employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title who exercises this option shall pay the full periodic charges of the nongroup contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The benefits and coverage made available under subsection (g) of this section are noncancelable by the carrier except for fraud, over-insurance, or nonpayment of periodic charges.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) Rates charged under health benefits plans described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title shall reasonably and equitably reflect the cost of the benefits provided. Rates under health benefits plans described by section 8903(1) and (2) of this title shall be determined on a basis which, in the judgment of the Office, is consistent with the lowest schedule of basic rates generally charged for new group health benefit plans issued to large employers. The rates determined for the first contract term shall be continued for later contract terms, except that they may be readjusted for any later term, based on past experience and benefit adjustments under the later contract. Any readjustment in rates shall be made in advance of the contract term in which they will apply and on a basis which, in the judgment of the Office, is consistent with the general practice of carriers which issue group health benefit plans to large employers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) Each contract under this chapter shall require the carrier to agree to pay for or provide a health service or supply in an individual case if the Office finds that the employee, annuitant, <!-- PDFPage:946 -->family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title is entitled thereto under the terms of the contract.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) When a contract under this chapter requires payment or reimbursement for services which may be performed by a clinical psychologist, optometrist, nurse midwife, nursing school administered clinic, or nurse practitioner/clinical specialist, licensed or certified as such under Federal or State law, as applicable, or by a qualified clinical social worker as defined in section 8901(11), an employee, annuitant, family member, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title covered by the contract shall be free to select, and shall have direct access to, such a clinical psychologist, qualified clinical social worker, optometrist, nurse midwife, nursing school administered clinic, or nurse practitioner/nurse clinical specialist without supervision or referral by another health practitioner and shall be entitled under the contract to have payment or reimbursement made to him or on his behalf for the services performed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Nothing in this subsection shall be considered to preclude a health benefits plan from providing direct access or direct payment or reimbursement to a provider in a health care practice or profession other than a practice or profession listed in paragraph (1), if such provider is licensed or certified as such under Federal or State law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to comprehensive medical plans as described in section 8903(4) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) The Office shall contract under this chapter for a plan described in section 8903(4) of this title with any qualified health maintenance carrier which offers such a plan. For the purpose of this subsection, &ldquo;qualified health maintenance carrier&rdquo; means any qualified carrier which is a qualified health maintenance organization within the meaning of section 1310(d)(1)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8902_1_target" name="8902_1">1</a></sup> of title XIII of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 300c&ndash;9(d)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m)(1) The terms of any contract under this chapter which relate to the nature, provision, or extent of coverage or benefits (including payments with respect to benefits) shall supersede and preempt any State or local law, or any regulation issued thereunder, which relates to health insurance or plans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, if a contract under this chapter provides for the provision of, the payment for, or the reimbursement of the cost of health services for the care and treatment of any particular health condition, the carrier shall provide, pay, or reimburse up to the limits of its contract for any such health service properly provided by any person licensed under State law to provide such service if such service is provided to an individual covered by such contract in a State where 25 percent or more of the population is located in primary medical care manpower shortage areas designated pursuant to section 332 of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 254e).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The provisions of subparagraph (A) shall not apply to contracts entered into providing prepayment plans described in section 8903(4) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(n) A contract for a plan described by section 8903(1), (2), or (3), or section 8903a, shall require the carrier&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to implement hospitalization-cost-containment measures, such as measures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) for verifying the medical necessity of any proposed treatment or surgery;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for determining the feasibility or appropriateness of providing services on an outpatient rather than on an inpatient basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) for determining the appropriate length of stay (through concurrent review or otherwise) in cases involving inpatient care; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) involving case management, if the circumstances so warrant; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to establish incentives to encourage compliance with measures under paragraph (1).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>o</em>) A contract may not be made or a plan approved which includes coverage for any benefit, item, or service for which funds may not be used under the Assisted Suicide Funding Restriction Act of 1997.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) In making a determination relating to the appropriateness of imposing or the period of any debarment under this section (where such debarment is not mandatory), or the appropriateness of imposing or the amount of any civil penalty or assessment under this section, the Office shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the nature of any claims involved and the circumstances under which they were presented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses or improper conduct of the provider involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), debarment of a provider under subsection (b) or (c) shall be effective at such time and upon such reasonable notice to such provider, and to carriers and covered individuals, as shall be specified in regulations prescribed by the Office. Any such provider that is debarred from participation may request a hearing in accordance with subsection (h)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Unless the Office determines that the health or safety of individuals receiving health care services warrants an earlier effective date, the Office shall not make a determination adverse to a provider under subsection (c)(5) or (d) until such provider has been given reasonable notice and an opportunity for the determination to be made after a hearing as provided in accordance with subsection (h)(1).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a debarment shall be effective with respect to any health care services or supplies furnished by a provider on or after the effective date of such provider's debarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A debarment shall not apply with respect to inpatient institutional services furnished to an individual who was admitted to the institution before the date the debarment would otherwise become effective until the passage of 30 days after such date, unless the Office determines that the health or safety of the individual receiving those services warrants that a shorter period, or that no such period, be afforded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any notice of debarment referred to in paragraph (1) shall specify the date as of which debarment becomes effective and the minimum period of time for which such debarment is to remain effective. In the case of a debarment under paragraph (1), (2), (3), or (4) of subsection (b), the minimum period of debarment shall not be less than 3 years, except as provided in paragraph (4)(B)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A provider barred from participating in the program under this chapter may, after the expiration of the minimum period of debarment referred to in paragraph (3), apply to the Office, in such manner as the Office may by regulation prescribe, for termination of the debarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Office may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant to an application filed by such provider after the end of the minimum debarment period, if the Office determines, based on the conduct of the applicant, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) there is no basis under subsection (b), (c), or (d) for continuing the debarment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) there are reasonable assurances that the types of actions which formed the basis for the original debarment have not recurred and will not recur; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notwithstanding any provision of subparagraph (A), terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant to an application filed by such provider before the end of the minimum debarment period, if the Office determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) based on the conduct of the applicant, the requirements of subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) have been met; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) early termination under this clause is warranted based on the fact that the provider is the sole community provider or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community, or other similar circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Office shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promptly notify the appropriate State or local agency or authority having responsibility for the licensing or certification of a provider barred from participation in the program under this chapter of the fact of the debarment, as well as the reasons for such debarment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) request that appropriate investigations be made and sanctions invoked in accordance with applicable law and policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) request that the State or local agency or authority keep the Office fully and currently informed with respect to any actions taken in response to the request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Any provider of health care services or supplies that is the subject of an adverse determination by the Office under this section shall be entitled to reasonable notice and an opportunity to request a hearing of record, and to judicial review as provided in this subsection after the Office renders a final decision. The Office shall grant a request for a hearing upon a showing that due process rights have not previously been afforded with respect to any finding of fact which is relied upon as a cause for an adverse determination under this section. Such hearing shall be conducted without regard to subchapter II of chapter 5 and chapter 7 of this title by a hearing officer who shall be designated by the Director of the Office and who shall not otherwise have been involved in the adverse determination being appealed. A request for a hearing under this subsection shall be filed within such period and in accordance with such procedures as the Office shall prescribe by regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any provider adversely affected by a final decision under paragraph (1) made after a hear<!-- PDFPage:951 -->ing to which such provider was a party may seek review of such decision in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or for the district in which the plaintiff resides or has his or her principal place of business by filing a notice of appeal in such court within 60 days after the date the decision is issued, and by simultaneously sending copies of such notice by certified mail to the Director of the Office and to the Attorney General. In answer to the appeal, the Director of the Office shall promptly file in such court a certified copy of the transcript of the record, if the Office conducted a hearing, and other evidence upon which the findings and decision complained of are based. The court shall have power to enter, upon the pleadings and evidence of record, a judgment affirming, modifying, or setting aside, in whole or in part, the decision of the Office, with or without remanding the case for a rehearing. The district court shall not set aside or remand the decision of the Office unless there is not substantial evidence on the record, taken as whole, to support the findings by the Office of a cause for action under this section or unless action taken by the Office constitutes an abuse of discretion.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Matters that were raised or that could have been raised in a hearing under paragraph (1) or an appeal under paragraph (2) may not be raised as a defense to a civil action by the United States to collect a penalty or assessment imposed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) A civil action to recover civil monetary penalties or assessments under subsection (d) shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the United States, and may be brought in the United States district court for the district where the claim involved was presented or where the person subject to the penalty resides. Amounts recovered under this section shall be paid to the Office for deposit into the Employees Health Benefits Fund. The amount of a penalty or assessment as finally determined by the Office, or other amount the Office may agree to in compromise, may be deducted from any sum then or later owing by the United States to the party against whom the penalty or assessment has been levied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which, with respect to services or supplies furnished by a debarred provider to a covered individual during the period of such provider's debarment, payment or reimbursement under this chapter may be made, notwithstanding the fact of such debarment, if such individual did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known of the debarment. In any such instance, the carrier involved shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the individual is informed of the debarment and the minimum period of time remaining under the terms of the debarment.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Not later than October 1 of each year, the Office of Personnel Management shall determine the weighted average of the subscription charges that will be in effect during the following contract year with respect to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) enrollments under this chapter for self alone; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) enrollments under this chapter for self and family.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In determining each weighted average under paragraph (1), the weight to be given to a particular subscription charge shall, with respect to each plan (and option) to which it is to apply, be commensurate with the number of enrollees enrolled in such plan (and option) as of March 31 of the year in which the determination is being made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of paragraph (2), the term &ldquo;enrollee&rdquo; means any individual who, during the contract year for which the weighted average is to be used under this section, will be eligible for a Government contribution for health benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2), (3), and (4), the biweekly Government contribution for health benefits for an employee or annuitant enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter is adjusted to an amount equal to 72 percent of the weighted average under subsection (a)(1)(A) or (B), as applicable. For an employee, the adjustment begins on the first day of the employee's first pay period of each year. For an annuitant, the adjustment begins on the first day of the first period of each year for which an annuity payment is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The biweekly Government contribution for an employee or annuitant enrolled in a plan under this chapter shall not exceed 75 percent of the subscription charge.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In the case of an employee who is occupying a position on a part-time career employment basis (as defined in section 3401(2) of this title), the biweekly Government contribution shall be equal to the percentage which bears the same ratio to the percentage determined under this subsection (without regard to this paragraph) as the average number of hours of such employee's regularly scheduled workweek bears to the average number of hours in the regularly scheduled workweek of an employee serving in a comparable position on a full-time career basis (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Office).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In the case of persons who are enrolled in a health benefits plan as part of the demonstration project under section 1108 of title 10, the Government contribution shall be subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (i) of that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) There shall be withheld from the pay of each enrolled employee and (except as provided in subsection (i) of this section) the annuity of each enrolled annuitant and there shall be contributed by the Government, amounts, in the same ratio as the contributions of the employee or annuitant and the Government under subsection (b) of this section, which are necessary for the administrative costs and the reserves provided for by section 8909(b) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The amount necessary to pay the total charge for enrollment, after the Government contribution is deducted, shall be withheld from the pay of each enrolled employee and (except as provided in subsection (i) of this section) from the annuity of each enrolled annuitant. The withholding for an annuitant shall be the same as that for an employee enrolled in the same health benefits plan and level of benefits.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1)(A) An employee enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter who is placed in a leave without pay status may have his coverage and the coverage of members of his family continued under the plan for not to exceed 1 year under regulations prescribed by the Office.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) employee and Government contributions required by this section shall be paid on a current basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) if necessary, the head of the employing agency shall approve advance payment, recoverable in the same manner as under section 5524a(c), of a portion of basic pay sufficient to pay current employee contributions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Each agency shall establish procedures for accepting direct payments of employee contributions for the purposes of this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee who enters on approved leave without pay to serve as a full-time officer or employee of an organization composed primarily of employees as defined by section 8901 of this title, within 60 days after entering on that leave without pay, may file with his employing agency an election to continue his health benefits enrollment and arrange to pay currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund, through his employing agency, both employee and agency contributions from the beginning of leave <!-- PDFPage:962 -->without pay. The employing agency shall forward the enrollment charges so paid to the Fund. If the employee does not so elect, his enrollment will continue during nonpay status and end as provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection and implementing regulations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) An employing agency may pay both the employee and Government contributions, and any additional administrative expenses otherwise chargeable to the employee, with respect to health care coverage for an employee described in subparagraph (B) and the family of such employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An employee referred to in subparagraph (A) is an employee who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is enrolled in a health benefits plan under this chapter;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) serves on active duty for a period of more than 30 consecutive days.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding the one-year limitation on coverage described in paragraph (1)(A), payment may be made under this paragraph for a period not to exceed 24 months.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Government contribution, and any additional payments under subsection (e)(3)(A), for health benefits for an employee shall be paid&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in the case of employees generally, from the appropriation or fund which is used to pay the employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in the case of an elected official, from an appropriation or fund available for payment of other salaries of the same office or establishment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in the case of an employee of the legislative branch who is paid by the Chief Administrative Officer of the House of Representatives, from the applicable accounts of the House of Representatives; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) in the case of an employee in a leave without pay status, from the appropriation or fund which would be used to pay the employee if he were in a pay status.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Except as provided in paragraphs (2) and (3), the Government contributions authorized by this section for health benefits for an annuitant shall be paid from annual appropriations which are authorized to be made for that purpose and which may be made available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Government contributions authorized by this section for health benefits for an individual who first becomes an annuitant by reason of retirement from employment with the United States Postal Service on or after July 1, 1971, or for a survivor of such an individual or of an individual who died on or after July 1, 1971, while employed by the United States Postal Service, shall be paid by the United States Postal Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In determining any amount for which the Postal Service is liable under this paragraph, the amount of the liability shall be prorated to reflect only that portion of total service which is attributable to civilian service performed (by the former postal employee or by the deceased individual referred to in subparagraph (A), as the case may be) after June 30, 1971, as estimated by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Government contribution for persons enrolled in a health benefits plan as part of the demonstration project under section 1108 of title 10 shall be paid as provided in subsection (i) of that section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Office shall provide for conversion of biweekly rates of contribution specified by this section to rates for employees and annuitants paid on other than a biweekly basis, and for this purpose may provide for the adjustment of the converted rate to the nearest cent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) An annuitant whose annuity is insufficient to cover the withholdings required for enrollment in a particular health benefits plan may enroll (or remain enrolled) in such plan, notwithstanding any other provision of this section, if the annuitant elects, under conditions prescribed by regulations of the Office, to pay currently into the Employees Health Benefits Fund, through the retirement system that administers the annuitant's health benefits enrollment, an amount equal to the withholdings that would otherwise be required under this section.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8909. Employees Health Benefits Fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) There is in the Treasury of the United States an Employees Health Benefits Fund which is administered by the Office of Personnel Management. The contributions of enrollees and the Government described by section 8906 of this title shall be paid into the Fund. The Fund is available&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) without fiscal year limitation for all payments to approved health benefits plans; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to pay expenses for administering this chapter within the limitations that may be specified annually by Congress.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Payments from the Fund to a plan participating in a letter-of-credit arrangement under this chapter shall, in connection with any payment or reimbursement to be made by such plan for a health service or supply, be made, to the maximum extent practicable, on a checks-presented basis (as defined under regulations of the Department of the Treasury).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Portions of the contributions made by enrollees and the Government shall be regularly set aside in the Fund as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) A percentage, not to exceed 1 percent of all contributions, determined by the Office to be reasonably adequate to pay the administrative expenses made available by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) For each health benefits plan, a percentage, not to exceed 3 percent of the contributions toward the plan, determined by the Office to be reasonably adequate to provide a contingency reserve.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The Office, from time to time and in amounts it considers appropriate, may transfer unused funds for administrative expenses to the contingency reserves of the plans then under contract with the Office. When funds are so transferred, each contingency reserve shall be credited in proportion to the total amount of the subscription charges paid and accrued to the plan for the contract term immediately before the contract term in which the transfer is made. The income derived from dividends, rate adjustments, or other refunds made by a plan shall be credited to its contingency reserve. The contingency reserves may be used to defray increases in future rates, or may be applied to reduce the contributions of enrollees and the Government to, or to increase the benefits provided by, the plan from which the reserves are derived, as the Office from time to time shall determine.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of the Treasury may invest and reinvest any of the money in the Fund in interest-bearing obligations of the United States, and may sell these obligations for the purposes of the Fund. The interest on and the proceeds from the sale of these obligations become a part of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When the assets, liabilities, and membership of employee organizations sponsoring or underwriting plans approved under section 8903(3) or 8903a of this title are merged, the assets (including contingency reserves) and liabilities of the plans sponsored or underwritten by the merged organizations shall be transferred at the beginning of the contract term next following the date of the merger to the plan sponsored or underwritten by the successor organization. Each employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title affected by a merger shall be transferred to the plan sponsored or underwritten by the successor organization unless he enrolls in another plan under this chapter. If the successor organization is an organization described in section 8901(8)(B) of this title, any employee, annuitant, former spouse, or person having continued coverage under section 8905a of this title so transferred may not remain enrolled in the plan after the end of the contract term in which the merger occurs unless that individual is a full member of such organization (as determined under section 8903a(d) of this title).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Except as provided by subsection (d) of this section, when a plan described by section 8903(3) or (4) or 8903a of this title is discontinued under this chapter, the contingency reserve of that plan shall be credited to the contingency reserves of the plans continuing under this chapter for the contract term following that in which termination occurs, each reserve to be credited in proportion to the amount of the subscription charges paid and accrued to the plan for the year of termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any crediting required under paragraph (1) pursuant to the discontinuation of any plan under this chapter shall be completed by the end of the second contract year beginning after such plan is so discontinued.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Office shall prescribe regulations in accordance with which this subsection shall be applied in the case of any plan which is discontinued before being credited with the full amount to which it would otherwise be entitled based on the discontinuation of any other plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) No tax, fee, or other monetary payment may be imposed, directly or indirectly, on a carrier or an underwriting or plan administration subcontractor of an approved health benefits plan by any State, the District of Columbia, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, or by any political subdivision or other governmental authority thereof, with respect to any payment made from the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall not be construed to exempt any carrier or underwriting or plan administration subcontractor of an approved health benefits plan from the imposition, payment, or collection of a tax, fee, or other monetary payment on the net income or profit accruing to or realized by such carrier or underwriting or plan administration subcontractor from business conducted under this chapter, if that tax, fee, or payment is applicable to a broad range of business activity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The fund described in subsection (a) is available to pay costs that the Office incurs for activities associated with implementation of the demonstration project under section 1108 of title 10.</p>
