<p class="statutory-body">(a) Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subchapter or any collective bargaining agreement and subject to subsection (c) of this section, if the head of an agency finds that a particular flexible or compressed schedule under this subchapter has had or would have an adverse agency impact, the agency shall promptly determine not to&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For purposes of this section, &ldquo;adverse agency impact&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a diminished level of services furnished to the public by the agency; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) an increase in the cost of agency operations (other than a reasonable administrative cost relating to the process of establishing a flexible or compressed schedule).</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Panel shall promptly consider any case presented under subparagraph (A), and shall take final action in favor of the agency's determination if the finding on which it is based is supported by evidence that the schedule is likely to cause an adverse agency impact.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) If an agency and an exclusive representative have entered into a collective bargaining agreement providing for use of a flexible or compressed schedule under this subchapter and the head of the agency determines under subsection (a)(2) to terminate a flexible or compressed schedule, the agency may reopen the agreement to seek termination of the schedule involved.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the agreement covering such schedule is renegotiated or expires or terminates pursuant to the terms of that agreement; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the date of the Panel's final decision, if an impasse arose in the reopening of the agreement under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph.</p>
