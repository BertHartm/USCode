<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;individuals employed by&rdquo; and the word &ldquo;individuals&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;civilian employees of&rdquo; and &ldquo;employees&rdquo;, respectively, in view of the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in section 2105 which is limited to those employed by the Government of the United States. The word &ldquo;civilian&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary as military personnel are not &ldquo;employed&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;disbursing officials&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;disbursing officers&rdquo; as the definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 2104 excludes a member of a uniformed service.</p>
