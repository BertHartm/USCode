<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Executive department&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;department&rdquo; as the definition of &ldquo;department&rdquo; applicable to this section is coextensive with the definition of &ldquo;Executive department&rdquo; in section 101.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;or military department&rdquo; are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.</p>
<p class="note-body">The word &ldquo;detail&rdquo; is coextensive with and is substituted for &ldquo;alter the distribution&rdquo;.

The words &ldquo;as he may find it necessary and proper to do&rdquo; and &ldquo;from time to time&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage.</p>
<p class="note-body">This section was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, &sect;201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, &sect;4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171&ndash;1), which provides &ldquo;Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense&rdquo; is omitted from this title but is not repealed.</p>
