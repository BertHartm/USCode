The policy should promote and integrate the effective use of training technologies to create affordable and convenient training opportunities to improve Federal employee performance. The Task Force shall seek the views of experts from industry, academia, and State and local governments as the Task Force proceeds, as appropriate. Specifically, the Task Force shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) develop strategies to improve the efficiency and availability of training opportunities for Federal Government employees;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:280 --><p class="note-body-1em">(2) form partnerships among key Federal agencies, State and local governments, businesses, universities, and other appropriate entities to promote the development and use of high-quality training opportunities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) analyze the use of technology in existing training programs and policies of the Task Force member agencies to determine what changes, modifications, and innovations may be necessary to advance training opportunities;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) in consultation with the Department of Defense and the National Institute of Standards and Technology, recommend standards for training software and associated services purchased by Federal agencies and contractors.

<p class="note-body-1em">(5) evaluate and, where appropriate, coordinate and collaborate on, research and demonstration activities of Task Force member agencies related to Federal training technology;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(6) identify and support cross-agency training areas that would particularly benefit from new instructional technologies and facilitate multiagency procurement and use of training materials, where appropriate;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(7) in consultation with the General Services Administration, the Office of Personnel Management, and the Office of Federal Procurement Policy of the Office of Management and Budget (OFPP), promote existing and new procurement vehicles that allow agencies to provide innovative training opportunities for Federal employees;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(8) recommend changes that may be needed to existing procurement laws to further the objectives of this order and forward the recommendations to the Administrator of OFPP; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) develop options and recommendations for establishing a Federal Individual Training Account for each Federal worker for training relevant to his or her Federal employment. To the extent permitted by law, such accounts may be established with the funds allocated to the agency for employee training. Approval for training would be within the discretion of the individual employee's manager. Options and recommendations shall be reported no later than 6 months from the date of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Duties of All Federal Agencies</em>. (a) Each Federal agency shall, to the extent permitted by law:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) include as part of its annual budget process a set of goals to provide the highest quality and most efficient training opportunities possible to its employees, and a set of performance measures of the quality and availability of training opportunities possible to its employees. Such measures should be, where appropriate, based on outcomes related to performance rather than time allocation;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) identify the resources necessary to achieve the aforementioned goals and performance measures articulated in its annual performance plan;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) and, where practicable, use the standards recommended by the Task Force and published by the Office of Personnel Management for purchasing training software and associated services; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) subject to the availability of appropriations, post training courses, information, and other learning opportunities on the Department of Labor's America's Learning Exchange (ALX), or other appropriate information dissemination vehicles as determined by the Task Force, to make information about Federal training courses, information, and other learning opportunities widely available to Federal employees.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">(2) ensure that qualification standards for civil service positions, where appropriate, reflect standard industry certification practices.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The Department of Labor or other appropriate agency as determined by the Task Force shall, subject to the availability of appropriations:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) establish a specialized database for Federal training within the framework of the Department of Labor's ALX, or other appropriate information dissemination vehicles determined by the Task Force, to make information about Federal training courses, information, and other learning opportunities widely available to Federal employees;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) establish and maintain a training technology website for agencies to post training needs and to foster communication among the agencies and between public and private sector organizations to identify and meet common needs; and</p>
