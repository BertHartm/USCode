<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For the purpose of this chapter, it shall be an unfair labor practice for a labor organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to interfere with, restrain, or coerce any employee in the exercise by the employee of any right under this chapter;</p>
