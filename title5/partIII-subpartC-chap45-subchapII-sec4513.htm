<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The President may pay a cash award in the amount of $20,000 to any employee whose disclosure of fraud, waste, or mismanagement has resulted in substantial cost savings for the Government. In evaluating the significance of a cost savings disclosure made by an employee for purposes of determining whether to make an award to such employee under this section, the President may take into account cost savings projected for subsequent fiscal years which will be attributable to the disclosure. During any fiscal year, the President may not make more than 50 awards under this section.</p>
