<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(G), the words &ldquo;or naval&rdquo; are omitted as included in &ldquo;military&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b)(1)(H), the words &ldquo;functions which by law expire on the termination of present hostilities, within any fixed period thereafter, or before July 1, 1947&rdquo; are omitted as executed.

L. 87&ndash;256, 75 Stat. 538, since &sect;111(c) of the Act provides that a reference in other Acts to a provision of law repealed by &sect;111(a) shall be considered to be a reference to the appropriate provisions of Pub. L. 87&ndash;256.</p>
