The word &ldquo;scheduled&rdquo; is omitted since section 603 of the Act of Oct. 11, 1962, Pub. L. 87&ndash;793, 76 Stat. 847, eliminated the necessity of referring to rates as scheduled or longevity. Reference to the &ldquo;Classification Act of 1949, as amended&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">1967 Act</h4>
<p class="note-body">In the codification of 5 U.S.C. 5547, the words &ldquo;premium pay under this subchapter&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;premium compensation provided by this Act&rdquo; appearing in the source statute&mdash;section 603 of the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, as amended (former 5 U.S.C. 943). This amendment of 5 U.S.C. 5547 is made for clarity and precision of reference and in recognition that the source statutes for certain sections of subchapter V of chapter 55 of title 5 include statutes that were not a part of the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1949. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. 5544(a) is based in part on section 23 (2d proviso) of the act of March 28, 1934, as amended by 76 Stat. 360; and 5 U.S.C. 5545(d) is based on section 804 of the Classification Act of 1949, as added by Public Law 89&ndash;512, 80 Stat. 318. Also, 5 U.S.C. 5541(2)(xi) in effect excludes employees subject to 5 U.S.C. 5544 from the operation of 5 U.S.C. 5547.</p>
