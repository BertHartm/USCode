<h3 class="section-head">&sect;9508. General workforce performance management system</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In lieu of a performance appraisal system established under section 4302, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, within 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, establish for the Internal Revenue Service a performance management system that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintains individual accountability by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establishing one or more retention standards for each employee related to the work of the employee and expressed in terms of individual performance, and communicating such retention standards to employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) making periodic determinations of whether each employee meets or does not meet the employee's established retention standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) taking actions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, with respect to any employee whose performance does not meet established retention standards, including denying any increases in basic pay, promotions, and credit for performance under section 3502, and taking one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Reassignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) An action under chapter 43 or chapter 75 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Any other appropriate action to resolve the performance problem; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) except as provided under section 1204 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, strengthens the system's effectiveness by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establishing goals or objectives for individual, group, or organizational performance (or any combination thereof), consistent with the Internal Revenue Service's performance planning procedures, including those established under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, subtitle III of title 40, Revenue Procedure 64&ndash;22 (as in effect on July 30, 1997), and taxpayer service surveys, and communicating such goals or objectives to employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) using such goals and objectives to make performance distinctions among employees or groups of employees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) using performance assessments as a basis for granting employee awards, adjusting an employee's rate of basic pay, and other appropriate personnel actions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(2), the term &ldquo;performance assessment&rdquo; means a determination of whether or not retention standards established under subsection (a)(1)(A) are met, and any additional performance determination made on the basis of performance goals and objectives established under subsection (a)(2)(A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of this title, the term &ldquo;unacceptable performance&rdquo; with respect to an employee of the Internal Revenue Service covered by a performance management system established under this section means performance of the employee which fails to meet a retention standard established under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury may establish an awards program designed to provide incentives for and recognition of organizational, group, and individual achievements by providing for granting awards to employees who, as individuals or members of a group, contribute to meeting the performance goals and objectives established under this chapter by such means as a superior individual or group accomplishment, a documented productivity gain, or sustained superior performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cash award under subchapter I of chapter 45 may be granted to an employee of the Internal Revenue Service without the need for any approval under section 4502(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In applying sections 4303(b)(1)(A) and 7513(b)(1) to employees of the Internal Revenue Service, &ldquo;30 days&rdquo; may be deemed to be &ldquo;15 days&rdquo;.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:991 --><p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the second sentence of section 5335(c), an employee of the Internal Revenue Service shall not have a right to appeal the denial of a periodic step increase under section 5335 to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;broad-banded system&rdquo; means a system for grouping positions for pay, job evaluation, and other purposes that is different from the system established under chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 as a result of combining grades and related ranges of rates of pay in one or more occupational series.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) The Secretary of the Treasury may, subject to criteria to be prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, establish one or more broad-banded systems covering all or any portion of the Internal Revenue Service workforce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) With the approval of the Office of Personnel Management, a broad-banded system established under this section may either include or consist of positions that otherwise would be subject to subchapter IV of chapter 53 or section 5376.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Office of Personnel Management may require the Secretary of the Treasury to submit information relating to broad-banded systems at the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as otherwise provided under this section, employees under a broad-banded system shall continue to be subject to the laws and regulations covering employees under the pay system that otherwise would apply to such employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The criteria to be prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management shall, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that the structure of any broad-banded system maintains the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish the minimum and maximum number of grades that may be combined into pay bands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) establish requirements for setting minimum and maximum rates of pay in a pay band;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) With the approval of the Office of Personnel Management and in accordance with a plan for implementation submitted by the Secretary of the Treasury, the Secretary may, with respect to Internal Revenue Service employees who are covered by a broad-banded system established under this section, provide for variations from the provisions of subchapter VI of chapter 53.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as otherwise provided by this section, an employee of the Internal Revenue Service may be selected for a permanent appointment in the competitive service in the Internal Revenue Service through internal competitive promotion procedures if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employee has completed, in the competitive service, 2 years of current continuous service under a term appointment or any combination of term appointments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such term appointment or appointments were made under competitive procedures prescribed for permanent appointments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the employee's performance under such term appointment or appointments met established retention standards, or, if not covered by a performance management system established under section 9508, was rated at the fully successful level or higher (or equivalent thereof); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the vacancy announcement for the term appointment from which the conversion is made stated that there was a potential for subsequent conversion to a permanent appointment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An appointment under this section may be made only to a position in the same line of work as a position to which the employee received a term appointment under competitive procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding subchapter I of chapter 33, the Secretary of the Treasury may establish <!-- PDFPage:992 -->category rating systems for evaluating applicants for Internal Revenue Service positions in the competitive service under which qualified candidates are divided into two or more quality categories on the basis of relative degrees of merit, rather than assigned individual numerical ratings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each applicant who meets the minimum qualification requirements for the position to be filled shall be assigned to an appropriate category based on an evaluation of the applicant's knowledge, skills, and abilities relative to those needed for successful performance in the position to be filled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within each quality category established under paragraph (1), preference eligibles shall be listed ahead of individuals who are not preference eligibles. For other than scientific and professional positions at or higher than GS&ndash;9 (or equivalent), preference eligibles who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, and who meet the minimum qualification standards, shall be listed in the highest quality category.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An appointing authority may select any applicant from the highest quality category or, if fewer than three candidates have been assigned to the highest quality category, from a merged category consisting of the highest and second highest quality categories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (4), the appointing authority may not pass over a preference eligible in the same or higher category from which selection is made unless the requirements of section 3317(b) or 3318(b), as applicable, are satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of the Treasury may detail employees among the offices of the Internal Revenue Service without regard to the 120-day limitation in section 3341(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury may establish a probationary period under section 3321 of up to 3 years for Internal Revenue Service positions if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the nature of the work is such that a shorter period is insufficient to demonstrate complete proficiency in the position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary of the Treasury from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any employment priority established under direction of the President for the placement of surplus or displaced employees; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any obligation under a court order or decree relating to the employment practices of the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of the Treasury.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations Relating to Pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Nothing in this section shall constitute authority to modify the pay of any employee who serves in an Executive Schedule position under subchapter II of chapter 53.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) To the maximum extent practicable, for fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the overall amount allocated for compensation of the civilian employees of an organizational or functional unit of the Department of Defense that is included in the National Security Personnel System shall not be less than the amount that would have been allocated for compensation of such employees for such fiscal year if they had not been converted to the National Security Personnel System, based on, at a minimum&mdash;</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:996 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) To the maximum extent practicable, the regulations implementing the National Security Personnel System shall provide a formula for calculating the overall amount to be allocated for fiscal years after fiscal year 2008 for compensation of the civilian employees of an organization or functional unit of the Department of Defense that is included in the National Security Personnel System. The formula shall ensure that in the aggregate, employees are not disadvantaged in terms of the overall amount of pay available as a result of conversion to the National Security Personnel System, while providing flexibility to accommodate changes in the function of the organization, changes in the mix of employees performing those functions, and other changed circumstances that might impact pay levels.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Provisions To Ensure Collaboration With Employee Representatives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In order to ensure that the authority of this section is exercised in collaboration with, and in a manner that ensures the participation of, employee representatives in the planning, development, and implementation of the National Security Personnel System, the Secretary and the Director shall provide for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The Secretary and the Director shall, with respect to any proposed system&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) provide to the employee representatives representing any employees who might be affected a written description of the proposed system or adjustment (including the reasons why it is considered necessary);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) give such representatives at least 30 calendar days (unless extraordinary circumstances require earlier action) to review and make recommendations with respect to the proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) give any recommendations received from such representatives under clause (ii) full and fair consideration in deciding whether or how to proceed with the proposal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Following receipt of recommendations, if any, from such employee representatives with respect to a proposal described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary and the Director shall accept such modifications to the proposal in response to the recommendations as they determine advisable and shall, with respect to any parts of the proposal as to which they have not accepted the recommendations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) notify Congress of those parts of the proposal, together with the recommendations of the employee representatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) meet and confer for not less than 30 calendar days with the employee representatives, in order to attempt to reach agreement on whether or how to proceed with those parts of the proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) at the Secretary's option, or if requested by a majority of the employee representatives participating, use the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service during such meet and confer period to facilitate the process of attempting to reach agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) Any part of the proposal as to which the representatives do not make a recommendation, or as to which the recommendations are accepted by the Secretary and the Director, may be implemented immediately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) With respect to any parts of the proposal as to which recommendations have been made but not accepted by the Secretary and the Director, at any time after 30 calendar days have elapsed since the initiation of the congressional notification, consultation, and mediation procedures set forth in subparagraph (B), if the Secretary, in his discretion, determines that further consultation and mediation is unlikely to produce agreement, the Secretary may implement any or all of such parts (including any modifications made in response to the recommendations as the Secretary determines advisable), but only after 30 days have elapsed after notifying Congress of the decision to implement the part or parts involved (as so modified, if applicable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The Secretary shall notify Congress promptly of the implementation of any part of the proposal and shall furnish with such notice an explanation of the proposal, any changes made to the proposal as a result of recommendations from the employee representatives, and of the reasons why implementation is appropriate under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If a proposal described in subparagraph (A) is implemented, the Secretary and the Director shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) develop a method for the employee representatives to participate in any further planning or development which might become necessary; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary may, at the Secretary's discretion, engage in any and all collaboration activities described in this subsection at an organizational level above the level of exclusive recognition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In the case of any employees who are not within a unit with respect to which a labor organization is accorded exclusive recognition, the Secretary and the Director may develop procedures for representation by any appropriate organization which represents a substantial percentage of those employees or, if none, in such other manner as may be appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The procedures under this subsection are the exclusive procedures for the participation of employee representatives in the planning, development, implementation, or adjustment of the National Security Personnel System.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For any bargaining unit so included under paragraph (1), the Secretary may bargain with a labor organization at an organizational level above the level of exclusive recognition. The decision to bargain at a level above the level of ex<!-- PDFPage:997 -->clusive recognition shall not be subject to review or to statutory third-party dispute resolution procedures outside the Department of Defense. Any such bargaining shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be binding on all subordinate bargaining units of the labor organization at the level of recognition and their exclusive representatives, and the Department of Defense and its subcomponents, without regard to levels of recognition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) supersede all other collective bargaining agreements of the labor organization, including collective bargaining agreements negotiated with an exclusive representative at the level of recognition, except as otherwise determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not be subject to further negotiations with the labor organizations for any purpose, including bargaining at the level of recognition, except as provided for by the Secretary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) be subject to review by an independent third party only to the extent provided and pursuant to procedures established under paragraph (6) of subsection (m).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The National Guard Bureau and the Army and Air Force National Guard are excluded from coverage under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any bargaining completed pursuant to this subsection with a labor organization not otherwise having national consultation rights with the Department of Defense or its subcomponents shall not create any obligation on the Department of Defense or its subcomponents to confer national consultation rights on such a labor organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Provisions Relating to Appellate Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may establish an appeals process that provides employees of the Department of Defense organizational and functional units that are included in the National Security Personnel System fair treatment in any appeals that they bring in decisions relating to their employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall in prescribing regulations for any such appeals process&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) ensure that employees in the National Security Personnel System are afforded the protections of due process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) toward that end, be required to consult with the Merit Systems Protection Board before issuing any such regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Regulations implementing the appeals process may establish legal standards and procedures for personnel actions, including standards for applicable relief, to be taken on the basis of employee misconduct or performance that fails to meet expectations. Such standards shall be consistent with the public employment principles of merit and fitness set forth in section 2301.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Legal standards and precedents applied before the effective date of this section by the Merit Systems Protection Board and the courts under chapters 43, 75, and 77 of this title shall apply to employees of organizational and functional units included in the National Security Personnel System, unless such standards and precedents are inconsistent with legal standards established under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An employee who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is removed, suspended for more than 14 days, furloughed for 30 days or less, reduced in pay, or reduced in pay band (or comparable reduction) by a final decision under the appeals process established under paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not serving under probationary period as defined under regulations established under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) would otherwise be eligible to appeal a performance-based or adverse action under chapter 43 or 75, as applicable, to the Merit Systems Protection Board,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall have the right to petition the full Merit Systems Protection Board for review of the record of that decision pursuant to regulations established under paragraph (2). The Board may dismiss any petition that, in the view of the Board, does not raise substantial questions of fact or law. No personnel action shall be stayed and no interim relief shall be granted during the pendency of the Board's review unless specifically ordered by the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Board may order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate only if the Board determines that the decision was&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) An employee who is adversely affected by a final order or decision of the Board may obtain judicial review of the order or decision as provided in section 7703. The Secretary of Defense, after notifying the Director, may obtain judicial review of any final order or decision of the Board under the same terms and conditions as provided an employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the waiver of any provision of law, including an appeals provision providing a right or remedy under section 2302(b) (1), (8) or (9), that is not otherwise waivable under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The right of an employee to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board of the Department's final decision on an action covered by paragraph (4) of this subsection, and the right of the Merit Systems Protection Board to review such action or to order corrective action pursuant to paragraph (5), is provisional for 7 years after the date of the enactment of this chapter, and shall become permanent unless Congress acts to revise such provisions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Provisions Related to Separation and Retirement Incentives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may establish a program within the Department of Defense under which employees may be eligible for early retirement, offered separation incentive pay to separate from service voluntarily, or both. This authority may be used to reduce the number of personnel employed by the Department of Defense or to restructure the workforce to meet mission objectives without reducing the overall number of personnel. This authority is in addition to, and notwithstanding, any other authorities established by law or regulation for such programs.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:998 --><p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may not authorize the payment of voluntary separation incentive pay under paragraph (1) to more than 25,000 employees in any fiscal year, except that employees who receive voluntary separation incentive pay as a result of a closure or realignment of a military installation under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (title XXIX of Public Law 101&ndash;510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) shall not be included in that number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall prepare a report each fiscal year setting forth the number of employees who received such pay as a result of a closure or realignment of a military base as described under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall submit the report under subparagraph (B) to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; means an employee of the Department of Defense, serving under an appointment without time limitation, except that such term does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a reemployed annuitant under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84, or another retirement system for employees of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an employee having a disability on the basis of which such employee is or would be eligible for disability retirement under any of the retirement systems referred to in subparagraph (A); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for purposes of eligibility for separation incentives under this section, an employee who is in receipt of a decision notice of involuntary separation for misconduct or unacceptable performance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
