<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) In lieu of a performance appraisal system established under section 4302, the Secretary of the Treasury shall, within 1 year after the date of enactment of this section, establish for the Internal Revenue Service a performance management system that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) maintains individual accountability by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establishing one or more retention standards for each employee related to the work of the employee and expressed in terms of individual performance, and communicating such retention standards to employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) making periodic determinations of whether each employee meets or does not meet the employee's established retention standards; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) taking actions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, with respect to any employee whose performance does not meet established retention standards, including denying any increases in basic pay, promotions, and credit for performance under section 3502, and taking one or more of the following actions:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) Reassignment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) An action under chapter 43 or chapter 75 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) Any other appropriate action to resolve the performance problem; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) except as provided under section 1204 of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, strengthens the system's effectiveness by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) establishing goals or objectives for individual, group, or organizational performance (or any combination thereof), consistent with the Internal Revenue Service's performance planning procedures, including those established under the Government Performance and Results Act of 1993, subtitle III of title 40, Revenue Procedure 64&ndash;22 (as in effect on July 30, 1997), and taxpayer service surveys, and communicating such goals or objectives to employees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) using such goals and objectives to make performance distinctions among employees or groups of employees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) using performance assessments as a basis for granting employee awards, adjusting an employee's rate of basic pay, and other appropriate personnel actions, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) For purposes of subsection (a)(2), the term &ldquo;performance assessment&rdquo; means a determination of whether or not retention standards established under subsection (a)(1)(A) are met, and any additional performance determination made on the basis of performance goals and objectives established under subsection (a)(2)(A).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The Secretary of the Treasury may establish an awards program designed to provide incentives for and recognition of organizational, group, and individual achievements by providing for granting awards to employees who, as individuals or members of a group, contribute to meeting the performance goals and objectives established under this chapter by such means as a superior individual or group accomplishment, a documented productivity gain, or sustained superior performance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A cash award under subchapter I of chapter 45 may be granted to an employee of the Internal Revenue Service without the need for any approval under section 4502(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) In applying sections 4303(b)(1)(A) and 7513(b)(1) to employees of the Internal Revenue Service, &ldquo;30 days&rdquo; may be deemed to be &ldquo;15 days&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding the second sentence of section 5335(c), an employee of the Internal Revenue Service shall not have a right to appeal the denial of a periodic step increase under section 5335 to the Merit Systems Protection Board.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) The Secretary of the Treasury may, subject to criteria to be prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, establish one or more broad-banded systems covering all or any portion of the Internal Revenue Service workforce.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) With the approval of the Office of Personnel Management, a broad-banded system established under this section may either include or consist of positions that otherwise would be subject to subchapter IV of chapter 53 or section 5376.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except as otherwise provided under this section, employees under a broad-banded system shall continue to be subject to the laws and regulations covering employees under the pay system that otherwise would apply to such employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The criteria to be prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management shall, at a minimum&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) ensure that the structure of any broad-banded system maintains the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish the minimum and maximum number of grades that may be combined into pay bands;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) establish requirements for setting minimum and maximum rates of pay in a pay band;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Except as otherwise provided by this section, an employee of the Internal Revenue Service may be selected for a permanent appointment in the competitive service in the Internal Revenue Service through internal competitive promotion procedures if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the employee has completed, in the competitive service, 2 years of current continuous service under a term appointment or any combination of term appointments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) such term appointment or appointments were made under competitive procedures prescribed for permanent appointments;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the employee's performance under such term appointment or appointments met established retention standards, or, if not covered by a performance management system established under section 9508, was rated at the fully successful level or higher (or equivalent thereof); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) the vacancy announcement for the term appointment from which the conversion is made stated that there was a potential for subsequent conversion to a permanent appointment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An appointment under this section may be made only to a position in the same line of work as a position to which the employee received a term appointment under competitive procedures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Notwithstanding subchapter I of chapter 33, the Secretary of the Treasury may establish category rating systems for evaluating applicants for Internal Revenue Service positions in the competitive service under which qualified candidates are divided into two or more quality categories on the basis of relative degrees of merit, rather than assigned individual numerical ratings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each applicant who meets the minimum qualification requirements for the position to be filled shall be assigned to an appropriate category based on an evaluation of the applicant's knowledge, skills, and abilities relative to those needed for successful performance in the position to be filled.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Within each quality category established under paragraph (1), preference eligibles shall be <!-- PDFPage:1045 -->listed ahead of individuals who are not preference eligibles. For other than scientific and professional positions at or higher than GS&ndash;9 (or equivalent), preference eligibles who have a compensable service-connected disability of 10 percent or more, and who meet the minimum qualification standards, shall be listed in the highest quality category.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An appointing authority may select any applicant from the highest quality category or, if fewer than three candidates have been assigned to the highest quality category, from a merged category consisting of the highest and second highest quality categories.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) Notwithstanding paragraph (4), the appointing authority may not pass over a preference eligible in the same or higher category from which selection is made unless the requirements of section 3317(b) or 3318(b), as applicable, are satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Secretary of the Treasury may detail employees among the offices of the Internal Revenue Service without regard to the 120-day limitation in section 3341(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Secretary of the Treasury may establish a probationary period under section 3321 of up to 3 years for Internal Revenue Service positions if the Secretary of the Treasury determines that the nature of the work is such that a shorter period is insufficient to demonstrate complete proficiency in the position.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Nothing in this section exempts the Secretary of the Treasury from&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) any employment priority established under direction of the President for the placement of surplus or displaced employees; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any obligation under a court order or decree relating to the employment practices of the Internal Revenue Service or the Department of the Treasury.</p>
