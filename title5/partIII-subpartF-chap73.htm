<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12564, Sept. 15, 1986, 51 F.R. 32889, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, find that:</p>
<p class="note-body">Drug use is having serious adverse effects upon a significant proportion of the national work force and results in billions of dollars of lost productivity each year;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal government, as an employer, is concerned with the well-being of its employees, the successful accomplishment of agency missions, and the need to maintain employee productivity;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal government, as the largest employer in the Nation, can and should show the way towards achieving drug-free workplaces through a program designed to offer drug users a helping hand and, at the same time, demonstrating to drug users and potential drug users that drugs will not be tolerated in the Federal workplace;</p>
<p class="note-body">The profits from illegal drugs provide the single greatest source of income for organized crime, fuel violent street crime, and otherwise contribute to the breakdown of our society;</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees is inconsistent not only with the law-abiding behavior expected of all citizens, but also with the special trust placed in such employees as servants of the public;</p>
<p class="note-body">Federal employees who use illegal drugs, on or off duty, tend to be less productive, less reliable, and prone to greater absenteeism than their fellow employees who do not use illegal drugs;</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees impairs the efficiency of Federal departments and agencies, undermines public confidence in them, and makes it more difficult for other employees who do not use illegal drugs to perform their jobs effectively. The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees also can pose a serious health and safety threat to members of the public and to other Federal employees;</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees in certain positions evidences less than the complete reliability, stability, and good judgment that is consistent with access to sensitive information and creates the possibility of coercion, influence, and irresponsible action under pressure that may pose a serious risk to national security, the public safety, and the effective enforcement of the law; and</p>
<p class="note-body">Federal employees who use illegal drugs must themselves be primarily responsible for changing their behavior and, if necessary, begin the process of rehabilitating themselves.</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including section 3301(2) of Title 5 of the United States Code, section 7301 of Title 5 of the United States Code, section 290ee&ndash;1 of Title 42 of the United States Code, deeming such action in the best interests of national security, public health and safety, law enforcement and the efficiency of the Federal service, and in order to establish standards and procedures to ensure fairness in achieving a drug-free Federal workplace and to protect the privacy of Federal employees, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Drug-Free Workplace</em>. (a) Federal employees are required to refrain from the use of illegal drugs.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Agency Responsibilities</em>. (a) The head of each Executive agency shall develop a plan for achieving the objective of a drug-free workplace with due consideration of the rights of the government, the employee, and the general public.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:634 --><p class="note-body">(b) Each agency plan shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A statement of policy setting forth the agency's expectations regarding drug use and the action to be anticipated in response to identified drug use;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Employee Assistance Programs emphasizing high level direction, education, counseling, referral to rehabilitation, and coordination with available community resources;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressing illegal drug use by agency employees;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent with safety and security issues; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) Provision for identifying illegal drug users, including testing on a controlled and carefully monitored basis in accordance with this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Drug Testing Programs</em>. (a) The head of each Executive agency shall establish a program to test for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions. The extent to which such employees are tested and the criteria for such testing shall be determined by the head of each agency, based upon the nature of the agency's mission and its employees&rsquo; duties, the efficient use of agency resources, and the danger to the public health and safety or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of each Executive agency shall establish a program for voluntary employee drug testing.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In addition to the testing authorized in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the head of each Executive agency is authorized to test an employee for illegal drug use under the following circumstances:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) When there is a reasonable suspicion that any employee uses illegal drugs;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) In an examination authorized by the agency regarding an accident or unsafe practice; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) As part of or as a follow-up to counseling or rehabilitation for illegal drug use through an Employee Assistance Program.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The head of each Executive agency is authorized to test any applicant for illegal drug use.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Drug Testing Procedures</em>. (a) Sixty days prior to the implementation of a drug testing program pursuant to this Order, agencies shall notify employees that testing for use of illegal drugs is to be conducted and that they may seek counseling and rehabilitation and inform them of the procedures for obtaining such assistance through the agency's Employee Assistance Program. Agency drug testing programs already ongoing are exempted from the 60-day notice requirement. Agencies may take action under section 3(c) of this Order without reference to the 60-day notice period.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Before conducting a drug test, the agency shall inform the employee to be tested of the opportunity to submit medical documentation that may support a legitimate use for a specific drug.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Drug testing programs shall contain procedures for timely submission of requests for retention of records and specimens; procedures for retesting; and procedures, consistent with applicable law, to protect the confidentiality of test results and related medical and rehabilitation records. Procedures for providing urine specimens must allow individual privacy, unless the agency has reason to believe that a particular individual may alter or substitute the specimen to be provided.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The Secretary of Health and Human Services is authorized to promulgate scientific and technical guidelines for drug testing programs, and agencies shall conduct their drug testing programs in accordance with these guidelines once promulgated.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>Personnel Actions</em>. (a) Agencies shall, in addition to any appropriate personnel actions, refer any employee who is found to use illegal drugs to an Employee Assistance Program for assessment, counseling, and referral for treatment or rehabilitation as appropriate.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Agencies shall initiate action to discipline any employee who is found to use illegal drugs, <em>provided that</em> such action is not required for an employee who:</p>

<p class="note-body">(2) Obtains counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Thereafter refrains from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Agencies shall not allow any employee to remain on duty in a sensitive position who is found to use illegal drugs, prior to successful completion of rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program. However, as part of a rehabilitation or counseling program, the head of an Executive agency may, in his or her discretion, allow an employee to return to duty in a sensitive position if it is determined that this action would not pose a danger to public health or safety or the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Agencies shall initiate action to remove from the service any employee who is found to use illegal drugs and:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) Refuses to obtain counseling or rehabilitation through an Employee Assistance Program; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Does not thereafter refrain from using illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The results of a drug test and information developed by the agency in the course of the drug testing of the employee may be considered in processing any adverse action against the employee or for other administrative purposes. Preliminary test results may not be used in an administrative proceeding unless they are confirmed by a second analysis of the same sample or unless the employee confirms the accuracy of the initial test by admitting the use of illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The determination of an agency that an employee uses illegal drugs can be made on the basis of any appropriate evidence, including direct observation, a criminal conviction, administrative inquiry, or the results of an authorized testing program. Positive drug test results may be rebutted by other evidence that an employee has not used illegal drugs.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Any action to discipline an employee who is using illegal drugs (including removal from the service, if appropriate) shall be taken in compliance with otherwise applicable procedures, including the Civil Service Reform Act [Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, see Tables for classification].</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Drug testing shall not be conducted pursuant to this Order for the purpose of gathering evidence for use in criminal proceedings. Agencies are not required to report to the Attorney General for investigation or prosecution any information, allegation, or evidence relating to violations of Title 21 of the United States Code received as a result of the operation of drug testing programs established pursuant to this Order.</p>

<p class="note-body">WHEREAS the American tradition that all persons should receive fair, impartial, and equitable treatment at the hands of the Government requires that all persons seeking the privilege of employment or privileged to be employed in the departments and agencies of the Government be adjudged by mutually consistent and no less than minimum standards and procedures among the departments and agencies governing the employment and retention in employment of persons in the Federal service:</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) The appointment of each civilian officer or employee in any department or agency of the Government shall be made subject to investigation. The scope of the investigation shall be determined in the first instance according to the degree of adverse effect the occupant of the position sought to be filled could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, on the national security, but in no event shall the investigation include less than a national agency check (including a check of the fingerprint files of the Federal Bureau of Investigation), and written inquiries to appropriate local law enforcement agencies, former employers and supervisors, references, and schools attended by the person under investigation: Provided, that upon request of the head of the department or agency concerned, the Office of Personnel Management may, in its discretion, authorize such less investigation as may meet the requirements of the national security with respect to per-diem, intermittent, temporary, or seasonal employees, or aliens employed outside the United States. Should there develop at any stage of investigation information indicating that the employment of any such person may not be clearly consistent with the interests of the national security, there shall be conducted with respect to such person a full field investigation, or such less investigation as shall be sufficient to enable the head of the department or agency concerned to determine whether retention of such person is clearly consistent with the interests of the national security.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of any department or agency shall designate, or cause to be designated, any position within his department or agency the occupant of which could bring about, by virtue of the nature of the position, a material adverse effect on the national security as a sensitive position. Any position so designated shall be filled or occupied only by a person with respect to whom a full field investigation has been conducted: Provided, that a person occupying a sensitive position at the time it is designated as such may continue to occupy such position pending the completion of a full field investigation, subject to the other provisions of this order: And provided further, that in case of emergency a sensitive position may be filled for a limited period by a person with respect to whom a full field pre-appointment investigation has not been completed if the head of the department or agency concerned finds that such action is necessary in the national interest, which finding shall be made a part of the records of such department or agency.</p>
