<p class="note-body">The proviso in paragraph (15) of former section 2211(b) is carried into section 5314. The remainder of paragraph (15) is omitted but not repealed, see table III. The part of paragraph (15) that is omitted but not repealed provides that the position of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall be in Level II of the Federal Executive Salary Schedule so long as the position is held by the incumbent of the position on August 14, 1964. The omission of this provision from title 5, without repealing the corresponding provision of the source statute, in effect leaves existing statute unchanged insofar as it relates to the present incumbent of the position of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provisos in paragraphs (39) and (46) of former section 2211(c) are carried into section 5315. The remainders of paragraphs (39) and (46) are omitted but not repealed, see table III. The parts of paragraphs (39) and (46) that are omitted but not repealed provide that the positions of Director of Selective Service and Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall be in Level III so long as the positions are held by the incumbents of the positions on August 14, 1964. The omission of these provisions from title 5, without repealing the corresponding provisions of the source statute, in effect, leaves existing statute unchanged insofar as it relates to the present incumbents of the positions of Director of Selective Service and Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>

<p class="note-body">The deletion of paragraph (41) of 5 U.S.C. 5314 reflects the abolition of the position of &ldquo;Deputy Administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency&rdquo; by the act of September 9, 1965, Public Law 89&ndash;174, sections 5(a), 9(c), 79 Stat. 669, 671.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (49), the words &ldquo;In lieu of receiving compensation at the rate prescribed by section 785(c) of this title&rdquo; are omitted since the provisions of 20 U.S.C. 785(c) relating to compensation are repealed by this bill; also see table II. The wording further reflects the first sentence of 20 U.S.C. 954(d), and conforms to 5 U.S.C. 5314 which applies to positions rather than individuals.</p>
