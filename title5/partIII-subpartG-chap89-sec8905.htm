<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Under regulations prescribed by the Office, the Office shall, before the start of any contract term in which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an adjustment is made in any of the rates charged or benefits provided under a health benefits plan described by section 8903 or 8903a of this title,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) In addition to any informational requirements otherwise applicable under this chapter, the regulations shall include provisions to ensure that each employee eligible to enroll in a health benefits plan under this chapter (whether actually enrolled or not) is notified in writing as to the rights afforded under section 8905a of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Notification under this paragraph shall be provided by employing agencies at an appropriate point in time before each period under paragraph (1) so that employees may be aware of their rights under section 8905a of this title when making enrollment decisions during such period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) An unenrolled employee who is required by a court or administrative order to provide health insurance coverage for a child who meets the requirements of section 8901(5) may enroll for self and family coverage in a health benefits plan under this chapter. If such employee fails to enroll for self and family coverage in a health benefits plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child resides, and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall enroll the employee in a self and family enrollment in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefit Plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee who is enrolled as an individual in a health benefits plan under this chapter and who is required by a court or administrative order to provide health insurance coverage for a child who meets the requirements of section 8901(5) may change to a self and family enrollment in the same or another health benefits plan under this chapter. If such employee fails to change to a self and family enrollment and the employee does not provide documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance, the employing agency shall change the enrollment of the employee to a self and family enrollment in the plan in which the employee is enrolled if that plan provides full benefits and services in the location where the child resides. If the plan in which the employee is enrolled does not provide full benefits and services in the location in which the child resides, or, if the employee fails to change to a self and family enrollment in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location where the child resides, the employing agency shall change the coverage of the employee to a self and family enrollment in the option which provides the lower level of coverage under the Service Benefits Plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The employee may not discontinue the self and family enrollment in a plan that provides full benefits and services in the location in which the child resides for so long as the court or administrative order remains in effect and the child continues to meet the requirements of section 8901(5), unless the employee provides documentation showing that such coverage has been provided through other health insurance.</p>
