<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;civil service in the executive branch&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;civil service of the United States&rdquo; to confirm the grant of authority in view of the definition of &ldquo;civil service&rdquo; in section 2101. The word &ldquo;will&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;may&rdquo;. The words &ldquo;for the employment sought&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;for the branch of service into which he seeks to enter&rdquo; as the latter are archaic since there are no &ldquo;branches&rdquo; within the executive branch.

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 3. (a) Upon consideration of the report of the Committee on Civil Service Improvement (House Document No. 118, 77th Congress) appointed by Executive Order No. 8044 of January 31, 1939, it is hereby found and determined that the regulations and procedures hereinafter prescribed in this section with respect to attorney positions in the classified civil service are required by the conditions of good administration.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) There is hereby created in the Office of Personnel Management (hereinafter referred to as the Office) a board to be known as the Board of Legal Examiners (hereinafter referred to as the Board). The Board shall consist of the Solicitor General of the United States and the chief law officer of the Office of Personnel Management, as members <em>ex officio,</em> and nine members to be appointed by the President, four of whom shall be attorneys chosen from the chief officers of the Executive departments, agencies or corporate instrumentalities of the Government, two from the law-teaching profession, and three from attorneys engaged in private practice. The President shall designate the chairman of the Board. Five members shall constitute a quorum, and the Board may transact business notwithstanding vacancies thereon. Members of the Board shall receive no salary as such, but shall be entitled to necessary expenses incurred in the performance of their duties hereunder.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) It shall be the duty of the Board to promote the development of a merit system for the recruitment, selection, appointment, promotion, and transfer of attorneys in the classified civil service in accordance with the general procedures outlined in Plan A of the report of the Committee on Civil Service Improvement, appointed by Executive Order No. 8044 of January 31, 1939.</p>

<p class="note-body">(e) The Office shall in the manner determined by the Board establish a register or registers for attorney positions in the classified service and such positions shall thereafter be filled from such registers as are designated by the Board. Unless otherwise determined by the Board, any register so established shall not be in effect for a period longer than one year from the date of <!-- PDFPage:179 -->its establishment. Upon request of the Board, the Office shall appoint regional or local boards of examiners composed of persons approved by the Board, within or without the Federal service, to interview and examine applicants as the Board shall direct.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The number of names to be placed upon any register of eligibles for attorney positions shall be limited to the number recommended by the Board; and such registers shall not be ranked according to the ratings received by the eligibles, except that persons entitled to veterans&rsquo; preference as defined in section 1 of Civil Service Rule VI shall be appropriately designated thereon.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Any person whose name has been placed upon three registers of eligibles covering positions of the same grade, and who has not been appointed therefrom, shall not thereafter be eligible for placement upon any subsequently established register covering positions of such grade.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) So far as practicable and consistent with good administration, the eligibles on any register for attorney positions and appointments for such register shall be apportioned among the several States and Territories and the District of Columbia upon the basis of population as ascertained in the last preceding census.

<p class="note-body">(k) The Office with the approval of the Board shall appoint a competent person to act as Executive Secretary to the Board; and the Office shall furnish such further professionals, clerical, stenographic, and other assistants as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 4. The noncompetitive examinations prescribed pursuant to sections 3 and 6 of this order and section 2(a) of the said act of November 26, 1940, shall, among other things, require any person taking such examination to meet such reasonable standards of physical fitness and personal suitability as the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 5. Persons who on the effective date of section 1 of this order are on furlough or leave without pay from any position covered into the classified service by that section may be recalled to duty within one year of the date that they are furloughed or given leave without pay, and may be continued in such positions thereafter but shall not thereby acquire a classified civil-service status. If they are not recalled to duty within the time specified herein, they shall be separated from the service.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.1. Positions and Employees Affected by These Rules</h4>
<p class="note-body">These Rules shall apply to all positions in the competitive service and to all incumbents of such positions. Except as expressly provided in the Rule concerned, these Rules shall not apply to positions and employees in the excepted service.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:180 --><h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.2. Extent of the Competitive Service</h4>

The Office is authorized and directed to determine finally whether a position is in the competitive service.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.3. Definitions</h4>
<p class="note-body">As used in these Rules:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Competitive service&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as the words &ldquo;classified service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;classified (competitive) service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;classified civil service&rdquo; as defined in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Competitive position&rdquo; shall mean a position in the competitive service.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Competitive status&rdquo; shall mean basic eligibility to be noncompetitively selected to fill a vacancy in a competitive position. A competitive status shall be acquired by career-conditional or career appointment through open competitive examination upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, or may be granted by statute, executive order, or the Civil Service Rules without competitive examination. A person with competitive status may be promoted, transferred, reassigned, reinstated, or demoted without taking an open competitive examination, subject to the conditions prescribed by the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) An employee shall be considered as being in the competitive service when he has a competitive status and occupies a competitive position unless he is serving under a temporary appointment: <em>Provided,</em> That an employee who is in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C shall be considered as continuing in the competitive service as long as he continues to occupy such position.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) &ldquo;Tenure&rdquo; shall mean the period of time an employee may reasonably expect to serve under his current appointment. Tenure shall be granted and governed by the type of appointment under which an employee is currently serving without regard to whether he has a competitive status or whether his appointment is to a competitive position or an excepted position.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;1.4. Extent of the Excepted Service</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) The excepted service shall include all civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government which are specifically excepted from the requirements of the Civil Service Act or from the competitive service by or pursuant to statute or by the Office under section 6.1 of Rule VI.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Excepted service&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as the words &ldquo;unclassified service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;unclassified civil service&rdquo;, or &ldquo;positions outside the competitive civil service&rdquo; as used in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) &ldquo;Excepted position&rdquo; shall have the same meaning as &ldquo;unclassified position&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by law&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by executive order&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position excepted by Civil Service Rule&rdquo;, or &ldquo;position outside the competitive service&rdquo; as used in existing statutes and executive orders.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Rule II&mdash;Appointment Through the Competitive System</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.1. Competitive Examinations and Eligible Registers</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Office shall be responsible for open competitive examinations for admission to the competitive service which will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined for the position to be filled. The Office is authorized to establish standards with respect to citizenship, age, education, training and experience, suitability, and physical and mental fitness, and for residence or other requirements which applicants must meet to be admitted to or rated in examinations.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In addition to the names of persons who qualify in competitive examinations, the names of persons who have lost eligibility on a career or career-conditional register because of service in the armed forces, and the names of persons who lost opportunity for certification or who have served under career or career-conditional appointment when the Office determines that they should be given certification, may also be entered at such places on appropriate registers and under such conditions as the Office may prescribe.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Whenever the Office of Personnel Management (1) is unable to certify a sufficient number of names to permit the appointing officer to consider three eligibles for appointment to a fourth-class postmaster position in accordance with the regular procedure, or (2) finds that a particular rate of compensation for fourth-class postmaster positions is too low to warrant regular competitive examinations for such positions, it may authorize appointment to any such position or positions in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed by the Office. Persons appointed under this subsection may acquire competitive status subject to satisfactory completion of a probationary period prescribed by the Office.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.2. Appointments</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) The Office shall establish and administer a career-conditional appointment system for positions subject to competitive examination which will permit adjustment of the career service to necessary fluctuations in Federal employment, and provide an equitable and orderly system for stabilizing the Federal work force. A competitive status shall be acquired by a career-conditional appointee upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, but the appointee shall have career-conditional tenure for a period of service to be prescribed by regulation of the Office. When an employee has completed the required period of service his appointment shall be converted to a career appointment without time limitation: <em>Provided,</em> That his career-conditional appointment shall not be converted to a career appointment if the limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service established under subsection (b) of this section would be exceeded thereby. Persons selected from competitive civil service registers for other than temporary appointment shall be given career-conditional appointments: <em>Provided,</em> That career appointments shall be given to the following classes of eligibles: (1) Persons whose appointments are required by statute to be made on a permanent basis; (2) employees serving under career appointments at the time of selections from such registers; (3) former employees who have eligibility for career appointments upon reinstatement; and (4) to the extent permitted by law, persons appointed to positions in the field service of the Post Office Department for which salary rates are fixed by the act of July 6, 1945, 59 Stat. 435, as heretofore or hereafter amended and supplemented.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Under the career-conditional appointment system there shall be a limit on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service which shall be the ceiling established by section 1310 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1952 (65 Stat. 757), as amended [set out as a note under section 3101 of this title]. In the event section 1310, supra, is repealed, the Office is authorized to fix such limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service as it finds necessary to meet the needs of the service.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) The Office may determine the types, duration, and conditions of indefinite and temporary appointments, and may prescribe the method for replacing persons holding such appointments.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:181 --><h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.3. Apportionment</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subject to such modifications as the Office finds to be necessary in the interest of good administration, appointments to positions in agencies&rsquo; headquarters offices which are located within the metropolitan area of Washington, D.C., shall be made so as to maintain the apportionment of appointments among the several States, Territories, and the District of Columbia upon the basis of population.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;2.4. Probationary Period</h4>
<p class="note-body">Persons selected from registers of eligibles for career or career-conditional appointment and employees promoted, transferred, or otherwise assigned, for the first time, to supervisory or managerial positions shall be required to serve a probationary period under terms and conditions prescribed by the Office.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Rule III&mdash;Noncompetitive Acquisition of Status</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.1. Classes of Persons Who May Noncompetitively Acquire Status</h4>
<p class="note-body">(a) Upon recommendation by the agency concerned, and subject to such noncompetitive examination, time limits, or other requirements as the Office may prescribe, the following classes of persons may acquire a competitive status without competitive examination:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A person holding a permanent position when it is placed in the competitive service by statute or executive order or is otherwise made subject to competitive examination.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A disabled veteran who, in a manner satisfactory to the Office, has completed a course of training in the executive branch of the Government prescribed by the Administrator of Veterans&rsquo; Affairs in accordance with the act of March 24, 1943, 57 Stat. 43.</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) An employee who has served at least two years in the immediate office of the President or on the White House Staff and who is transferred to a competitive position at the request of an agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) An employee who was serving when his name was reached for certification on a civil-service register appropriate for the position in which he was serving: <em>Provided,</em> That the recommendation for competitive status is made prior to expiration of the register on which his name appears or is made during a period of continuous service since his name was reached: <em>Provided further,</em> That the register was being used for appointments conferring competitive status at the time his name was reached.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Upon recommendation by the employing agency, and subject to such requirements as the Office of Personnel Management may prescribe, the following classes of handicapped employees may acquire competitive status without competitive examination:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A severely physically handicapped employee who completes at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service.</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) A mentally retarded employee who completes at least two years of satisfactory service in a position excepted from the competitive service.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.2. Appointments Without Competitive Examination in Rare Cases</h4>
<p class="note-body">Subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of the qualifications of the person to be appointed, the Office may authorize an appointment in the competitive service without competitive examination whenever it finds that the duties or compensation of the position are such, or that qualified persons are so rare, that, in the interest of good civil-service administration, the position cannot be filled through open competitive examination. Any person heretofore or hereafter appointed under this section shall acquire a competitive status upon completion of at least one year of satisfactory service and compliance with such requirements as the Office may prescribe. Detailed statements of the reasons for the noncompetitive appointments made under this section shall be published in the Office's annual reports.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&sect;3.3. Conversion of Appointments</h4>
