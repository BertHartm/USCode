<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;Executive department&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;department&rdquo; as the definition of &ldquo;department&rdquo; applicable to this section is coextensive with the definition of &ldquo;Executive department&rdquo; in section 101. The words &ldquo;not inconsistent with law&rdquo; are omitted as surplusage as a regulation which is inconsistent with law is invalid.</p>
<p class="note-body">The words &ldquo;or military department&rdquo; are inserted to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Secu<!-- PDFPage:13 -->rity Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;All laws, orders, regulations, and other actions relating to the National Military Establishment, the Departments of the Army, the Navy, or the Air Force, or to any officer or activity of such establishment or such departments, shall, except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act, have the same effect as if this Act had not been enacted; but, after the effective date of this Act, any such law, order, regulation, or other action which vested functions in or otherwise related to any officer, department, or establishment, shall be deemed to have vested such function in or relate to the officer, or department, executive or military, succeeding the officer, department, or establishment in which such function was vested. For purposes of this subsection the Department of Defense shall be deemed the department succeeding the National Military Establishment, and the military departments of Army, Navy, and Air Force shall be deemed the departments succeeding the Executive Departments of Army, Navy, and Air Force.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">This section was part of title IV of the Revised Statutes. The Act of July 26, 1947, ch. 343, &sect;201(d), as added Aug. 10, 1949, ch. 412, &sect;4, 63 Stat. 579 (former 5 U.S.C. 171&ndash;1), which provides &ldquo;Except to the extent inconsistent with the provisions of this Act [National Security Act of 1947], the provisions of title IV of the Revised Statutes as now or hereafter amended shall be applicable to the Department of Defense&rdquo; is omitted from this title but is not repealed.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>

The word &ldquo;thereof&rdquo; is added to reflect the proper relationship between &ldquo;department&rdquo; and &ldquo;bureau&rdquo; as reflected in title IV of the Revised Statutes of 1878. The words &ldquo;in any State, District, or Territory&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.

The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.</p>
