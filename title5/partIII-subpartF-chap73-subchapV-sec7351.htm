<p class="note-body">The application of the section is confined to employees, since the President and Members of Congress, though officers, could not have been intended to be &ldquo;summarily discharged&rdquo;, and members of uniformed services are not covered by this statute. In the last sentence, the word &ldquo;removed&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;summarily discharged&rdquo; because of the provisions of the Lloyd-LaFollette Act, 37 Stat. 555, as amended, and the Veterans&rsquo; Preference Act of 1944, 58 Stat. 387, as amended, which are carried into this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
