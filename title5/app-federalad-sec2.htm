<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Congress finds that there are numerous committees, boards, commissions, councils, and similar groups which have been established to advise officers and agencies in the executive branch of the Federal Government and that they are frequently a useful and beneficial means of furnishing expert advice, ideas, and diverse opinions to the Federal Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress further finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the need for many existing advisory committees has not been adequately reviewed:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) new advisory committees should be established only when they are determined to be essential and their number should be kept to the minimum necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) advisory committees should be terminated when they are no longer carrying out the purposes for which they were established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) standards and uniform procedures should govern the establishment, operation, administration, and duration of advisory committees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Congress and the public should be kept informed with respect to the number, purpose, membership, activities, and cost of advisory committees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the function of advisory committees should be advisory only, and that all matters under their consideration should be determined, in accordance with law, by the official, agency, or officer involved.</p>
