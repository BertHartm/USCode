<p class="note-body">The authority of the President to prescribe rules is added on authority of former section 633(1), which is carried into section 3302. Wording is changed because in practice an appointment is not made after probation. The words &ldquo;or employment&rdquo; are omitted as included within &ldquo;appointment&rdquo;.</p>
