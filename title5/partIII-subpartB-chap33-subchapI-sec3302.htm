<p class="note-body">The reference to the competitive service is substituted for the reference to the Act creating that service. The reference to reasons for the exceptions is omitted as covered by section 1308 of this title. The words &ldquo;provide for&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;provide and declare&rdquo;. Paragraph (1) is supplied to preserve the President's power to except positions from the competitive service, previously implied from the power to except from the first rule in former section 633(2). Authority to make exceptions to so much of former section 633(2) as is restated in this section and section 1302(a) is omitted as meaningless. Authority to make exceptions to so much of former section 633(2) as is restated in section 3318(a) is omitted as superseded by former section 857, which is carried into section 3318(a). In the last sentence, the words &ldquo;Each officer and individual employed in an agency&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;officers of the United States in the departments and offices&rdquo; because of the restrictive definition of &ldquo;officer&rdquo; in section 2104.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>

<p class="note-body">1979&mdash;Par. (2). Pub. L. 96&ndash;54 amended par. (2) in same manner as amendment by section 703(c)(1) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;454. See 1978 Amendment note below.</p>
<p class="note-body">1978&mdash;Par. (2). Pub. L. 95&ndash;454 substituted &ldquo;7202, 7203&rdquo; for &ldquo;7152, 7153&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 95&ndash;228 struck out reference to section 3306(a)(1) of this title. Amendments by section 703(c)(1) and (c)(2) of Pub. L. 95&ndash;454 appear to have been inadvertently reversed. Subsec. (c)(1) purported to amend subsec. (c)(1) of section 2105 of this title, and subsec. (c)(2) purported to amend par. (2) of this section. However, the amendments specified by Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, &sect;703(c)(1) and (2), were impossible to execute literally. Thus, amendment by Pub. L. 95&ndash;454, &sect;703(c)(2) was executed to section 2105 of this title, and amendment by section 703(c)(1) was executed to this section as the probable intent of Congress.</p>
