The excess annual leave is reduced at the beginning of the first full biweekly pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, occurring in a year, by the amount of annual leave the employee used during the preceding year in excess of the amount which accrued during that year, until the employee's accumulated leave does not exceed the amount allowed under subsection (a) or (b) of this section, as appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Annual leave which is lost by operation of this section because of&mdash;</p>

Leave credited under this paragraph but unused and still available to the employee under the regulations prescribed by the Office shall be included in the lump-sum payment under section 5551 or 5552(1) of this title but may not be retained to the credit of the employee under section 5552(2) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;Department of Defense emergency essential employee&rdquo; means an employee of the Department of Defense who is designated under section 1580 of title 10 as an emergency essential employee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the term &ldquo;combat zone&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 112(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960, which is lost by operation of this section because of administrative error and which is not credited under subsection (d)(2) of this section because the employee is separated before the error is discovered, is subject to credit and liquidation by lump-sum payment only if a claim therefor is filed within 3 years immediately following the date of discovery of the error. Payment shall be made by the agency of employment when the lump-sum payment provisions of section 5551 of this title last became applicable to the employee at the rate of basic pay in effect on the date the lump-sum provisions became applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) This subsection applies with respect to annual leave accrued by an individual while serving in a position in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the Senior Executive Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Senior Foreign Service;</p>
