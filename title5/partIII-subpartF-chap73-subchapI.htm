<p class="note-body">I, RONALD REAGAN, President of the United States of America, find that:</p>
<p class="note-body">Drug use is having serious adverse effects upon a significant proportion of the national work force and results in billions of dollars of lost productivity each year;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal government, as an employer, is concerned with the well-being of its employees, the successful accomplishment of agency missions, and the need to maintain employee productivity;</p>
<p class="note-body">The Federal government, as the largest employer in the Nation, can and should show the way towards achieving drug-free workplaces through a program designed to offer drug users a helping hand and, at the same time, demonstrating to drug users and potential drug users that drugs will not be tolerated in the Federal workplace;</p>
<p class="note-body">The profits from illegal drugs provide the single greatest source of income for organized crime, fuel violent street crime, and otherwise contribute to the breakdown of our society;</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees is inconsistent not only with the law-abiding behavior expected of all citizens, but also with the special trust placed in such employees as servants of the public;</p>
<p class="note-body">Federal employees who use illegal drugs, on or off duty, tend to be less productive, less reliable, and prone to greater absenteeism than their fellow employees who do not use illegal drugs;</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees impairs the efficiency of Federal departments and agencies, undermines public confidence in them, and makes it more difficult for other employees who do not use illegal drugs to perform their jobs effectively. The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees also can pose a serious health and safety threat to members of the public and to other Federal employees;</p>
<p class="note-body">The use of illegal drugs, on or off duty, by Federal employees in certain positions evidences less than the complete reliability, stability, and good judgment that is consistent with access to sensitive information and creates the possibility of coercion, influence, and irresponsible action under pressure that may pose a serious risk to national security, the public safety, and the effective enforcement of the law; and</p>

<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Drug-Free Workplace</em>. (a) Federal employees are required to refrain from the use of illegal drugs.</p>

<p class="note-body">(b) Each agency plan shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) A statement of policy setting forth the agency's expectations regarding drug use and the action to be anticipated in response to identified drug use;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) Employee Assistance Programs emphasizing high level direction, education, counseling, referral to rehabilitation, and coordination with available community resources;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) Supervisory training to assist in identifying and addressing illegal drug use by agency employees;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) Provision for self-referrals as well as supervisory referrals to treatment with maximum respect for individual confidentiality consistent with safety and security issues; and</p>

<!-- PDFPage:602 --><p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Drug Testing Programs</em>. (a) The head of each Executive agency shall establish a program to test for the use of illegal drugs by employees in sensitive positions. The extent to which such employees are tested and the criteria for such testing shall be determined by the head of each agency, based upon the nature of the agency's mission and its employees&rsquo; duties, the efficient use of agency resources, and the danger to the public health and safety or national security that could result from the failure of an employee adequately to discharge his or her position.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The head of each Executive agency shall establish a program for voluntary employee drug testing.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) In addition to the testing authorized in subsections (a) and (b) of this section, the head of each Executive agency is authorized to test an employee for illegal drug use under the following circumstances:</p>
