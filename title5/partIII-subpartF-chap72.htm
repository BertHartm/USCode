<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) &ldquo;category of civil service employment&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that each Executive agency conduct a continuing program for the recruitment of members of minorities for positions in the agency to carry out the policy set forth in subsection (b) in a manner designed to eliminate underrepresentation of minorities in the various categories of civil service employment within the Federal service, with special efforts directed at recruiting in minority communities, in educational institutions, and from other sources from which minorities can be recruited; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that the Office conduct a continuing program of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) assistance to agencies in carrying out programs under paragraph (1) of this subsection, and</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;Executive department&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;department&rdquo; as the definition of &ldquo;department&rdquo; applicable to this section is coextensive with the definition of &ldquo;Executive department&rdquo; in section 101.

Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this subsection, which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301. The words &ldquo;in the discretion of&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary in view of the permissive grant of authority.
