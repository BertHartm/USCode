<br class="Q04" />

<!-- PDFPage:809 --><p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If a former employee or Member dies after having separated from the service with title to a deferred annuity under section 8413 but before having established a valid claim for an annuity, and is survived by a widow or widower to whom married on the date of separation, the widow or widower may elect to receive&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an annuity under paragraph (2); or</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The present value of the annuity of a widow or widower who chooses the earlier commencement date under clause (i)(II) shall be actuarially equivalent to the present value of an annuity computed for the widow or widower, determined as if the commencement date under clause (i)(I) were applicable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) The annuity of a widow or widower under this section commences on the day after the death of the individual on whose service such annuity is based. This annuity and the right thereto terminate on the last day of the month before the widow or widower&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e) The requirement in paragraphs (1)(A) and (2)(A) of section 8441 that the widow or widower of an annuitant, employee, or Member, or of a former employee or Member, have been married to such individual for at least 9 months immediately before the death of the individual in order to qualify as the widow or widower of such individual shall be deemed satisfied in any case in which the individual dies within the applicable 9-month period, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the death of the individual was accidental; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the surviving spouse of the individual had been previously married to such individual and subsequently divorced, and the aggregate time married is at least 9 months.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Subject to paragraph (4), a survivor who is entitled to an annuity under subsection (a) shall also be entitled to a supplementary annuity under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A supplementary annuity under this subsection shall be equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount by which the survivor's assumed CSRS annuity exceeds the annuity payable to such survivor under subsection (a); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount determined under paragraph (3).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount under this paragraph for a survivor is the amount of widow's or widower's insurance benefits which would be payable to such survivor under title II of the Social Security Act (without regard to sections 202(e)(7), 202(f)(2), and 203 of such Act) based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant, and determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) as of the date on which the annuitant died; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made application for those benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of such Act, as the case may be.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any computation or determination under this paragraph shall be made in accordance with the applicable provisions of the Social Security Act, except that in computing any primary insurance amount under section 215 of such Act for purposes of determining an amount under <!-- PDFPage:810 -->this subsection, subparagraphs (A) and (C) of section 8421(b)(2) shall apply.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A supplementary annuity under this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be payable to a survivor only for calendar months ending before the calendar month in which such survivor first satisfies the minimum age requirement under section 202(e)(1)(B)(i) or 202(f)(1)(B)(i) of the Social Security Act, as the case may be;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall not be payable to a survivor who would not be entitled to benefits under subsection (e) or (f) of section 202 of the Social Security Act based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant (determined, as of the date of the annuitant's death, as if the survivor had attained age 60 and made appropriate application for benefits, but without regard to any restriction under either such subsection relating to remarriage); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) shall not be payable to a survivor for any calendar month in which such survivor is entitled (or would, on proper application, be entitled) to benefits under section 202(g) of the Social Security Act (relating to mother's and father's insurance benefits), or under section 202(e) or (f) of such Act by reason of having become disabled, based on the wages and self-employment income of the deceased annuitant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purpose of this subsection, the term &ldquo;assumed CSRS annuity&rdquo;, as used in the case of a survivor, means the amount of the annuity to which such survivor would be entitled under subchapter III of chapter 83 of this title based on the service of the deceased annuitant, determined&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) as of the day after the date of the annuitant's death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) as if the survivor had made appropriate application therefor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) as if the service of the deceased annuitant were creditable under such subchapter.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) An amount payable under this subsection shall be adjusted under section 8462 and shall otherwise be treated under this chapter in the same way as an amount payable under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) If the widow or widower of an annuitant under section 8452 (hereinafter in this subsection referred to as a &ldquo;disability annuitant&rdquo;) is determined under subsection (a) to be entitled to an annuity based on the service of such disability annuitant, the annuity of the widow or widower shall be equal to 50 percent of the amount determined under paragraph (2) (or one-half thereof if designated for this purpose under section 8419 of this title), rather than of the amount referred to in subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the amount on which the annuity of the widow or widower of a disability annuitant is based shall be the amount of the annuity to which such disability annuitant was entitled, as computed under section 8452 (including appropriate reduction under subsection (a)(2) of such section and any adjustments under section 8462 allowed under section 8452), as of the day before the date of the disability annuitant's death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In the case of a widow or widower entitled to an annuity based on the service of a disability annuitant who dies before age 62, the amount under clause (ii) shall apply instead of the amount which would otherwise apply under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), the amount of the annuity to which the disability annuitant was entitled as of the day before the date of death shall be considered to be the amount which would be computed with respect to such disability annuitant under section 8452(b) if the disability annuitant had attained age 62 on the day before date of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(II) For purposes of any such computation under section 8452(b)(2) pursuant to this clause, creditable service shall (in addition to the service which would otherwise be used under subparagraph (B)(i) of such section) include the period of time between date of death and the date of the sixty-second anniversary of the birth of the annuitant, and average pay shall be adjusted in accordance with subparagraph (B)(ii) of such section only through date of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) The following rules shall apply notwithstanding any other provision of this section:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The annuity payable under this section to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount of the annuity which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the amount of the annuity payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election made under section 8417(b) or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in section 8445(a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The amount payable under subsection (b)(1)(A) to a widow or widower may not exceed the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the amount which would otherwise be payable to such widow or widower under such subsection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the portion of such amount payable to any former spouse of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) A lump-sum credit under subsection (c)(2) shall be subject to the same terms and conditions as apply with respect to a lump-sum credit under section 8424(b).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The annuity payable to a former spouse under this section may not exceed the difference between&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the amount applicable in the case of such former spouse, as determined under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the amount of any annuity payable under this section to any other former spouse of the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, based on an election previously made under section 8417(b), or a court order previously issued or agreement previously entered into as described in subsection (a).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The applicable amount, for purposes of paragraph (1)(A) in the case of a former spouse, is the amount of the annuity which would be payable under the provisions of section 8442 (including subsection (f) of such section, but without regard to subsection (h) of such section) if such former spouse were a widow or widower entitled to an annuity under such provisions based on the service of the deceased employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The commencement and termination of an annuity payable under this section shall be governed by the terms of the applicable order, decree, agreement, or election, as the case may be, except that any such annuity&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall not commence before&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the day after the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, dies; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">whichever is later; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) except as provided in subsection (h), shall terminate no later than the last day of the month before the former spouse remarries before becoming 55 years of age or dies.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) For purposes of this chapter, a modification in a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in subsection (a) shall not be effective&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) if such modification is made after the retirement or death of the employee, Member, or annuitant, or former employee or Member, concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to the extent that such modification involves an annuity under this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of this chapter, a decree, order, agreement, or election referred to in subsection (a) shall not be effective, in the case of a former spouse, to the extent that it is inconsistent with any joint waiver previously executed with respect to such former spouse under section 8416(a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Any amount under section 8442(b)(1)(A) which would otherwise be payable to a widow or widower based on the service of another individual shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Office to a former spouse of such individual if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of a court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or the terms of a court order or court-approved property settlement incident to any decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall apply only to payments made by the Office after the date of receipt in the Office of written notice of such decree, order, or agreement, and such additional information and documentation as the Office may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any payment under this section to a person bars recovery by any other person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) Subsection (c)(2) (to the extent that it provides for termination of a survivor annuity because of a remarriage before age 55) shall not apply if the former spouse was married for at least 30 years to the individual on whose service the survivor annuity is based.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A remarriage described in paragraph (1) shall not be taken into account for purposes of section 8419(b)(1)(B) or any other provision of this chapter which the Office may by regulation identify in order to carry out the purposes of this subsection.</p>
