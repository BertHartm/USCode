<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;base quarter&rdquo;, as used with respect to a year, means the calendar quarter ending on September 30 of such year;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the price index for a base quarter is the arithmetical mean of such index for the 3 months comprising such quarter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the term &ldquo;percent change in the price index&rdquo;, as used with respect to a year, means the percentage derived by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) reducing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the price index for the base quarter of such year, by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the price index for the base quarter of the preceding year in which an adjustment under this subsection was made;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) dividing the difference under subparagraph (A) by the price index referred to in subparagraph (A)(ii); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) multiplying the quotient under subparagraph (B) by 100.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Except as provided in subsection (c), effective December 1 of any year in which an adjustment under this subsection is to be made, as determined under paragraph (2), each annuity payable from the Fund under this chapter (other than an annuity under section 8443) having a commencing date not later than such December 1 shall be adjusted as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) If the percent change in the price index for the year does not exceed 3 percent, each annuity subject to adjustment under this subsection shall be increased by the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the percent change in the price index (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 2 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) If the percent change in the price index for the year exceeds 3 percent, each annuity subject to adjustment under this subsection shall be increased by the excess of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the percent change in the price index (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent), over</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) 1 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An adjustment under this subsection shall be made in a year only if the price index for the base quarter of such year exceeds the price index for the base quarter of the preceding year in which an adjustment under this subsection was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An annuity under this chapter shall not be subject to adjustment under section 8340. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall affect the computation of any amount under section 8443(a)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Eligibility for an annuity increase under this section is governed by the commencing date of each annuity payable from the Fund as of the effective date of an increase, except as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The first increase (if any) made under subsection (b) to an annuity which is payable from the Fund to an annuitant or survivor (other than a child under section 8443) whose annuity has not been increased under this subsection or subsection (b) shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) one-twelfth of the applicable percent change computed under subsection (b), multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of months (not to exceed 12 months, counting any portion of a month as a month)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) for which the annuity was payable from the Fund before the effective date of the increase; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in the case of a survivor of a deceased annuitant whose annuity has not been so <!-- PDFPage:849 -->increased, since the annuity was first payable to the deceased annuitant.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Effective from its commencing date, an annuity payable from the Fund to an annuitant's survivor (other than a widow or widower whose annuity is computed under section 8442(g) or a child under section 8443) shall be increased by the total percentage by which the deceased annuitant's annuity had been increased under this section during the period beginning on the date the deceased annuitant's annuity commenced and ending on the date of the deceased annuitant's death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) An adjustment under subsection (b) for any year shall not be effective with respect to the annuity of an annuitant who is under 62 years of age as of the date on which such adjustment would otherwise first take effect.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Except as provided in clause (ii), this paragraph applies only with respect to an annuitant under section 8412, 8413, or 8414.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) This paragraph does not apply with respect to an annuitant under subsection (d) or (e) of section 8412 or (in the case of an annuitant separated from service as a military reserve technician as a result of disability) under section 8414(c).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The first increase (if any) made under subsection (b) to an annuity which is payable from the Fund to a widow or widower whose annuity is computed under section 8442(g) shall be equal to the product (adjusted to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) one-twelfth of the applicable percent change computed under subsection (b), multiplied by</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the number of months (not to exceed 12 months, counting any portion of a month as a month) since&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the effective date of the adjustment last made under this section in the annuity of the annuitant on whose service on the widow's or widower's annuity is based; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the annuity of the annuitant (referred to in clause (i)) has not been increased under this section, the commencement date of such annuitant's annuity (determined subject to section 8452(a)(1)(B)).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The monthly installment of an annuity after adjustment under this section shall be rounded to the next lowest dollar. However, the monthly installment shall, after adjustment, reflect an increase of at least $1.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) The $15,000 amount referred to in section 8442(b)(1)(A)(ii) shall be increased at the same time that, and by the same percent as the percentage by which, annuities under subchapter III of chapter 83 are increased.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) If an annuitant, except a disability annuitant whose annuity is terminated because of the annuitant's recovery or restoration of earning capacity, becomes employed in an appointive or elective position, an amount equal to the annuity allocable to the period of actual employment shall be deducted from the annuitant's pay, except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under section 5551. Unless the annuitant's appointment is on an intermittent basis or is to a position as a justice or judge (as defined by section 451 of title 28) or as an employee subject to another retirement system for Government employees, or unless the annuitant is serving as President, deductions for the Fund shall be withheld from the annuitant's pay under section 8422(a) and contributions under section 8423 shall be made. The deductions and contributions referred to in the preceding provisions of this subsection shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund. The annuitant's lump-sum credit may not be reduced by annuity paid during the reemployment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A) If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for at least 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, the annuitant's annuity on termination of reemployment shall be increased by an annuity computed under section 8415(a) through (g) as may apply based on the period of reemployment and the basic pay, before deduction, averaged during the reemployment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) If the annuitant is receiving a reduced annuity as provided in section 8419, the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A) is reduced by 10 percent and the survivor annuity or combination of survivor annuities payable under section 8442 or 8445 (or both) is increased by 50 percent of the increase in annuity payable under subparagraph (A), unless, at the time of claiming the increase payable under subparagraph (A), the annuitant notifies the Office in writing that the annuitant does not desire the survivor annuity to be increased.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If an annuitant who is subject to the deductions referred to in subparagraph (A) dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for not less than 1 year of full-time service (or the equivalent thereof, in the case of full-time&nbsp;<sup><a href="#8468_1_target" name="8468_1">1</a></sup> employment), the survivor annuity payable is increased as though the reemployment had otherwise terminated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for at least 5 years, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 5 years of full-time service, the annuitant may elect, instead of the benefit provided by paragraph (1), to have such annuitant's rights redetermined under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If an annuitant who is subject to the deductions referred to in subparagraph (A) dies while still reemployed, after having been reemployed for at least 5 years of full-time service (or the equivalent thereof in the case of part-time employment), any person entitled to a survivor annuity under section 8442 or 8445 based on the service of such annuitant shall be permitted to elect, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, to have such person's rights under subchapter IV redetermined. A redetermined survivor annuity elected under this subparagraph shall be in lieu of an increased annuity which would otherwise <!-- PDFPage:852 -->be payable in accordance with paragraph (1)(B)(ii).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If an annuitant subject to deductions under the second sentence of subsection (a) serves on a full-time basis for a period of less than 1 year, or on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to less than 1 year of full-time service, the total amount withheld under section 8422(a) from the annuitant's basic pay for the period or periods involved shall, upon written application to the Office, be payable to the annuitant (or the appropriate survivor or survivors, determined in the order set forth in section 8424(d)).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) This section does not apply to an individual appointed to serve as a Governor of the Board of Governors of the United States Postal Service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If an annuitant becomes employed as a justice or judge of the United States, as defined by section 451 of title 28, the annuitant may, at any time prior to resignation or retirement from regular active service as such a justice or judge, apply for and be paid, in accordance with section 8424(a), the amount (if any) by which the lump-sum credit exceeds the total annuity paid, notwithstanding the time limitation contained in such section for filing an application for payment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) A reference in this section to an &ldquo;annuity&rdquo; shall not be considered to include any amount payable from a source other than the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management may, at the request of the head of an Executive agency&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) waive the application of the preceding provisions of this section on a case-by-case basis for employees in positions for which there is exceptional difficulty in recruiting or retaining a qualified employee; or</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) If warranted by circumstances described in subsection (f)(1)(A) or (B) (as applicable), the Director of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts shall, with respect to an employee in the judicial branch, have the same waiver authority as would be available to the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, or a duly authorized agency head, under subsection (f) with respect to an employee of an Executive agency.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8469. Withholding of State income taxes</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Office shall, in accordance with this section, enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of a request for agreement from the proper State official. The agreement shall provide that the Office shall withhold State income tax in the case of the monthly annuity of any annuitant who voluntarily requests, in writing, such withholding. The amounts withheld during any calendar quarter shall be held in the Fund and disbursed to the States during the month following that calendar quarter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An annuitant may have in effect at any time only one request for withholding under this section, and an annuitant may not have more than two such requests in effect during any one calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subject to subsection (b), an annuitant may change the State designated by that annuitant for purposes of having withholdings made, and may request that the withholdings be remitted in accordance with such change. An annuitant also may revoke any request of that annuitant for withholding. Any change in the State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of the month after the month in which the request or the revocation is processed by the Office, but in no event later than on the first day of the second month beginning after the day on which such request or revocation is received by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This section does not give the consent of the United States to the application of a statute which imposes more burdensome requirements on the United States than on employers generally, or which subjects the United States or any annuitant to a penalty or liability because of this section. The Office may not accept pay from a State for services performed in withholding State income taxes from annuities. Any amount erroneously withheld from an annuity and paid to a State by the Office shall be repaid by the State in accordance with regulations issued by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For the purpose of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;State&rdquo; means a State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the term &ldquo;annuitant&rdquo; includes a survivor who is receiving an annuity from the Fund.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8470. Exemption from legal process; recovery of payments</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An amount payable under subchapter II, IV, or V of this chapter is not assignable, either in law or equity, except under the provisions of section 8465 or 8467, or subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment or other legal process, except as otherwise may be provided by Federal laws.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Recovery of payments under subchapter II, IV, or V of this chapter may not be made from an individual when, in the judgment of the Office, the individual is without fault and recovery would be against equity and good conscience. Withholding or recovery of money paid under subchapter II, IV, or V of this chapter on account of a certification or payment made by a former employee of the United States in the discharge of his official duties may be made only if the head of the agency on behalf of which the certification or payment was made certifies to the Office that the certification or payment involved fraud on the part of the former employee.</p>
