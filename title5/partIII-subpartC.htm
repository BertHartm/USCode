The exceptions for Production credit corporations and Federal intermediate credit banks in former section 2001(b)(5), (6) are omitted as they are no longer &ldquo;corporations wholly owned by the United States&rdquo;. Under the Farm Credit Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 659, the production credit corporations were merged in the Federal intermediate credit banks, and pursuant to that Act the Federal intermediate credit banks have ceased to be corporations owned by the United States.

<p class="note-body">Paragraph (2) is supplied because the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in section 2105 does not encompass individuals employed by the government of the District of Columbia.
