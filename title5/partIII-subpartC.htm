<p class="note-body">(b) The Department of Labor or other appropriate agency as determined by the Task Force shall, subject to the availability of appropriations:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) establish a specialized database for Federal training within the framework of the Department of Labor's ALX, or other appropriate information dissemination vehicles determined by the Task Force, to make information about Federal training courses, information, and other learning opportunities widely available to Federal employees;</p>
