<h4 class="note-head">Recognition</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. <em>Recognition in general</em>. (a) An agency shall accord exclusive recognition or national consultation rights at the request of a labor organization which meets the requirements for the recognition or consultation rights under this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) A labor organization seeking recognition shall submit to the agency a roster of its officers and representatives, a copy of its constitution and by-laws, and a statement of its objectives.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) When recognition of a labor organization has been accorded, the recognition continues as long as the organization continues to meet the requirements of this Order applicable to that recognition, except that this section does not require an election to determine whether an organization should become, or continue to be recognized as, exclusive representative of the employees in any unit or subdivision thereof within 12 <!-- PDFPage:552 -->months after a prior valid election with respect to such unit.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Recognition of a labor organization does not&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">(e) [Revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 11838, Feb. 6, 1975, 40 F.R. 5743.]</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Informal recognition or formal recognition shall not be accorded.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. [Revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 11616, Aug. 26, 1971, 36 F.R. 17319.]</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. <em>National consultation rights</em>. (a) An agency shall accord national consultation rights to a labor organization which qualifies under criteria established by the Federal Labor Relations Authority as the representative of a substantial number of employees of the agency. National consultation rights shall not be accorded for any unit where a labor organization already holds exclusive recognition at the national level for that unit. The granting of national consultation rights does not preclude an agency from appropriate dealings at the national level with other organizations on matters affecting their members. An agency shall terminate national consultation rights when the labor organization ceases to qualify under the established criteria.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) When a labor organization has been accorded national consultation rights, the agency, through appropriate officials, shall notify representatives of the organization of proposed substantive changes in personnel policies that affect employees it represents and provide an opportunity for the organization to comment on the proposed changes. The labor organization may suggest changes in the agency's personnel policies and have its views carefully considered. It may consult in person at reasonable times, on request, with appropriate officials on personnel policy matters, and at all times present its views thereon in writing. An agency is not required to consult with a labor organization on any matter on which it would not be required to meet and confer if the organization were entitled to exclusive recognition.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Questions as to the eligibility of labor organizations for national consultation rights may be referred to the Authority for decision.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. <em>Exclusive recognition</em>. (a) An agency shall accord exclusive recognition to a labor organization when the organization has been selected, in a secret ballot election, by a majority of the employees in an appropriate unit as their representative; provided that this section shall not preclude an agency from according exclusive recognition to a labor organization, without an election, where the appropriate unit is established through the consolidation of existing exclusively recognized units represented by that organization.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) A unit may be established on a plant or installation, craft, functional, or other basis which will ensure a clear and identifiable community of interest among the employees concerned and will promote effective dealings and efficiency of agency operations. A unit shall not be established solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized, nor shall a unit be established if it includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) any management official or supervisor, except as provided in section 24;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) an employee engaged in Federal personnel work in other than a purely clerical capacity; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) [Revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 11838, Feb. 6, 1975, 40 F.R. 5743.]</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) both professional and nonprofessional employees, unless a majority of the professional employees vote for inclusion in the unit. Questions as to the appropriate unit and related issues may be referred to the Authority for decision.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) [Revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 11838, Feb. 6, 1975, 40 F.R. 5743.]</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) All elections shall be conducted under the supervision of the Authority, or persons designated by it, and shall be by secret ballot. Each employee eligible to vote shall be provided the opportunity to choose the labor organization he wishes to represent him, from among those on the ballot, or &ldquo;no union&rdquo;, except as provided in subparagraph (4) of this paragraph. Elections may be held to determine whether&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) a labor organization should be recognized as the exclusive representative of employees in a unit;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) a labor organization should replace another labor organization as the exclusive representative;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) a labor organization should cease to be the exclusive representative; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) a labor organization should be recognized as the exclusive representative of employees in a unit composed of employees in units currently represented by that labor organization or continue to be recognized in the existing separate units.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) When a labor organization has been accorded exclusive recognition, it is the exclusive representative of employees in the unit and is entitled to act for and to negotiate agreements covering all employees in the unit. It is responsible for representing the interests of all employees in the unit without discrimination and without regard to labor organization membership. The labor organization shall be given the opportunity to be represented at formal discussions between management and employees or employee representatives concerning grievances, personnel policies and practices, or other matters affecting general working conditions of employees in the unit.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">Agreements</h4>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 11. <em>Negotiation of agreements</em>. (a) An agency and a labor organization that has been accorded exclusive recognition, through appropriate representatives, shall meet at reasonable times and confer in good faith with respect to personnel policies and practices and matters affecting working conditions, so far as may be appropriate under applicable laws and regulations, including policies set forth in the Federal Personnel Manual; published agency policies and regulations for which a compelling need exists under criteria established by the Federal Labor Relations Authority and which are issued at the agency headquarters level or at the level of a primary national subdivision; a national or other controlling agreement at a higher level in the agency; and this order. They may negotiate an agreement, or any question arising thereunder; determine appropriate techniques, consistent with section 17 of this order, to assist in such negotiation; and execute a written agreement or memorandum of understanding.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) In prescribing regulations relating to personnel policies and practices and working conditions, an agency shall have due regard for the obligation imposed by paragraph (a) of this section. However, the obligation to meet and confer does not include matters with respect to the mission of an agency; its budget; its organization; the number of employees; and the numbers, types, and grades of positions or employees assigned to an organizational unit, work project or tour of duty; the technology of performing its work; or its internal <!-- PDFPage:553 -->security practices. This does not preclude the parties from negotiating agreements providing appropriate arrangements for employees adversely affected by the impact of realignment of work forces or technological change.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) If, in connection with negotiations, an issue develops as to whether a proposal is contrary to law, regulation, controlling agreement, or this order and therefore not negotiable, it shall be resolved as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) An issue which involves interpretation of a controlling agreement at a higher agency level is resolved under the procedures of the controlling agreement, or, if none, under agency regulations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) An issue other than as described in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph which arises at a local level may be referred by either party to the head of the agency for determination;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) An agency head's determination as to the interpretation of the agency's regulations with respect to a proposal is final;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) A labor organization may appeal to the Authority for a decision when&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) it disagrees with an agency head's determination that a proposal would violate applicable law, regulation of appropriate authority outside the agency, or this order, or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) it believes that an agency's regulations, as interpreted by the agency head, violate applicable law, regulation of appropriate authority outside the agency, or this order, or are not otherwise applicable to bar negotiations under paragraph (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) [Revoked by Ex. Ord. No. 12107, Dec. 28, 1978, 44 F.R. 1055.]</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 12. <em>Basic provisions of agreements</em>. Each agreement between an agency and a labor organization is subject to the following requirements&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) in the administration of all matters covered by the agreement, officials and employees are governed by existing or future laws and the regulations of appropriate authorities, including policies set forth in the Federal Personnel Manual; by published agency policies and regulations in existence at the time the agreement was approved; and by subsequently published agency policies and regulations required by law or by the regulations of appropriate authorities, or authorized by the terms of a controlling agreement at a higher agency level;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) management officials of the agency retain the right, in accordance with applicable laws and regulations&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body">(1) to direct employees of the agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(2) to hire, promote, transfer, assign, and retain employees in positions within the agency, and to suspend, demote, discharge, or take other disciplinary action against employees;</p>
<p class="note-body">(3) to relieve employees from duties because of lack of work or for other legitimate reasons;</p>
<p class="note-body">(4) to maintain the efficiency of the Government operations entrusted to them;</p>
<p class="note-body">(5) to determine the methods, means, and personnel by which such operations are to be conducted; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(6) to take whatever actions may be necessary to carry out the mission of the agency in situations of emergency; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) nothing in the agreement shall require an employee to become or to remain a member of a labor organization, or to pay money to the organization except pursuant to a voluntary written authorization by a member for the payment of dues through payroll deductions. The requirements of this section shall be expressly stated in the initial or basic agreement and apply to all supplemental, implementing, subsidiary, or informal agreements between the agency and the organization.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 13. <em>Grievance and arbitration procedures</em>. (a) An agreement between an agency and a labor organization shall provide a procedure, applicable only to the unit, for the consideration of grievances.
