The terms &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; and &ldquo;military department&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;any executive department, independent commission, board, bureau, office, agency, or other establishment in the executive branch of the Government, including wholly owned Government corporations&rdquo; in view of the definitions in sections 105 and 102. The exception of &ldquo;a Government controlled corporation&rdquo; is added in subparagraph (i) to preserve the application of this subchapter to &ldquo;wholly owned Government corporations&rdquo;.</p>

<p class="note-body">Paragraph (5) is added for convenience and is based in part on former section 835(1)(A) and, insofar as concerns section 5703, on section 18 of the Act of Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 744, 60 Stat. 811.</p>
<p class="note-body">Paragraph (6), insofar as concerns section 5703, is based in part on section 18 of the Act of Aug. 2, 1946, ch. 744, 60 Stat. 811.</p>
<p class="note-body">The definition of &ldquo;Member of Congress&rdquo; in former section 835(4) is omitted as unnecessary in view of the definition of &ldquo;Member of Congress&rdquo; in section 2106.</p>
