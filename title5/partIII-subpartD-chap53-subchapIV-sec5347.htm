However, there shall not be more than two members from any one employee organization nor more than four members from a single council, federation, alliance, association, or affiliation of employee organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Every 2 years the Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall review employee organization representation to determine adequate or proportional representation under the guidelines of subsection (b) of this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) The Committee shall meet at the call of the Chairman. However, a special meeting shall be called by the Chairman if 5 members make a written request to the Chairman to call a special meeting to consider matters within the purview of the Committee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2), members of the Committee described in paragraphs (2)&ndash;(5) of subsection (a) of this section serve without additional pay.

<p class="statutory-body">(h) The Office of Personnel Management shall provide such clerical and professional personnel as the Chairman of the Committee considers appropriate and necessary to carry out its functions under this subchapter.
