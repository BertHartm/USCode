<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When the head of an agency or his designee determines that an employee, member of the Armed Forces or Reserve of the Armed <!-- PDFPage:408 -->Forces, is indebted to the United States for debts to which the United States is entitled to be repaid at the time of the determination by the head of an agency or his designee, or is notified of such a debt by the head of another agency or his designee the amount of indebtedness may be collected in monthly installments, or at officially established pay intervals, by deduction from the current pay account of the individual. The deductions may be made from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or, in the case of an individual not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay. The amount deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay, except that a greater percentage may be deducted upon the written consent of the individual involved. If the individual retires or resigns, or if his employment or period of active duty otherwise ends, before collection of the amount of the indebtedness is completed, deduction shall be made from subsequent payments of any nature due the individual from the agency concerned. All Federal agencies to which debts are owed and which have outstanding delinquent debts shall participate in a computer match at least annually of their delinquent debt records with records of Federal employees to identify those employees who are delinquent in repayment of those debts. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Matched Federal employee records shall include, but shall not be limited to, records of active Civil Service employees government-wide, military active duty personnel, military reservists, United States Postal Service employees, employees of other government corporations, and seasonal and temporary employees. The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish and maintain an interagency consortium to implement centralized salary offset computer matching, and promulgate regulations for this program. Agencies that perform centralized salary offset computer matching services under this subsection are authorized to charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost for such services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, prior to initiating any proceedings under paragraph (1) of this subsection to collect any indebtedness of an individual, the head of the agency holding the debt or his designee, shall provide the individual with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a minimum of thirty days written notice, informing such individual of the nature and amount of the indebtedness determined by such agency to be due, the intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the rights of the individual under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency, under terms agreeable to the head of the agency or his designee, to establish a schedule for the repayment of the debt; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) an opportunity for a hearing on the determination of the agency concerning the existence or the amount of the debt, and in the case of an individual whose repayment schedule is established other than by a written agreement pursuant to subparagraph (C), concerning the terms of the repayment schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A hearing, described in subparagraph (D), shall be provided if the individual, on or before the fifteenth day following receipt of the notice described in subparagraph (A), and in accordance with such procedures as the head of the agency may prescribe, files a petition requesting such a hearing. The timely filing of a petition for hearing shall stay the commencement of collection proceedings.

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section amends chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code, by inserting a new section 5534a. This section is based on subsections (a) and (f) of former 5 U.S.C. 61a&ndash;1 the source statute for which (act of Nov. 21, 1945, ch. 489, 59 Stat. 584) was repealed by the act of September 6, 1966, Public Law 89&ndash;554 (sec. 8, 80 Stat. 653). Senate Report 1380, 89th Congress, second session, pages 449, 511, explains that the source was repealed since it had been rendered obsolete by section 4(c) of the Armed Forces Leave Act of 1946, as amended (37 U.S.C. 501), and section 219(c) of the Public Health Service Act, as added August 9, 1950 (ch. 654, sec. 2, 64 Stat. 426; 42 U.S.C. 210&ndash;1(c)), and that any existing rights are preserved by section 8 of Public Law 89&ndash;554.</p>
<p class="note-body">At the time of enactment of the act of November 21, 1945, there was no authority to make lump-sum leave payments to members of the uniformed services who were being separated from or released from active duty in the uniformed services. Accordingly, they were placed on terminal leave until the expiration of the unused portion of their accumulated and current accrued leave, and only then separated or released. The act of November 21, 1945, in part, authorized the employment of these members during terminal leave and provided they were entitled to receive, in addition to the payment from the employment, military pay and allowances for the unexpired portion of the terminal leave. The Armed Forces Leave Act of 1946 authorized lump-sum leave payments of unused accumulated and current accrued leave. Generally, thereafter, members of the uniformed services were not placed on terminal leave, but were separated and paid a lump-sum leave payment. However, in certain instances a member may be placed on terminal leave. Such a case was considered recently by the Comptroller General of the United States (see B&ndash;157500, Oct. 13, 1965, 45 Comp. Gen. 180. In view of the foregoing, it is concluded that subsection (a) of former 5 U.S.C. 61a&ndash;1 had prospective effect and should have been reenacted in title 5, U.S.C., by Public Law 89&ndash;554.</p>
<p class="note-body">In section 5534a, the words &ldquo;A member of a uniformed service who has performed active service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Any person, who, shall have performed active service in the Armed Forces&rdquo; to conform to the style of title 5 and the definition of &ldquo;uniformed services&rdquo; in 5 U.S.C. 2101 which is coextensive with the definition of &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; in subsection (f) of former 5 U.S.C. 61a&ndash;1. Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965 (79 Stat. 1318), effective July 13, 1965, consolidated the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Weather Bureau to form a new agency in the Department of Commerce to be known as the Environmental Science Services Administration. The words &ldquo;subsequent to May 1, 1940&rdquo; are omitted as executed. The word &ldquo;territories&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Territories&rdquo; inasmuch as there now are no incorporated territories. The words &ldquo;(including any corporation created under authority of an act of Congress which is either wholly controlled or wholly owned by <!-- PDFPage:426 -->the Government of the United States, or any department, agency, or establishment thereof, whether or not the employees thereof are paid from funds appropriated by Congress)&rdquo; are omitted as included in &ldquo;a civilian office or position in the Government of the United States&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;pay&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;compensation.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5544. Wage-board overtime and Sunday rates; computation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An employee whose pay is fixed and adjusted from time to time in accordance with prevailing rates under section 5343 or 5349 of this title, or by a wage board or similar administrative authority serving the same purpose, is entitled to overtime pay for overtime work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week. However, an employee subject to this subsection who regularly is required to remain at or within the confines of his post of duty in excess of 8 hours a day in a standby or on-call status is entitled to overtime pay only for hours of duty, exclusive of eating and sleeping time, in excess of 40 a week. The overtime hourly rate of pay is computed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on a basis other than an annual or monthly basis, multiply the basic hourly rate of pay by not less than one and one-half.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on an annual basis, divide the basic annual rate of pay by 2,087, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on a monthly basis, multiply the basic monthly rate of pay by 12 to derive a basic annual rate of pay, divide the basic annual rate of pay by 2,087, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An employee subject to this subsection whose regular work schedule includes an 8-hour period of service a part of which is on Sunday is entitled to additional pay at the rate of 25 percent of his hourly rate of basic pay for each hour of work performed during that 8-hour period of service. For employees serving outside the United States in areas where Sunday is a routine workday and another day of the week is officially recognized as the day of rest and worship, the Secretary of State may designate the officially recognized day of rest and worship as the day with respect to which the preceding sentence shall apply instead of Sunday. Time spent in a travel status away from the official duty station of an employee subject to this subsection is not hours of work unless the travel (i) involves the performance of work while traveling, (ii) is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while traveling, (iii) is carried out under arduous conditions, or (iv) results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively. The first and third sentences of this subsection shall not be applicable to an employee who is subject to the overtime pay provisions of section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938. In the case of an employee who would, were it not for the preceding sentence, be subject to the first and third sentences of this subsection, the Office of Personnel Management shall by regulation prescribe what hours shall be deemed to be hours of work and what hours of work shall be deemed to be overtime hours for the purpose of such section 7 so as to ensure that no employee receives less pay by reason of the preceding sentence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An employee under the Office of the Architect of the Capitol who is paid on a daily or hourly basis and who is not subject to chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title is entitled to overtime pay for overtime work in accordance with subsection (a) of this section. The overtime hourly rate of pay is computed in accordance with subsection (a)(1) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The provisions of this section, including the last two sentences of subsection (a) and the provisions of section 5543(b), shall apply to a prevailing rate employee described in section 5342(a)(2)(B).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except as otherwise provided by subsection (c) of this section, an employee is entitled to pay for nightwork at his rate of basic pay plus premium pay amounting to 10 percent of that basic rate. This subsection and subsection (b) of this section do not modify section 5141 of title 31, or other statute authorizing additional pay for nightwork.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The head of an agency may designate a time after 6:00 p.m. and a time before 6:00 a.m. as the beginning and end, respectively, of nightwork for the purpose of subsection (a) of this section, at a post outside the United States where the customary hours of business extend into the hours of nightwork provided by subsection (a) of this section.</p>

Premium pay under this paragraph is determined as an appropriate percentage, not in excess of 25 percent, of such part of the rate of basic pay for the position as does not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS&ndash;10 (including any applicable locality-based comparability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law and any applicable special rate of pay under section 5305 or similar provision of law) (or, for a position described in section 5542(a)(3) of this title, of the basic pay of the position), by taking into consideration the number of hours of actual work required in the position, the number of hours required in a standby status at or within the confines of the station, the extent to which the duties of the position are made more onerous by night, Sunday, or holiday work, or by being extended over periods of more than 40 hours a week, and other relevant factors; or</p>

Premium pay under this paragraph is an appropriate percentage, not less than 10 percent nor more than 25 percent, of the rate of basic pay for the position, as determined by taking into consideration the frequency and duration of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty required in the position.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) This section applies to an employee whose position is classified in the firefighter occupation in conformance with the GS&ndash;081 standard published by the Office of Personnel Management, and whose normal work schedule, as in effect throughout the year, consists of regular tours of duty which average at least 106 hours per biweekly pay period.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If the regular tour of duty of a firefighter subject to this section generally consists of 24-hour shifts, rather than a basic 40-hour workweek (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management), section 5504(b) shall be applied as follows in computing pay&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) paragraph (1) of such section shall be deemed to require that the annual rate be divided by 2756 to derive the hourly rate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the computation of such firefighter's daily, weekly, or biweekly rate shall be based on the hourly rate under subparagraph (A);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of sections 5595(c), 5941, 8331(3), and 8704(c), and for such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe, the basic pay of a firefighter subject to this subsection shall include an amount equal to the firefighter's basic hourly rate (as computed under paragraph (1)(A)) for all hours in such firefighter's regular tour of duty (including overtime hours).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) If the regular tour of duty of a firefighter subject to this section includes a basic 40-hour workweek (as determined under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management), section 5504(b) shall be applied as follows in computing pay&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the provisions of such section shall apply to the hours within the basic 40-hour workweek;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) for hours outside the basic 40-hour workweek, such section shall be deemed to require that the hourly rate be derived by dividing the annual rate by 2756; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the computation of such firefighter's daily, weekly, or biweekly rate shall be based on subparagraphs (A) and (B), as each applies to the hours involved.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of sections 5595(c), 5941, 8331(3), and 8704(c), and for such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe, the basic pay of a firefighter subject to this subsection shall include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an amount computed under paragraph (1)(A) for the hours within the basic 40-hour workweek; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) A firefighter who is subject to this section shall receive overtime pay in accordance with section 5542, but shall not receive premium pay provided by other provisions of this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For the purpose of applying section 7(k) of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to a firefighter who is subject to this section, no violation referred to in such section 7(k) shall be deemed to have occurred if the requirements of section 5542(a) are met, applying section 5542(a) as provided in subsection (f) of that section: <em>Provided</em>, That the overtime hourly rate of pay for such firefighter shall in all cases be an amount equal to one and one-half times the firefighter's hourly rate of basic pay under subsection (b)(1)(A) or (c)(1)(B) of this section, as applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Office of Personnel Management may prescribe regulations, with respect to firefighters subject to this section, that would permit an agency to reduce or eliminate the variation in the amount of firefighters&rsquo; biweekly pay caused by work scheduling cycles that result in varying hours in the regular tours of duty from pay period to pay period. Under such regulations, the pay that a firefighter would otherwise receive for regular tours of duty over the work scheduling cycle shall, to the extent practicable, remain unaffected.</p>

<p class="note-body">In the codification of 5 U.S.C. 5547, the words &ldquo;premium pay under this subchapter&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;premium compensation provided by this Act&rdquo; appearing in the source statute&mdash;section 603 of the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1945, as amended (former 5 U.S.C. 943). This amendment of 5 U.S.C. 5547 is made for clarity and precision of reference and in recognition that the source statutes for certain sections of subchapter V of chapter 55 of title 5 include statutes that were not a part of the Federal Employees Pay Act of 1949. Specifically, 5 U.S.C. 5544(a) is based in part on section 23 (2d proviso) of the act of March 28, 1934, as amended by 76 Stat. 360; and 5 U.S.C. 5545(d) is based on section 804 of the Classification Act of 1949, as added by Public Law 89&ndash;512, 80 Stat. 318. Also, 5 U.S.C. 5541(2)(xi) in effect excludes employees subject to 5 U.S.C. 5544 from the operation of 5 U.S.C. 5547.</p>

The lump-sum payment shall equal the pay (excluding any differential under section 5925 and any allowance under section 5928) the employee or individual would have received had he remained in the service until expiration of the period of the annual or vacation leave. The lump-sum payment is considered pay for taxation purposes only. The period of leave used for calculating the lump-sum payment shall not be extended due to any holiday occurring after separation. For the purposes of this subsection, movement to employment described in section 2105(c) shall not be deemed separation from the service in the case of an employee whose annual leave is transferred under section 6308(b).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The accumulated and current accrued annual leave to which an officer excepted from subchapter I of chapter 63 of this title by section 6301(2)(x)&ndash;(xiii) of this title, is entitled immediately before the date he is excepted under that section shall be liquidated by a lump-sum payment in accordance with subsection (a) of this section or subchapter VIII of this chapter, except that the payment is based on the rate of pay which he was receiving, immediately before the date on which section 6301(2)(x)&ndash;(xiii) of this title became applicable to him.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Annual leave that is restored to an employee of the Department of Defense under section 6304(d) of this title by reason of the operation of paragraph (3) of such section and remains unused upon the transfer of the employee to a position described in paragraph (2) shall be liquidated by payment of a lump-sum for such leave to the employee upon the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A position referred to in paragraph (1) is a position in a department or agency of the Federal Government outside the Department of Defense or a Department of Defense position that is not located at a Department of Defense installation being closed or realigned as described in section 6304(d)(3) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) An allotment (including one for the purchase of United States savings bonds) made by an employee before he was in a missing status may be continued for the period he is in that status, notwithstanding the end of the period for which the allotment was made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In the absence of an allotment or when an allotment is insufficient for a purpose authorized by the head of the agency concerned, he or his designee may authorize such a new or increased allotment as circumstances warrant, which is payable for the period the employee concerned is in a missing status.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) When the head of the agency concerned officially reports that an employee in a missing status is alive, an allotment under subsections (a)&ndash;(d) of this section may be paid, subject to section 5562 of this title, until the date the head of the agency concerned receives evidence that the employee is dead or has returned to the controllable jurisdiction of the agency concerned.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) For the purpose of this section, &ldquo;household and personal effects&rdquo; and &ldquo;household effects&rdquo; may include, in addition to other authorized weight allowances, one privately owned motor vehicle which may be shipped at United States expense.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Transportation (including packing, crating, draying, temporarily storing, and unpacking of household and personal effects) may be provided for the dependents and household and personal effects of an employee in active service (without regard to pay grade) who is officially reported as dead, injured, or absent for more than 29 days in a status listed in section 5561(5) (A)&ndash;(E) of this title to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the official residence of record for the employee;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the residence of his dependent, next of kin, or other person entitled to the effects under regulations prescribed by the head of the agency concerned; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) another location determined in advance or later approved by the head of the agency concerned or his designee on request of the employee (if injured) or his dependent, next of kin, or other person described in paragraph (2) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When an employee described in subsection (b) of this section is in an injured status, transportation of dependents and household and personal effects may be provided under this section only when prolonged hospitalization or treatment is anticipated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Transportation on request of a dependent may be authorized under this section only when there is a reasonable relationship between the circumstances of the dependent and the destination requested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Instead of providing transportation for dependents under this section, when the travel has been completed the head of the agency concerned may authorize&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reimbursement for the commercial cost of the transportation; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a monetary allowance, instead of transportation, as authorized by statute for the whole or that part of the travel for which transportation in kind was not furnished.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f) The head of the agency concerned may store the household and personal effects of an employee described in subsection (b) of this section until proper disposition can be made. The cost of the storage and transportation (including packing, crating, draying, temporarily storing, and unpacking) of household and personal effects shall be charged against appropriations currently available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) When the head of the agency concerned determines that an emergency exists and that a sale would be in the best interests of the United States, he may provide for the public or private sale of motor vehicles and other bulky items of the household and personal effects of an employee described in subsection (b) of this section. Before a sale, and if practicable, a reasonable effort shall be made to determine the desires of interested persons. The net proceeds from the sale shall be sent to the owner or other person entitled thereto under regulations prescribed by the head of the agency concerned. If there is no owner or other person entitled thereto, or if the owner or other person or their addresses are not ascertained within 1 year from the date of sale, the net proceeds may be covered into the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A claim for net proceeds covered into the Treasury under subsection (g) of this section may be filed with the Administrator of General Services by the owner, his heir or next of kin, or his legal representative at any time before the end of 5 years from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury. When a claim is filed, the Administrator of General Services shall allow or disallow it. A claim that is allowed shall be paid from the appropriation for refunding money erroneously received and covered. If a claim is not filed before the end of 5 years from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury, it is barred from being acted on by the Administrator of General Services or the courts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) This section does not amend or repeal&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) When a finding of death is made under subsection (a) of this section, it shall include the date death is presumed to have occurred for the purpose of the ending of crediting pay and allowances and settlement of accounts. That date is&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the day after the day on which the 12 months in a missing status ends; or</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5566. Agency determinations</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may make any determination necessary to administer this subchapter, and when so made it is conclusive as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) death or finding of death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the fact of dependency under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any other status covered by this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an essential date, including one on which evidence or information is received by the head of the agency concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whether information received concerning an employee is to be construed and acted on as an official report of death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the head of the agency concerned receives information that he considers to conclusively establish the death of an employee, he shall take action thereon as an official report of death, notwithstanding an earlier action relating to death or status of the employee. After the end of 12 months in a missing status prescribed by section 5565 of this title, the head of the agency concerned or his designee shall make a finding of death when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that an employee in a missing status is dead.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may determine the entitlement of an employee to pay and allowances under this subchapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive. An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that an employee captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When circumstances warrant the reconsideration of a determination made under this subchapter, the head of the agency concerned or his designee may change or modify it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the account of an employee has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this subchapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the employee if the head of the agency concerned or his designee determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the employee was not a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from the pay and allowances of an employee for the period he is in a missing status may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when payment was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death. An allotment paid for a period after the end, under this subchapter or otherwise, of entitlement to pay and allowances may not be collected from the allottee or charged against the pay of a deceased employee when payment was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may waive the recovery of an erroneous payment or overpayment of an allotment to a dependent if he considers recovery is against equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) For the purpose of determining status under this section, a dependent of an employee in active service is deemed an employee. A determination under this section made by the head of the agency concerned or his designee is conclusive on all other agencies of the United States. This section does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.</p>
