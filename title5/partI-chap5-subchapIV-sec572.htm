<p class="statutory-body">(a) An agency may use a dispute resolution proceeding for the resolution of an issue in controversy that relates to an administrative program, if the parties agree to such proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) An agency shall consider not using a dispute resolution proceeding if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a definitive or authoritative resolution of the matter is required for precedential value, and such a proceeding is not likely to be accepted generally as an authoritative precedent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the matter involves or may bear upon significant questions of Government policy that require additional procedures before a final resolution may be made, and such a proceeding would not likely serve to develop a recommended policy for the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) maintaining established policies is of special importance, so that variations among individual decisions are not increased and such a proceeding would not likely reach consistent results among individual decisions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the matter significantly affects persons or organizations who are not parties to the proceeding;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) a full public record of the proceeding is important, and a dispute resolution proceeding cannot provide such a record; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the agency must maintain continuing jurisdiction over the matter with authority to alter the disposition of the matter in the light of changed circumstances, and a dispute resolution proceeding would interfere with the agency's fulfilling that requirement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Alternative means of dispute resolution authorized under this subchapter are voluntary procedures which supplement rather than limit other available agency dispute resolution techniques.</p>
