<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) For purposes of any computation under this section, an employee shall, with respect to the period referred to in subsection (b)(2)(B), be considered to have been paid at the rate which would have been payable over such period had such employee remained continuously employed in the position which such employee last held before separating or entering leave-without-pay status to perform military service.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) An employee to whom this section applies may elect, for purposes of section 8433(d), or paragraph (1) or (2) of section 8433(h),<sup><a href="#8432b_1_target" name="8432b_1">1</a></sup> as the case may be, to have such employee's separation (described in subsection (a)(1)) treated as if it had never occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An election under this paragraph shall be made within such period of time after restoration or reemployment (as the case may be) and otherwise in such manner as the Executive Director prescribes.</p>
