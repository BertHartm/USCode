<p class="statutory-body">(h) A member of the uniformed service on a permanent change of duty station or temporary duty orders and occupying unaccompanied personnel housing&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is exempt from the requirement of subsection (c) to pay a rental rate or charge based on the reasonable value of the quarters and facilities provided; and</p>
