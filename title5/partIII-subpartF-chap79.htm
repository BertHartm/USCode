<h4 class="analysis-subhead">1&ndash;1. <cap-smallcap>Scope of this Order</cap-smallcap></h4>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;101. This order applies to all agencies of the Executive Branch except military personnel and uniquely military equipment, systems, and operations.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;102. For the purposes of this order, the term &ldquo;agency&rdquo; means an Executive department, as defined in 5 U.S.C. 101, or any employing unit or authority of the Federal government, other than those of the judicial and legislative branches. Since section 19 [29 U.S.C. 668] of the Occupational Safety and Health Act (&ldquo;the Act&rdquo;) [29 U.S.C. 651 et seq.] covers all Federal employees, however, the Secretary of Labor (&ldquo;the Secretary&rdquo;) shall cooperate and consult with the heads of agencies in the legislative and judicial branches of the government to help them adopt safety and health programs.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">1&ndash;2. <cap-smallcap>Heads of Agencies</cap-smallcap></h4>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;201. The head of each agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Furnish to employees places and conditions of employment that are free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or serious physical harm.</p>

<p class="note-body">(d) Comply with all standards issued under section 6 of the Act [29 U.S.C. 655], except where the Secretary approves compliance with alternative standards.

<p class="note-body">(e) Assure prompt abatement of unsafe or unhealthy working conditions. Whenever an agency cannot promptly abate such conditions, it shall develop an abatement plan setting forth a timetable for abatement and a summary of interim steps to protect employees. Employees exposed to the conditions shall be informed of the provisions of the plan. When a hazard cannot be abated without assistance of the General Services Administration or other Federal lessor agency, an agency shall act with the lessor agency to secure abatement.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Establish procedures to assure that no employee is subject to restraint, interference, coercion, discrimination or reprisal for filing a report of an unsafe or unhealthy working condition, or other participation in agency occupational safety and health program activities.</p>
<p class="note-body">(g) Assure that periodic inspections of all agency workplaces are performed by personnel with equipment and competence to recognize hazards.</p>
<p class="note-body">(h) Assure response to employee reports of hazardous conditions and require inspections within twenty-four hours for imminent dangers, three working days for potential serious conditions, and twenty working days for other conditions.

<p class="note-body">(j) Operate an occupational safety and health management information system, which shall include the maintenance of such records as the Secretary may require.</p>
<p class="note-body">(k) Provide safety and health training for supervisory employees, employees responsible for conducting occupational safety and health inspections, all members of occupational safety and health committees where established, and other employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">(<em>l</em>) Submit to the Secretary an annual report on the agency occupational safety and health program that includes information the Secretary prescribes.</p>
<h4 class="analysis-subhead">1&ndash;3. <cap-smallcap>Occupational Safety and Health Committees</cap-smallcap></h4>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;301. Agency heads may establish occupational safety and health committees. If committees are established, they shall be established at both the national level and, for agencies with field or regional offices, other appropriate levels. The committees shall be composed of representatives of management and an equal number of nonmanagement employees or their representatives. Where there are exclusive bargaining representatives for employees at the national or other level in an agency, such representatives shall select the appropriate nonmanagement members of the committee.</p>
<p class="note-body">1&ndash;302. The committees shall, except where prohibited by law,</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) Have access to agency information relevant to their duties, including information on the nature and hazardousness of substances in agency workplaces.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) Monitor performance, including agency inspections, of the agency safety and health programs at the level they are established.</p>

<p class="note-body">(c) Issue, subject to the approval of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, and in consultation with the Federal Advisory Council on Occupational Safety and Health, a set of basic program elements. The program elements shall help agency heads establish occupational safety and health committees and operate effective occupational safety and health programs, and shall provide flexibility to each agency head to implement a program consistent with its mission, size and organization. Upon request of an agency head, and after consultation with the Federal Advisory Council on Occupational Safety and Health, the Secretary may approve alternate program elements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) Prescribe recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) Assist agencies by providing training materials, and by conducting training programs upon request and with reimbursement.</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) Facilitate the exchange of ideas and information throughout the government about occupational safety and health.</p>

The evaluations shall be conducted through such scheduled headquarters or field reviews, studies or inspections as the Secretary deems necessary, at least annually for the larger or more hazardous agencies or operations, and as the Secretary deems appropriate for the smaller or less hazardous agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Conduct unannounced inspections of agency workplaces when the Secretary determines necessary if an agency does not have occupational safety and health committees; or in response to reports of unsafe or unhealthful working conditions, upon request of occupational safety and health committees under Section 1&ndash;3; or, in the case of a report of an imminent danger, when such a committee has not responded to an employee who has alleged to it that the agency has not adequately responded to a report as required in 1&ndash;201(h). When the Secretary or his designee performs an inspection and discovers unsafe or unhealthy conditions, a violation of any provisions of this order, or any safety or health standards adopted by an agency pursuant to this order, or any program element approved by the Secretary, he shall promptly issue a report to the head of the agency and to the appropriate occupational safety and health committee, if any. The report shall describe the nature of the findings and may make recommendations for correcting the violation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(j) Submit to the President each year a summary report of the status of the occupational safety and health of Federal employees, and, together with agency responses, evaluations of individual agency progress and problems in correcting unsafe and unhealthful working conditions, and recommendations for improving their performance.</p>
