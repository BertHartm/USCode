<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Congress further finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the need for many existing advisory committees has not been adequately reviewed:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) new advisory committees should be established only when they are determined to be essential and their number should be kept to the minimum necessary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) advisory committees should be terminated when they are no longer carrying out the purposes for which they were established;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) standards and uniform procedures should govern the establishment, operation, administration, and duration of advisory committees;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the Congress and the public should be kept informed with respect to the number, purpose, membership, activities, and cost of advisory committees; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the function of advisory committees should be advisory only, and that all matters under their consideration should be determined, in accordance with law, by the official, agency, or officer involved.</p>
