<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1), the sentence &ldquo;Nothing in this Act shall be construed to repeal delegations of authority as provided by law,&rdquo; is omitted as surplusage since there is nothing in the Act which could reasonably be so construed.</p>

<p class="note-body">In paragraph (1)(H), the words &ldquo;functions which by law expire on the termination of present hostilities, within any fixed period thereafter, or before July 1, 1947&rdquo; are omitted as executed.

L. 87&ndash;256, 75 Stat. 538, since &sect;111(c) of the Act provides that a reference in other Acts to a provision of law repealed by &sect;111(a) shall be considered to be a reference to the appropriate provisions of Pub. L. 87&ndash;256.</p>

<p class="note-body">In paragraph (3), the words &ldquo;and a person or agency admitted by an agency as a party for limited purposes&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;but nothing herein shall be construed to prevent an agency from admitting any person or agency as a party for limited purposes&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (9), a comma is supplied between the words &ldquo;limitation&rdquo; and &ldquo;amendment&rdquo; to correct an editorial error of omission.</p>
