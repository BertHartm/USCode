<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) An agreement between any agency and an exclusive representative shall be subject to approval by the head of the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of the agency shall approve the agreement within 30 days from the date the agreement is executed if the agreement is in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and any other applicable law, rule, or regulation (unless the agency has granted an exception to the provision).</p>
