<p class="note-body">Subsection (b) of 5 U.S.C. 5726 was derived from subsection (e) of section 1 of the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946, as amended (74 Stat. 796). In the codification of subsection (e), the words &ldquo;7,000 pounds net weight&rdquo; were substituted for &ldquo;the maximum weight limitation provided by subsection (a)&rdquo;. During the pendency of the codification bill, section 1(a)(2) of Public Law 89&ndash;516, amended subsection (a) of section 1 of the Administrative Expenses Act of 1946 to increase the maximum weight limitation from 7,000 to 11,000 pounds.

The words &ldquo;continental United States&rdquo; are coextensive with and substituted for &ldquo;continental United States, excluding Alaska&rdquo; on authority of the definition of &ldquo;continental United States&rdquo; in 5 U.S.C. 5721(3). The words &ldquo;head of the agency concerned&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;head of the Executive Department or agency concerned&rdquo; to conform to the definition in 5 U.S.C. 5721(1). In the penultimate sentence, the words &ldquo;sections 5723(a) and 5724(a) of this title&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;section 1 or 7(b) of this Act&rdquo; to reflect the codification of sections 1 and 7(b) in 5 U.S.C. 5723(a) and 5724(a); and the word &ldquo;officer&rdquo; is omitted as included in &ldquo;employee&rdquo;. In the last sentence, the words &ldquo;under this subsection&rdquo; are inserted for clarity.</p>
