<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Effective as of the first day of the first applicable pay period beginning on or after January 1 of each calendar year, the rates of basic pay for each statutory pay system shall be increased by the percentage (rounded to the nearest one-tenth of 1 percent) equal to one-half of 1 percentage point less than the percentage by which the ECI for the base quarter of the year before the preceding calendar year exceeds the ECI for the base quarter of the second year before the preceding calendar year (if at all).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) If, because of national emergency or serious economic conditions affecting the general <!-- PDFPage:331 -->welfare, the President should consider the pay adjustment which would otherwise be required by subsection (a) in any year to be inappropriate, the President shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) prepare and transmit to Congress before September 1 of the preceding calendar year a plan for such alternative pay adjustments as he considers appropriate, together with the reasons therefor; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) adjust the rates of pay of each statutory pay system, in accordance with such plan, effective on the same day as the increase under subsection (a) would otherwise take effect.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In evaluating an economic condition affecting the general welfare under this subsection, the President shall consider pertinent economic measures including, but not limited to, the Indexes of Leading Economic Indicators, the Gross National Product, the unemployment rate, the budget deficit, the Consumer Price Index, the Producer Price Index, the Employment Cost Index, and the Implicit Price Deflator for Personal Consumption Expenditures.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The President shall include in the report to Congress under paragraph (1)(A) his assessment of the impact that the alternative pay adjustments under this subsection will have on the Government's ability to recruit and retain well-qualified employees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The rates of basic pay that take effect under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) shall modify, supersede, or render inapplicable, as the case may be, to the extent inconsistent therewith, any prior rates of basic pay under the statutory pay system involved (as last adjusted under this section or prior provisions of law); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) shall be printed in the Federal Register and the Code of Federal Regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) An increase in rates of basic pay that takes effect under this section is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of section 5335.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) This section does not impair any authority pursuant to which rates of basic pay may be fixed by administrative action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Pay may not be paid, by reason of any provision of this section (disregarding any comparability payment payable), at a rate in excess of the rate of basic pay payable for level V of the Executive Schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) Any rate of pay under this section shall be initially adjusted, effective on the effective date of the rate of pay, under conversion rules prescribed by the President or by such agency or agencies as the President may designate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Pay disparities shall be identified and reduced as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Comparability payments shall be payable within each locality determined to have a pay disparity greater than 5 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) The localities having pay disparities, and the size of those disparities, shall, for purposes of any comparability payment scheduled to take effect in any calendar year, be determined in accordance with the appropriate report, as prepared and submitted to the President under subsection (d)(1) for purposes of such calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any computation necessary to determine the size of the comparability payment to become payable for any locality in a year (as well as any determination as to the size of any pay disparity remaining after that comparability payment is made) shall likewise be made using data contained in the appropriate report (described in subparagraph (A)) so prepared and submitted for purposes of such calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Subject to paragraph (4), the amount of the comparability payments payable under this subsection in a calendar year within any locality in which a comparability payment is payable shall be computed using such percentage as the President determines for such locality under subsection (d)(2), except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage for the first calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 1/5 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the percentage for the second calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 3/10 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the percentage for the third calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 2/5 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the percentage for the fourth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 1/2 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the percentage for the fifth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 3/5 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the percentage for the sixth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 7/10 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:337 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the percentage for the seventh calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 4/5 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the percentage for the eighth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 9/10 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the percentage for the ninth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section, and any year thereafter, may not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nothing in this section shall be considered to preclude the President, in his discretion, from adjusting comparability payments to a level higher than the minimum level otherwise required in a calendar year, including to the level necessary to eliminate a locality's pay disparity completely.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) After the ninth calendar year (referred to in subsection (a)(3)(I)), the level of comparability payments payable within such locality may be reduced for any subsequent calendar year, but only if, or to the extent that, the reduction would not immediately create another pay disparity in excess of 5 percent within the locality (taking into consideration any comparability payments remaining payable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The amount of the comparability payment payable within any particular locality during a calendar year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be stated as a single percentage, which shall be uniformly applicable to General Schedule positions within the locality; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall, for any employee entitled to receive a comparability payment, be computed by applying that percentage to such employee's scheduled rate of basic pay (or, if lower due to a limitation on the rate payable, the rate actually payable), subject to subsection (g).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A comparability payment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be considered to be part of basic pay for purposes of retirement under chapter 83 or 84, as applicable, life insurance under chapter 87, and premium pay under subchapter V of chapter 55, and for such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be paid in the same manner and at the same time as the basic pay payable to such employee pursuant to any provision of law outside of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subchapter shall be considered to permit or require that any portion of a comparability payment be taken into account for purposes of any adjustment under section 5303.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Only employees receiving scheduled rates of basic pay (subject to any pay limitation which may apply) shall be eligible for comparability payments under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Comparability payments shall not be payable for service performed in any position which may not, under subsection (f)(1)(A), be included within a pay locality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In order to carry out this section, the President shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) direct such agent as he considers appropriate to prepare and submit to him annually, after considering such views and recommendations as may be submitted under subsection (e) (but not later than 13 months before the start of the calendar year for purposes of which it is prepared), a report that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) includes the views and recommendations submitted under subsection (e);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) after considering the report of his agent (including the views and recommendations referred to in subsection (e)(2)(C), provide for or adjust comparability payments in conformance with applicable requirements of this section, effective as of the beginning of the first applicable pay period commencing on or after January 1 of the applicable year; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) identify each pay locality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) specify which localities have pay disparities in excess of 5 percent, and the size of the disparity existing in each of those localities, according to the pay agent's most recent report under paragraph (1) (before and after taking into consideration any comparability payments payable); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) indicate the size of the respective comparability payments (expressed as percentages) which will be in effect under paragraph (2) for the various pay localities specified under subparagraph (B) for the applicable calendar year.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 6 shall be representatives of employee organizations which represent substantial numbers of employees holding General Schedule <!-- PDFPage:338 -->positions, and who shall be selected giving due consideration to such factors as the relative numbers of employees represented by the various organizations, except that not more than 3 members of the Council at any one time shall be from a single employee organization, council, federation, alliance, association, or affiliation of employee organizations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Members of the Council shall not receive pay by reason of their service on the Council, nor shall members who are not otherwise employees of the United States be considered employees by reason of any such service.
