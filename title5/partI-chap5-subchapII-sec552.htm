<p class="statutory-body">(a) Each agency shall make available to the public information as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each agency shall separately state and currently publish in the Federal Register for the guidance of the public&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) descriptions of its central and field organization and the established places at which, the employees (and in the case of a uniformed service, the members) from whom, and the methods whereby, the public may obtain information, make submittals or requests, or obtain decisions;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) statements of the general course and method by which its functions are channeled and determined, including the nature and requirements of all formal and informal procedures available;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) rules of procedure, descriptions of forms available or the places at which forms may be obtained, and instructions as to the scope and contents of all papers, reports, or examinations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) substantive rules of general applicability adopted as authorized by law, and statements of general policy or interpretations of general applicability formulated and adopted by the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) each amendment, revision, or repeal of the foregoing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except to the extent that a person has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof, a person may not in any manner be required to resort to, or be adversely affected by, a matter required to be published in the Federal Register and not so published. For the purpose of this paragraph, matter reasonably available to the class of persons affected thereby is deemed published in the Federal Register when incorporated by reference therein with the approval of the Director of the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Each agency, in accordance with published rules, shall make available for public inspection and copying&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) final opinions, including concurring and dissenting opinions, as well as orders, made in the adjudication of cases;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) those statements of policy and interpretations which have been adopted by the agency and are not published in the Federal Register;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) administrative staff manuals and instructions to staff that affect a member of the public;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) copies of all records, regardless of form or format, which have been released to any person under paragraph (3) and which, because of the nature of their subject matter, the agency determines have become or are likely to become the subject of subsequent requests for substantially the same records; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) a general index of the records referred to under subparagraph (D);</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless the materials are promptly published and copies offered for sale. For records created on or <!-- PDFPage:25 -->after November 1, 1996, within one year after such date, each agency shall make such records available, including by computer telecommunications or, if computer telecommunications means have not been established by the agency, by other electronic means. To the extent required to prevent a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, an agency may delete identifying details when it makes available or publishes an opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, staff manual, instruction, or copies of records referred to in subparagraph (D). However, in each case the justification for the deletion shall be explained fully in writing, and the extent of such deletion shall be indicated on the portion of the record which is made available or published, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in subsection (b) under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the extent of the deletion shall be indicated at the place in the record where the deletion was made. Each agency shall also maintain and make available for public inspection and copying current indexes providing identifying information for the public as to any matter issued, adopted, or promulgated after July 4, 1967, and required by this paragraph to be made available or published. Each agency shall promptly publish, quarterly or more frequently, and distribute (by sale or otherwise) copies of each index or supplements thereto unless it determines by order published in the Federal Register that the publication would be unnecessary and impracticable, in which case the agency shall nonetheless provide copies of such index on request at a cost not to exceed the direct cost of duplication. Each agency shall make the index referred to in subparagraph (E) available by computer telecommunications by December 31, 1999. A final order, opinion, statement of policy, interpretation, or staff manual or instruction that affects a member of the public may be relied on, used, or cited as precedent by an agency against a party other than an agency only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) it has been indexed and either made available or published as provided by this paragraph; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the party has actual and timely notice of the terms thereof.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Except with respect to the records made available under paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection, and except as provided in subparagraph (E), each agency, upon any request for records which (i) reasonably describes such records and (ii) is made in accordance with published rules stating the time, place, fees (if any), and procedures to be followed, shall make the records promptly available to any person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In making any record available to a person under this paragraph, an agency shall provide the record in any form or format requested by the person if the record is readily reproducible by the agency in that form or format. Each agency shall make reasonable efforts to maintain its records in forms or formats that are reproducible for purposes of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) In responding under this paragraph to a request for records, an agency shall make reasonable efforts to search for the records in electronic form or format, except when such efforts would significantly interfere with the operation of the agency's automated information system.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;search&rdquo; means to review, manually or by automated means, agency records for the purpose of locating those records which are responsive to a request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) An agency, or part of an agency, that is an element of the intelligence community (as that term is defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4))) shall not make any record available under this paragraph to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) any government entity, other than a State, territory, commonwealth, or district of the United States, or any subdivision thereof; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) a representative of a government entity described in clause (i).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A)(i) In order to carry out the provisions of this section, each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, specifying the schedule of fees applicable to the processing of requests under this section and establishing procedures and guidelines for determining when such fees should be waived or reduced. Such schedule shall conform to the guidelines which shall be promulgated, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget and which shall provide for a uniform schedule of fees for all agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Such agency regulations shall provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search, duplication, and review, when records are requested for commercial use;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document duplication when records are not sought for commercial use and the request is made by an educational or noncommercial scientific institution, whose purpose is scholarly or scientific research; or a representative of the news media; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) for any request not described in (I) or (II), fees shall be limited to reasonable standard charges for document search and duplication.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In this clause, the term &ldquo;a representative of the news media&rdquo; means any person or entity that gathers information of potential interest to a segment of the public, uses its editorial skills to turn the raw materials into a distinct work, and distributes that work to an audience. In this clause, the term &ldquo;news&rdquo; means information that is about current events or that would be of current interest to the public. Examples of news-media entities are television or radio stations broadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (but only if such entities qualify as disseminators of &ldquo;news&rdquo;) who make their products available for purchase by or subscription by or free distribution to the general public. These examples are not all-inclusive. Moreover, as methods of news delivery evolve (for example, the adoption of the electronic dissemination of newspapers through telecommunications services), such alternative media shall be considered to be news-media entities. A freelance <!-- PDFPage:26 -->journalist shall be regarded as working for a news-media entity if the journalist can demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication through that entity, whether or not the journalist is actually employed by the entity. A publication contract would present a solid basis for such an expectation; the Government may also consider the past publication record of the requester in making such a determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Documents shall be furnished without any charge or at a charge reduced below the fees established under clause (ii) if disclosure of the information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Fee schedules shall provide for the recovery of only the direct costs of search, duplication, or review. Review costs shall include only the direct costs incurred during the initial examination of a document for the purposes of determining whether the documents must be disclosed under this section and for the purposes of withholding any portions exempt from disclosure under this section. Review costs may not include any costs incurred in resolving issues of law or policy that may be raised in the course of processing a request under this section. No fee may be charged by any agency under this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) if the costs of routine collection and processing of the fee are likely to equal or exceed the amount of the fee; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) for any request described in clause (ii) (II) or (III) of this subparagraph for the first two hours of search time or for the first one hundred pages of duplication.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(v) No agency may require advance payment of any fee unless the requester has previously failed to pay fees in a timely fashion, or the agency has determined that the fee will exceed $250.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) Nothing in this subparagraph shall supersede fees chargeable under a statute specifically providing for setting the level of fees for particular types of records.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(vii) In any action by a requester regarding the waiver of fees under this section, the court shall determine the matter de novo: <em>Provided</em>, That the court's review of the matter shall be limited to the record before the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(viii) An agency shall not assess search fees (or in the case of a requester described under clause (ii)(II), duplication fees) under this subparagraph if the agency fails to comply with any time limit under paragraph (6), if no unusual or exceptional circumstances (as those terms are defined for purposes of paragraphs (6)(B) and (C), respectively) apply to the processing of the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) On complaint, the district court of the United States in the district in which the complainant resides, or has his principal place of business, or in which the agency records are situated, or in the District of Columbia, has jurisdiction to enjoin the agency from withholding agency records and to order the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant. In such a case the court shall determine the matter de novo, and may examine the contents of such agency records in camera to determine whether such records or any part thereof shall be withheld under any of the exemptions set forth in subsection (b) of this section, and the burden is on the agency to sustain its action. In addition to any other matters to which a court accords substantial weight, a court shall accord substantial weight to an affidavit of an agency concerning the agency's determination as to technical feasibility under paragraph (2)(C) and subsection (b) and reproducibility under paragraph (3)(B).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the defendant shall serve an answer or otherwise plead to any complaint made under this subsection within thirty days after service upon the defendant of the pleading in which such complaint is made, unless the court otherwise directs for good cause shown.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">[(D) Repealed. Pub. L. 98&ndash;620, title IV, &sect;402(2), Nov. 8, 1984, 98 Stat. 3357.]</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) The court may assess against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs reasonably incurred in any case under this section in which the complainant has substantially prevailed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, a complainant has substantially prevailed if the complainant has obtained relief through either&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) a judicial order, or an enforceable written agreement or consent decree; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) a voluntary or unilateral change in position by the agency, if the complainant's claim is not insubstantial.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(F)(i) Whenever the court orders the production of any agency records improperly withheld from the complainant and assesses against the United States reasonable attorney fees and other litigation costs, and the court additionally issues a written finding that the circumstances surrounding the withholding raise questions whether agency personnel acted arbitrarily or capriciously with respect to the withholding, the Special Counsel shall promptly initiate a proceeding to determine whether disciplinary action is warranted against the officer or employee who was primarily responsible for the withholding. The Special Counsel, after investigation and consideration of the evidence submitted, shall submit his findings and recommendations to the administrative authority of the agency concerned and shall send copies of the findings and recommendations to the officer or employee or his representative. The administrative authority shall take the corrective action that the Special Counsel recommends.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) The Attorney General shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) notify the Special Counsel of each civil action described under the first sentence of clause (i); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) annually submit a report to Congress on the number of such civil actions in the preceding year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) The Special Counsel shall annually submit a report to Congress on the actions taken by the Special Counsel under clause (i).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(G) In the event of noncompliance with the order of the court, the district court may punish for contempt the responsible employee, and in the case of a uniformed service, the responsible member.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:27 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) Each agency having more than one member shall maintain and make available for public inspection a record of the final votes of each member in every agency proceeding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) Each agency, upon any request for records made under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection, shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) determine within 20 days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of any such request whether to comply with such request and shall immediately notify the person making such request of such determination and the reasons therefor, and of the right of such person to appeal to the head of the agency any adverse determination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) make a determination with respect to any appeal within twenty days (excepting Saturdays, Sundays, and legal public holidays) after the receipt of such appeal. If on appeal the denial of the request for records is in whole or in part upheld, the agency shall notify the person making such request of the provisions for judicial review of that determination under paragraph (4) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The 20-day period under clause (i) shall commence on the date on which the request is first received by the appropriate component of the agency, but in any event not later than ten days after the request is first received by any component of the agency that is designated in the agency's regulations under this section to receive requests under this section. The 20-day period shall not be tolled by the agency except&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) that the agency may make one request to the requester for information and toll the 20-day period while it is awaiting such information that it has reasonably requested from the requester under this section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) if necessary to clarify with the requester issues regarding fee assessment. In either case, the agency's receipt of the requester's response to the agency's request for information or clarification ends the tolling period.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) In unusual circumstances as specified in this subparagraph, the time limits prescribed in either clause (i) or clause (ii) of subparagraph (A) may be extended by written notice to the person making such request setting forth the unusual circumstances for such extension and the date on which a determination is expected to be dispatched. No such notice shall specify a date that would result in an extension for more than ten working days, except as provided in clause (ii) of this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) With respect to a request for which a written notice under clause (i) extends the time limits prescribed under clause (i) of subparagraph (A), the agency shall notify the person making the request if the request cannot be processed within the time limit specified in that clause and shall provide the person an opportunity to limit the scope of the request so that it may be processed within that time limit or an opportunity to arrange with the agency an alternative time frame for processing the request or a modified request. To aid the requester, each agency shall make available its FOIA Public Liaison, who shall assist in the resolution of any disputes between the requester and the agency. Refusal by the person to reasonably modify the request or arrange such an alternative time frame shall be considered as a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist for purposes of subparagraph (C).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) As used in this subparagraph, &ldquo;unusual circumstances&rdquo; means, but only to the extent reasonably necessary to the proper processing of the particular requests&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) the need to search for and collect the requested records from field facilities or other establishments that are separate from the office processing the request;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) the need to search for, collect, and appropriately examine a voluminous amount of separate and distinct records which are demanded in a single request; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(III) the need for consultation, which shall be conducted with all practicable speed, with another agency having a substantial interest in the determination of the request or among two or more components of the agency having substantial subject-matter interest therein.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) Each agency may promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, providing for the aggregation of certain requests by the same requestor, or by a group of requestors acting in concert, if the agency reasonably believes that such requests actually constitute a single request, which would otherwise satisfy the unusual circumstances specified in this subparagraph, and the requests involve clearly related matters. Multiple requests involving unrelated matters shall not be aggregated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C)(i) Any person making a request to any agency for records under paragraph (1), (2), or (3) of this subsection shall be deemed to have exhausted his administrative remedies with respect to such request if the agency fails to comply with the applicable time limit provisions of this paragraph. If the Government can show exceptional circumstances exist and that the agency is exercising due diligence in responding to the request, the court may retain jurisdiction and allow the agency additional time to complete its review of the records. Upon any determination by an agency to comply with a request for records, the records shall be made promptly available to such person making such request. Any notification of denial of any request for records under this subsection shall set forth the names and titles or positions of each person responsible for the denial of such request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;exceptional circumstances&rdquo; does not include a delay that results from a predictable agency workload of requests under this section, unless the agency demonstrates reasonable progress in reducing its backlog of pending requests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) Refusal by a person to reasonably modify the scope of a request or arrange an alternative time frame for processing a request (or a modified request) under clause (ii) after being given an opportunity to do so by the agency to whom the person made the request shall be considered as a factor in determining whether exceptional circumstances exist for purposes of this subparagraph.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:28 --><p class="statutory-body">(D)(i) Each agency may promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, providing for multitrack processing of requests for records based on the amount of work or time (or both) involved in processing requests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Regulations under this subparagraph may provide a person making a request that does not qualify for the fastest multitrack processing an opportunity to limit the scope of the request in order to qualify for faster processing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) This subparagraph shall not be considered to affect the requirement under subparagraph (C) to exercise due diligence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E)(i) Each agency shall promulgate regulations, pursuant to notice and receipt of public comment, providing for expedited processing of requests for records&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) in cases in which the person requesting the records demonstrates a compelling need; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) in other cases determined by the agency.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Notwithstanding clause (i), regulations under this subparagraph must ensure&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) that a determination of whether to provide expedited processing shall be made, and notice of the determination shall be provided to the person making the request, within 10 days after the date of the request; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) expeditious consideration of administrative appeals of such determinations of whether to provide expedited processing.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(iii) An agency shall process as soon as practicable any request for records to which the agency has granted expedited processing under this subparagraph. Agency action to deny or affirm denial of a request for expedited processing pursuant to this subparagraph, and failure by an agency to respond in a timely manner to such a request shall be subject to judicial review under paragraph (4), except that the judicial review shall be based on the record before the agency at the time of the determination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(iv) A district court of the United States shall not have jurisdiction to review an agency denial of expedited processing of a request for records after the agency has provided a complete response to the request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(v) For purposes of this subparagraph, the term &ldquo;compelling need&rdquo; means&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) that a failure to obtain requested records on an expedited basis under this paragraph could reasonably be expected to pose an imminent threat to the life or physical safety of an individual; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(II) with respect to a request made by a person primarily engaged in disseminating information, urgency to inform the public concerning actual or alleged Federal Government activity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(vi) A demonstration of a compelling need by a person making a request for expedited processing shall be made by a statement certified by such person to be true and correct to the best of such person's knowledge and belief.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(F) In denying a request for records, in whole or in part, an agency shall make a reasonable effort to estimate the volume of any requested matter the provision of which is denied, and shall provide any such estimate to the person making the request, unless providing such estimate would harm an interest protected by the exemption in subsection (b) pursuant to which the denial is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Each agency shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish a system to assign an individualized tracking number for each request received that will take longer than ten days to process and provide to each person making a request the tracking number assigned to the request; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) establish a telephone line or Internet service that provides information about the status of a request to the person making the request using the assigned tracking number, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) the date on which the agency originally received the request; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) an estimated date on which the agency will complete action on the request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) This section does not apply to matters that are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1)(A) specifically authorized under criteria established by an Executive order to be kept secret in the interest of national defense or foreign policy and (B) are in fact properly classified pursuant to such Executive order;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) related solely to the internal personnel rules and practices of an agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) specifically exempted from disclosure by statute (other than section 552b of this title), provided that such statute (A) requires that the matters be withheld from the public in such a manner as to leave no discretion on the issue, or (B) establishes particular criteria for withholding or refers to particular types of matters to be withheld;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters which would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) personnel and medical files and similar files the disclosure of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes, but only to the extent that the production of such law enforcement records or information (A) could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings, (B) would deprive a person of a right to a fair trial or an impartial adjudication, (C) could reasonably be expected to constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy, (D) could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source, including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis, and, in the case of a record or information compiled by criminal law enforcement authority in the course of a criminal investigation or by an agency conducting a lawful national security intelligence investigation, information furnished by a confidential source, (E) would disclose techniques and procedures for law enforcement investigations or prosecutions, or would disclose guidelines for law enforcement <!-- PDFPage:29 -->investigations or prosecutions if such disclosure could reasonably be expected to risk circumvention of the law, or (F) could reasonably be expected to endanger the life or physical safety of any individual;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) geological and geophysical information and data, including maps, concerning wells.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any reasonably segregable portion of a record shall be provided to any person requesting such record after deletion of the portions which are exempt under this subsection. The amount of information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated on the released portion of the record, unless including that indication would harm an interest protected by the exemption in this subsection under which the deletion is made. If technically feasible, the amount of the information deleted, and the exemption under which the deletion is made, shall be indicated at the place in the record where such deletion is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records described in subsection (b)(7)(A) and&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the investigation or proceeding involves a possible violation of criminal law; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) there is reason to believe that (i) the subject of the investigation or proceeding is not aware of its pendency, and (ii) disclosure of the existence of the records could reasonably be expected to interfere with enforcement proceedings,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the agency may, during only such time as that circumstance continues, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Whenever informant records maintained by a criminal law enforcement agency under an informant's name or personal identifier are requested by a third party according to the informant's name or personal identifier, the agency may treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this section unless the informant's status as an informant has been officially confirmed.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever a request is made which involves access to records maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation pertaining to foreign intelligence or counterintelligence, or international terrorism, and the existence of the records is classified information as provided in subsection (b)(1), the Bureau may, as long as the existence of the records remains classified information, treat the records as not subject to the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) This section does not authorize withholding of information or limit the availability of records to the public, except as specifically stated in this section. This section is not authority to withhold information from Congress.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 110&ndash;175, &sect;2, Dec. 31, 2007, 121 Stat. 2524, provided that: &ldquo;Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Freedom of Information Act [probably means Pub. L. 89&ndash;487 which amended section 1002 of former Title 5, Executive Departments and Government Officers and Employees, see Historical and Revision notes above] was signed into law on July 4, 1966, because the American people believe that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) our constitutional democracy, our system of self-government, and our commitment to popular sovereignty depends upon the consent of the governed;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) such consent is not meaningful unless it is informed consent; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) as Justice Black noted in his concurring opinion in Barr v. Matteo (360 U.S. 564 (1959)), &lsquo;The effective functioning of a free government like ours depends largely on the force of an informed public opinion. This calls for the widest possible understanding of the quality of government service rendered by all elective or appointed public officials or employees.&rsquo;;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the American people firmly believe that our system of government must itself be governed by a presumption of openness;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Freedom of Information Act establishes a &lsquo;strong presumption in favor of disclosure&rsquo; as noted by the United States Supreme Court in United States Department of State v. Ray (502 U.S. 164 (1991)), a presumption that applies to all agencies governed by that Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) &lsquo;disclosure, not secrecy, is the dominant objective of the Act,&rsquo; as noted by the United States Supreme Court in Department of Air Force v. Rose (425 U.S. 352 (1976));</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) in practice, the Freedom of Information Act has not always lived up to the ideals of that Act; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Congress should regularly review section 552 of title 5, United States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of Information Act), in order to determine whether further changes and improvements are necessary to ensure that the Government remains open and accessible to the American people and is always based not upon the &lsquo;need to know&rsquo; but upon the fundamental &lsquo;right to know&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">Ex. Ord. No. 12600, June 23, 1987, 52 F.R. 23781, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, and in order to provide predisclosure notification procedures under the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552] concerning confidential commercial information, and to make existing agency notification provisions more uniform, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. The head of each Executive department and agency subject to the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552] shall, to the extent permitted by law, establish procedures to notify submitters of records containing confidential commercial information as described in section 3 of this Order, when those records are requested under the Freedom of Information Act [FOIA], 5 U.S.C. 552, as amended, if after reviewing the request, the responsive records, and any appeal by the requester, the department or agency determines that it may be required to disclose the records. Such notice requires that an agency use good-faith efforts to advise submitters of confidential commercial information of the procedures established under this Order. Further, where notification of a voluminous number of submitters is required, such notification may be accomplished by posting or publishing the notice in a place reasonably calculated to accomplish notification.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. For purposes of this Order, the following definitions apply:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) &ldquo;Confidential commercial information&rdquo; means records provided to the government by a submitter that arguably contain material exempt from release under Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4), because disclosure could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) &ldquo;Submitter&rdquo; means any person or entity who provides confidential commercial information to the government. The term &ldquo;submitter&rdquo; includes, but is not limited to, corporations, state governments, and foreign governments.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. (a) For confidential commercial information submitted prior to January 1, 1988, the head of each Executive department or agency shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide a submitter with notice pursuant to section 1 whenever:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) the records are less than 10 years old and the information has been designated by the submitter as confidential commercial information; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the department or agency has reason to believe that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) For confidential commercial information submitted on or after January 1, 1988, the head of each Executive department or agency shall, to the extent permitted by law, establish procedures to permit submitters of confidential commercial information to designate, at the time the information is submitted to the Federal government or a reasonable time thereafter, any information the disclosure of which the submitter claims could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm. Such agency procedures may provide for the expiration, after a specified period of time or changes in circumstances, of designations of competitive harm made by submitters. Additionally, such procedures may permit the agency to designate specific classes of information that will be treated by the agency as if the information had been so designated by the submitter. The head of each Executive department or agency shall, to the extent permitted by law, provide the submitter notice in accordance with section 1 of this Order whenever the department or agency determines that it may be required to disclose records:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) designated pursuant to this subsection; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) the disclosure of which the department or agency has reason to believe could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. When notification is made pursuant to section 1, each agency's procedures shall, to the extent permitted by law, afford the submitter a reasonable period of time in which the submitter or its designee may object to the disclosure of any specified portion of the information and to state all grounds upon which disclosure is opposed.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. Each agency shall give careful consideration to all such specified grounds for nondisclosure prior to making an administrative determination of the issue. In all instances when the agency determines to disclose the requested records, its procedures shall provide that the agency give the submitter a written statement briefly explaining why the submitter's objections are not sustained. Such statement shall, to the extent permitted by law, be provided a reasonable number of days prior to a specified disclosure date.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. Whenever a FOIA requester brings suit seeking to compel disclosure of confidential commercial information, each agency's procedures shall require that the submitter be promptly notified.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 7. The designation and notification procedures required by this Order shall be established by regulations, after notice and public comment. If similar procedures or regulations already exist, they should be reviewed for conformity and revised where necessary. Existing procedures or regulations need not be modified if they are in compliance with this Order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 8. The notice requirements of this Order need not be followed if:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The agency determines that the information should not be disclosed;</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) The information has been published or has been officially made available to the public;</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Disclosure of the information is required by law (other than 5 U.S.C. 552);</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) The disclosure is required by an agency rule that (1) was adopted pursuant to notice and public comment, (2) specifies narrow classes of records submitted to the agency that are to be released under the Freedom of Information Act [5 U.S.C. 552], and (3) provides in exceptional circumstances for notice when the submitter provides written justification, at the time the information is submitted or a reasonable time thereafter, that disclosure of the information could reasonably be expected to cause substantial competitive harm;</p>
<p class="note-body">(e) The information requested is not designated by the submitter as exempt from disclosure in accordance with agency regulations promulgated pursuant to section 7, when the submitter had an opportunity to do so at the time of submission of the information or a reasonable time thereafter, unless the agency has substan<!-- PDFPage:39 -->tial reason to believe that disclosure of the information would result in competitive harm; or</p>
<p class="note-body">(f) The designation made by the submitter in accordance with agency regulations promulgated pursuant to section 7 appears obviously frivolous; except that, in such case, the agency must provide the submitter with written notice of any final administrative disclosure determination within a reasonable number of days prior to the specified disclosure date.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 9. Whenever an agency notifies a submitter that it may be required to disclose information pursuant to section 1 of this Order, the agency shall also notify the requester that notice and an opportunity to comment are being provided the submitter. Whenever an agency notifies a submitter of a final decision pursuant to section 5 of this Order, the agency shall also notify the requester.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 10. This Order is intended only to improve the internal management of the Federal government, and is not intended to create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law by a party against the United States, its agencies, its officers, or any person.</p>

<p class="note-body">By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to ensure appropriate agency disclosure of information, and consistent with the goals of section 552 of title 5, United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Section</cap-smallcap> 1. <em>Policy.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) The effective functioning of our constitutional democracy depends upon the participation in public life of a citizenry that is well informed. For nearly four decades, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) [5 U.S.C. 552] has provided an important means through which the public can obtain information regarding the activities of Federal agencies. Under the FOIA, the public can obtain records from any Federal agency, subject to the exemptions enacted by the Congress to protect information that must be held in confidence for the Government to function effectively or for other purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) FOIA requesters are seeking a service from the Federal Government and should be treated as such. Accordingly, in responding to a FOIA request, agencies shall respond courteously and appropriately. Moreover, agencies shall provide FOIA requesters, and the public in general, with citizen-centered ways to learn about the FOIA process, about agency records that are publicly available (e.g., on the agency's website), and about the status of a person's FOIA request and appropriate information about the agency's response.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) Agency FOIA operations shall be both results-oriented and produce results. Accordingly, agencies shall process requests under the FOIA in an efficient and appropriate manner and achieve tangible, measurable improvements in FOIA processing. When an agency's FOIA program does not produce such results, it should be reformed, consistent with available resources appropriated by the Congress and applicable law, to increase efficiency and better reflect the policy goals and objectives of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) A citizen-centered and results-oriented approach will improve service and performance, thereby strengthening compliance with the FOIA, and will help avoid disputes and related litigation.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 2. <em>Agency Chief FOIA Officers.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Designation</em>. The head of each agency shall designate within 30 days of the date of this order a senior official of such agency (at the Assistant Secretary or equivalent level), to serve as the Chief FOIA Officer of that agency. The head of the agency shall promptly notify the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB Director) and the Attorney General of such designation and of any changes thereafter in such designation.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>General Duties</em>. The Chief FOIA Officer of each agency shall, subject to the authority of the head of the agency:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) have agency-wide responsibility for efficient and appropriate compliance with the FOIA;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) monitor FOIA implementation throughout the agency, including through the use of meetings with the public to the extent deemed appropriate by the agency's Chief FOIA Officer, and keep the head of the agency, the chief legal officer of the agency, and the Attorney General appropriately informed of the agency's performance in implementing the FOIA, including the extent to which the agency meets the milestones in the agency's plan under section 3(b) of this order and training and reporting standards established consistent with applicable law and this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) recommend to the head of the agency such adjustments to agency practices, policies, personnel, and funding as may be necessary to carry out the policy set forth in section 1 of this order;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) review and report, through the head of the agency, at such times and in such formats as the Attorney <!-- PDFPage:40 -->General may direct, on the agency's performance in implementing the FOIA; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) facilitate public understanding of the purposes of the FOIA's statutory exemptions by including concise descriptions of the exemptions in both the agency's FOIA handbook issued under section 552(g) of title 5, United States Code, and the agency's annual FOIA report, and by providing an overview, where appropriate, of certain general categories of agency records to which those exemptions apply.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>FOIA Requester Service Center and FOIA Public Liaisons</em>. In order to ensure appropriate communication with FOIA requesters:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Each agency shall establish one or more FOIA Requester Service Centers (Center), as appropriate, which shall serve as the first place that a FOIA requester can contact to seek information concerning the status of the person's FOIA request and appropriate information about the agency's FOIA response. The Center shall include appropriate staff to receive and respond to inquiries from FOIA requesters;</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) The agency Chief FOIA Officer shall designate one or more agency officials, as appropriate, as FOIA Public Liaisons, who may serve in the Center or who may serve in a separate office. FOIA Public Liaisons shall serve as supervisory officials to whom a FOIA requester can raise concerns about the service the FOIA requester has received from the Center, following an initial response from the Center staff. FOIA Public Liaisons shall seek to ensure a service-oriented response to FOIA requests and FOIA-related inquiries. For example, the FOIA Public Liaison shall assist, as appropriate, in reducing delays, increasing transparency and understanding of the status of requests, and resolving disputes. FOIA Public Liaisons shall report to the agency Chief FOIA Officer on their activities and shall perform their duties consistent with applicable law and agency regulations;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) In addition to the services to FOIA requesters provided by the Center and FOIA Public Liaisons, the agency Chief FOIA Officer shall also consider what other FOIA-related assistance to the public should appropriately be provided by the agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) In establishing the Centers and designating FOIA Public Liaisons, the agency shall use, as appropriate, existing agency staff and resources. A Center shall have appropriate staff to receive and respond to inquiries from FOIA requesters;</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) As determined by the agency Chief FOIA Officer, in consultation with the FOIA Public Liaisons, each agency shall post appropriate information about its Center or Centers on the agency's website, including contact information for its FOIA Public Liaisons. In the case of an agency without a website, the agency shall publish the information on the Firstgov.gov website or, in the case of any agency with neither a website nor the capability to post on the Firstgov.gov website, in the Federal Register; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(vi) The agency Chief FOIA Officer shall ensure that the agency has in place a method (or methods), including through the use of the Center, to receive and respond promptly and appropriately to inquiries from FOIA requesters about the status of their requests. The Chief FOIA Officer shall also consider, in consultation with the FOIA Public Liaisons, as appropriate, whether the agency's implementation of other means (such as tracking numbers for requests, or an agency telephone or Internet hotline) would be appropriate for responding to status inquiries.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 3. <em>Review, Plan, and Report.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Review</em>. Each agency's Chief FOIA Officer shall conduct a review of the agency's FOIA operations to determine whether agency practices are consistent with the policies set forth in section 1 of this order. In conducting this review, the Chief FOIA Officer shall:</p>
<p class="note-body">(i) evaluate, with reference to numerical and statistical benchmarks where appropriate, the agency's administration of the FOIA, including the agency's expenditure of resources on FOIA compliance and the extent to which, if any, requests for records have not been responded to within the statutory time limit (backlog);</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) review the processes and practices by which the agency assists and informs the public regarding the FOIA process;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) examine the agency's:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) use of information technology in responding to FOIA requests, including without limitation the tracking of FOIA requests and communication with requesters;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) practices with respect to requests for expedited processing; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) implementation of multi-track processing if used by such agency;</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) review the agency's policies and practices relating to the availability of public information through websites and other means, including the use of websites to make available the records described in section 552(a)(2) of title 5, United States Code; and</p>
<p class="note-body">(v) identify ways to eliminate or reduce its FOIA backlog, consistent with available resources and taking into consideration the volume and complexity of the FOIA requests pending with the agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Plan.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(i) Each agency's Chief FOIA Officer shall develop, in consultation as appropriate with the staff of the agency (including the FOIA Public Liaisons), the Attorney General, and the OMB Director, an agency-specific plan to ensure that the agency's administration of the FOIA is in accordance with applicable law and the policies set forth in section 1 of this order. The plan, which shall be submitted to the head of the agency for approval, shall address the agency's implementation of the FOIA during fiscal years 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) The plan shall include specific activities that the agency will implement to eliminate or reduce the agency's FOIA backlog, including (as applicable) changes that will make the processing of FOIA requests more streamlined and effective, as well as increased reliance on the dissemination of records that can be made available to the public through a website or other means that do not require the public to make a request for the records under the FOIA.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) The plan shall also include activities to increase public awareness of FOIA processing, including as appropriate, expanded use of the agency's Center and its FOIA Public Liaisons.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iv) The plan shall also include, taking appropriate account of the resources available to the agency and the mission of the agency, concrete milestones, with specific timetables and outcomes to be achieved, by which the head of the agency, after consultation with the OMB Director, shall measure and evaluate the agency's success in the implementation of the plan.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) <em>Agency Reports to the Attorney General and OMB Director.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(i) The head of each agency shall submit a report, no later than 6 months from the date of this order, to the Attorney General and the OMB Director that summarizes the results of the review under section 3(a) of this order and encloses a copy of the agency's plan under section 3(b) of this order. The agency shall publish a copy of the agency's report on the agency's website or, in the case of an agency without a website, on the Firstgov.gov website, or, in the case of any agency with neither a website nor the capability to publish on the Firstgov.gov website, in the Federal Register.</p>
<p class="note-body">(ii) The head of each agency shall include in the agency's annual FOIA reports for fiscal years 2006 and 2007 a report on the agency's development and implementation of its plan under section 3(b) of this order and on the agency's performance in meeting the milestones set forth in that plan, consistent with any related guidelines the Attorney General may issue under section 552(e) of title 5, United States Code.</p>
<p class="note-body">(iii) If the agency does not meet a milestone in its plan, the head of the agency shall:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(A) identify this deficiency in the annual FOIA report to the Attorney General;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(B) explain in the annual report the reasons for the agency's failure to meet the milestone;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(C) outline in the annual report the steps that the agency has already taken, and will be taking, to address the deficiency; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:41 --><p class="note-body-1em">(D) report this deficiency to the President's Management Council.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 4. <em>Attorney General.</em></p>
<p class="note-body">(a) <em>Report</em>.

The Attorney General shall consult the OMB Director in the preparation of the report and shall include in the report appropriate recommendations on administrative or other agency actions for continued agency dissemination and release of public information. The Attorney General shall thereafter submit two further annual reports, by June 1, 2007, and June 1, 2008, that provide the President with an update on the agencies&rsquo; implementation of the FOIA and of their plans under section 3(b) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) <em>Guidance</em>. The Attorney General shall issue such instructions and guidance to the heads of departments and agencies as may be appropriate to implement sections 3(b) and 3(c) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 5. <em>OMB Director</em>. The OMB Director may issue such instructions to the heads of agencies as are necessary to implement this order, other than sections 3(b) and 3(c) of this order.</p>
<p class="note-body"><cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 6. <em>Definitions</em>. As used in this order:</p>
