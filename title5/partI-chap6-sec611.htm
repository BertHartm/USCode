<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) A small entity may seek such review during the period beginning on the date of final agency action and ending one year later, except that where a provision of law requires that an action challenging a final agency action be commenced before the expiration of one year, such lesser period shall apply to an action for judicial review under this section.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) where a provision of law requires that an action challenging a final agency regulation be commenced before the expiration of the 1-year period, the number of days specified in such provision of law that is after the date the analysis is made available to the public.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) In granting any relief in an action under this section, the court shall order the agency to take corrective action consistent with this chapter and chapter 7, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) remanding the rule to the agency, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) deferring the enforcement of the rule against small entities unless the court finds that continued enforcement of the rule is in the public interest.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:103 --><p class="statutory-body">(5) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to limit the authority of any court to stay the effective date of any rule or provision thereof under any other provision of law or to grant any other relief in addition to the requirements of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In an action for the judicial review of a rule, the regulatory flexibility analysis for such rule, including an analysis prepared or corrected pursuant to paragraph (a)(4), shall constitute part of the entire record of agency action in connection with such review.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Compliance or noncompliance by an agency with the provisions of this chapter shall be subject to judicial review only in accordance with this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Nothing in this section bars judicial review of any other impact statement or similar analysis required by any other law if judicial review of such statement or analysis is otherwise permitted by law.</p>
