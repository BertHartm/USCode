<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">without regard to the pendency or outcome of any appeal (other than a judgment of acquittal based on innocence) or request for relief on behalf of the individual or entity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Notwithstanding section 8902(j) or any other provision of this chapter, if, under subsection (b) or (c), a provider is barred from participating in the program under this chapter, no payment may be made by a carrier pursuant to any contract under this chapter (either to such provider or by reimbursement) for any service or supply furnished by such provider during the period of the debarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each contract under this chapter shall contain such provisions as may be necessary to carry out subparagraph (A) and the other provisions of this section.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Whenever the Office determines&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in connection with a claim presented under this chapter, that a provider of health care services or supplies&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) has charged for health care services or supplies in an amount substantially in ex<!-- PDFPage:862 -->cess of such provider's customary charges for such services or supplies, or charged for health care services or supplies which are substantially in excess of the needs of the covered individual or which are of a quality that fails to meet professionally recognized standards for such services or supplies;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that a provider of health care services or supplies has knowingly made, or caused to be made, any false statement or misrepresentation of a material fact which is reflected in a claim presented under this chapter; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that a provider of health care services or supplies has knowingly failed to provide any information required by a carrier or by the Office to determine whether a payment or reimbursement is payable under this chapter or the amount of any such payment or reimbursement;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">the Office may, in addition to any other penalties that may be prescribed by law, and after consultation with the Attorney General, impose a civil monetary penalty of not more than $10,000 for any item or service involved. In addition, such a provider shall be subject to an assessment of not more than twice the amount claimed for each such item or service. In addition, the Office may make a determination in the same proceeding to bar such provider from participating in the program under this chapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Office&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) may not initiate any debarment proceeding against a provider, based on such provider's having been convicted of a criminal offense, later than 6 years after the date on which such provider is so convicted; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) may not initiate any action relating to a civil penalty, assessment, or debarment under this section, in connection with any claim, later than 6 years after the date the claim is presented, as determined under regulations prescribed by the Office.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) In making a determination relating to the appropriateness of imposing or the period of any debarment under this section, or the appropriateness of imposing or the amount of any civil penalty or assessment under this section, the Office shall take into account&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the nature of any claims involved and the circumstances under which they were presented;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the degree of culpability, history of prior offenses or improper conduct of the provider involved; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) such other matters as justice may require.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) The debarment of a provider under subsection (b) or (c) shall be effective at such time and upon such reasonable notice to such provider, and to carriers and covered individuals, as may be specified in regulations prescribed by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), a debarment shall be effective with respect to any health care services or supplies furnished by a provider on or after the effective date of such provider's debarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) A debarment shall not apply with respect to inpatient institutional services furnished to an individual who was admitted to the institution before the date the debarment would otherwise become effective until the passage of 30 days after such date, unless the Office determines that the health or safety of the individual receiving those services warrants that a shorter period, or that no such period, be afforded.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any notice referred to in paragraph (1) shall specify the date as of which debarment becomes effective and the minimum period of time for which such debarment is to remain effective.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) A provider barred from participating in the program under this chapter may, after the expiration of the minimum period of debarment referred to in paragraph (3), apply to the Office, in such manner as the Office may by regulation prescribe, for termination of the debarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Office may&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant to an application filed by such provider after the end of the minimum debarment period, if the Office determines, based on the conduct of the applicant, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) there is no basis under subsection (b) or (c) for continuing the debarment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) there are reasonable assurances that the types of actions which formed the basis for the original debarment have not recurred and will not recur; or</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) notwithstanding any provision of subparagraph (A), terminate the debarment of a provider, pursuant to an application filed by such provider before the end of the minimum debarment period, if the Office determines that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) based on the conduct of the applicant, the requirements of subclauses (I) and (II) of clause (i) have been met; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) early termination under this clause is warranted based on the fact that the provider is the sole community provider or the sole source of essential specialized services in a community, or other similar circumstances.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Office shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) promptly notify the appropriate State or local agency or authority having responsibility for the licensing or certification of a provider barred from participation in the program under this chapter of the fact of the debarment, as well as the reasons for such debarment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) request that appropriate investigations be made and sanctions invoked in accordance with applicable law and policy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) request that the State or local agency or authority keep the Office fully and currently informed with respect to any actions taken in response to the request.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Office shall, upon written request and payment of a reasonable charge to defray the cost of complying with such request, furnish a current list of any providers barred from participating in the program under this chapter, including the minimum period of time remaining under the terms of each provider's debarment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The Office may not make a determination under subsection (b) or (c) adverse to a provider of health care services or supplies until such provider has been given written notice and <!-- PDFPage:863 -->an opportunity for a hearing on the record. A provider is entitled to be represented by counsel, to present witnesses, and to cross-examine witnesses against the provider in any such hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding section 8912, any person adversely affected by a final decision under paragraph (1) may obtain review of such decision in the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. A written petition requesting that the decision be modified or set aside must be filed within 60 days after the date on which such person is notified of such decision.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Matters that were raised or that could have been raised in a hearing under paragraph (1) or an appeal under paragraph (2) may not be raised as a defense to a civil action by the United States to collect a penalty or assessment imposed under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) A civil action to recover civil monetary penalties or assessments under subsection (c) shall be brought by the Attorney General in the name of the United States, and may be brought in the United States district court for the district where the claim involved was presented or where the person subject to the penalty resides. Amounts recovered under this section shall be paid to the Office for deposit into the Employees Health Benefits Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) The Office shall prescribe regulations under which, with respect to services or supplies furnished by a debarred provider to a covered individual during the period of such provider's debarment, payment or reimbursement under this chapter may be made, notwithstanding the fact of such debarment, if such individual did not know or could not reasonably be expected to have known of the debarment. In any such instance, the carrier involved shall take appropriate measures to ensure that the individual is informed of the debarment and the minimum period of time remaining under the terms of the debarment.</p>
