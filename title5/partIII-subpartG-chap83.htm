<p class="statutory-body">(b) An employee or Member must complete, within the last 2 years before any separation from service, except a separation because of death or disability, at least 1 year of creditable civilian service during which he is subject to this subchapter before he or his survivors are eligible for annuity under this subchapter based on the separation.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Each employee or Member is deemed to consent and agree to these deductions from basic pay. Notwithstanding any law or regulation affecting the pay of an employee or Member, payment less these deductions is a full and complete discharge and acquittance of all claims and demands for regular services during the period covered by the payment, except the right to the benefits to which the employee or Member is entitled under this subchapter.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;8337. Disability retirement</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An employee who completes 5 years of civilian service and has become disabled shall be retired on the employee's own application or on application by the employee's agency. Any employee shall be considered to be disabled only if the employee is found by the Office of Personnel Management to be unable, because of disease or injury, to render useful and efficient service in the employee's position and is not qualified for reassignment, under procedures prescribed by the Office, to a vacant position which is in the agency at the same grade or level and in which the employee would be able to render useful and efficient service. For the purpose of the preceding sentence, an employee of the United States Postal Service shall be considered not qualified for a reassignment described in that sentence if the reassignment is to a position in a different craft or is inconsistent with the terms of a collective bargaining agreement covering the employee. A judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces who completes 5 years of civilian service and who is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a judge of such court or who is removed for mental or physical disability under section 942(c) of title 10 shall be retired on the judge's own application or upon such removal. A Member who completes 5 years of Member service and is found by the Office to be disabled for useful and efficient service as a Member because of disease or injury shall be retired on the Member's own application. An annuity authorized by this section is computed under section 8339(g) of this title, unless the employee or Member is eligible for a higher annuity computed under section 8339(a) through (e), (n), (q), (r), or (s).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) A claim may be allowed under this section only if the application is filed with the Office before the employee or Member is separated from the service or within 1 year thereafter. This time limitation may be waived by the Office for an employee or Member who at the date of separation from service or within 1 year thereafter is mentally incompetent, if the application is filed with the Office within 1 year from the date of restoration of the employee or Member to competency or the appointment of a fiduciary, whichever is earlier.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund shall be examined under the direction of the Office&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) at the end of 1 year from the date of the disability retirement; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) annually thereafter until he becomes 60 years of age;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">unless his disability is permanent in character. If the annuitant fails to submit to examination as required by this section, payment of the annuity shall be suspended until continuance of the disability is satisfactorily established.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, recovers from his disability, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 1 year after the date of the medical examination showing the recovery, whichever is earlier. If an annuitant receiving disability retirement annuity from the Fund, before becoming 60 years of age, is restored to an earning capacity fairly comparable to the current rate of pay of the position occupied at the time of retirement, payment of the annuity terminates on reemployment by the Government or 180 days after the end of the calendar year in which earning capacity is so restored, whichever is earlier. Earning capacity is deemed restored if in any calendar year the income of the annuitant from wages or self-employment or both equals at least 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If an annuitant whose annuity is terminated under subsection (d) of this section is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, he is deemed, except for service credit, to have been involuntarily separated from the service for the purpose of this subchapter as of the date of termination of the disability annuity, and after that termination is entitled to annuity under the applicable provisions of this subchapter. If an annuitant whose annuity is heretofore or hereafter terminated because of an earning capacity provision of this subchapter or an earlier statute&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) has not recovered from the disability for which he was retired;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">his annuity shall be restored at the same rate effective the first of the year following any calendar year in which his income from wages or self-employment or both is less than 80 percent of the current rate of pay of the position occupied immediately before retirement. If an annuitant whose annuity is heretofore or hereafter terminated because of a medical finding that he has recovered from disability is not reemployed in a position in which he is subject to this subchapter, his annuity shall be restored at the same rate effective from the date of medical examination showing a recurrence of the disability. The second and third sentences of this subsection do not apply to an individual who has become 62 years of age and is receiving or is eligible to receive annuity under the first sentence of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) An individual is not entitled to receive&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) an annuity under this subchapter, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) compensation for injury to, or disability of, such individual under subchapter I of chapter 81, other than compensation payable under section 8107,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">covering the same period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An individual is not entitled to receive an annuity under this subchapter and a concurrent benefit under subchapter I of chapter 81 on account of the death of the same person.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraphs (1) and (2) do not bar the right of a claimant to the greater benefit conferred by either this subchapter or subchapter I of chapter 81.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) If an individual is entitled to an annuity under this subchapter, and the individual re<!-- PDFPage:767 -->ceives a lump-sum payment for compensation under section 8135 based on the disability or death of the same person, so much of the compensation as has been paid for a period extended beyond the date payment of the annuity commences, as determined by the Department of Labor, shall be refunded to that Department for credit to the Employees&rsquo; Compensation Fund. Before the individual may receive the annuity, the individual shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) refund to the Department of Labor the amount representing the commuted compensation payments for the extended period; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) authorize the deduction of the amount from the annuity.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Deductions from the annuity may be made from accrued or accruing payments. The amounts deducted and withheld from the annuity shall be transmitted to the Department of Labor for reimbursement to the Employees&rsquo; Compensation Fund. When the Department of Labor finds that the financial circumstances of an individual entitled to an annuity under this subchapter warrant deferred refunding, deductions from the annuity may be prorated against and paid from accruing payments in such manner as the Department determines appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) As used in this subsection, the term &ldquo;technician&rdquo; means an individual employed under section 709(a) of title 32 or section 10216 of title 10 who, as a condition of the employment, is required under section 709(b) of title 32 or section 10216 of title 10, respectively, to be a member of the Selected Reserve.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph, an individual shall be retired under this section if the individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) is separated from employment as a technician under section 709(e)(1) of title 32 or section 10216 of title 10 by reason of a disability that disqualifies the individual from membership in the Selected Reserve;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) is not considered to be disabled under the second sentence of subsection (a) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) is not appointed to a position in the Government (whether under paragraph (3) of this subsection or otherwise); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) has not declined an offer of an appointment to a position in the Government under paragraph (3) of this subsection.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Payment of any annuity for an individual pursuant to this subsection terminates&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) on the date the individual is appointed to a position in the Government (whether pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection or otherwise);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) on the date the individual declines an offer of appointment to a position in the Government under paragraph (3); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) as provided under subsection (d).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Any individual applying for or receiving any annuity pursuant to this subsection shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Office, be considered by any agency of the Government before any vacant position in the agency is filled if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the position is located within the commuting area of the individual's former position;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the individual is qualified to serve in such position, as determined by the head of the agency; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the position is at the same grade or equivalent level as the position from which the individual was separated under section 709(e)(1) of title 32 or section 10216 of title 10.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an employee or Member before October 11, 1962; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a retired employee or Member whose retirement was based on a separation from service before October 11, 1962;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">is increased by 10 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) An annuity shall not be increased by reason of any adjustment under this section to an amount which exceeds the greater of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the maximum pay payable for GS&ndash;15 30 days before the effective date of the adjustment under this section; or</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management, an employee or Member may voluntarily contribute additional sums in multiples of $25, but the total may not exceed 10 percent of his basic pay for creditable service after July 31, 1920. The voluntary contribution account in each case is the sum of unrefunded contributions, plus interest at 3 percent a year through December 31, 1984, and thereafter at the rate computed under section 8334(e) of this title, compounded annually to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the date of payment under subsection (d) of this section, separation, or transfer to a position in which he does not continue subject to this subchapter, whichever is earliest; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the commencing date fixed for a deferred annuity or date of death, whichever is earlier, in the case of an individual who is separated with title to deferred annuity and does not claim the voluntary contribution account.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The voluntary contribution account is used to purchase at retirement an annuity in addition to the annuity otherwise provided. For each $100 in the voluntary contribution account, the additional annuity consists of $7, increased by 20 cents for each full year, if any, the employee or Member is over 55 years of age at the date of retirement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A retiring employee or Member may elect a reduced additional annuity instead of the addi<!-- PDFPage:799 -->tional annuity described by subsection (b) of this section and designate in writing an individual to receive after his death an annuity of 50 percent of his reduced additional annuity. The additional annuity of the employee or Member making the election is reduced by 10 percent, and by 5 percent for each full 5 years the individual designated is younger than the retiring employee or Member. However, the total reduction may not exceed 40 percent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A present or former employee or Member is entitled to be paid the voluntary contribution account if he files application for payment with the Office before receiving an additional annuity. An individual who has been paid the voluntary contribution account may not again deposit additional sums under this section until, after a separation from the service of more than 3 calendar days, he again becomes subject to this subchapter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If a present or former employee or Member not retired dies, the voluntary contribution account is paid under section 8342(c) of this title. If all additional annuities or any right thereto based on the voluntary contribution account of a deceased employee or Member terminate before the total additional annuity paid equals the account, the difference is paid under section 8342(c) of this title.</p>

The amounts so deducted shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States to the credit of the Fund. If the annuitant serves on a full-time basis, except as President, for at least 1 year, on a part-time basis for periods equivalent to at least 1 year of full-time service, in employment not excluding him from coverage under section 8331(1)(i) or (ii) of this title&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsections (a) and (b), the words &ldquo;except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under section 61b of this title&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary as section 5551(a) provides that a &ldquo;lump-sum leave payment is considered pay for taxation purposes only&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;after September 30, 1956&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo; on authority of &sect;406 of the Act of July 31, 1956, ch. 804, 70 Stat. 761.

In the third sentence, the words &ldquo;and this provision concerning the lump-sum leave payments shall also be effective in the case of each retired employee separated from reemployment after December 15, 1953, and before the effective date of the Civil Service Retirement Act Amendments of 1956&rdquo; are omitted as executed, and any existing rights are preserved by technical section 8. In the fourth sentence, the words &ldquo;except as President&rdquo; are added to preserve the exception stated in former section 2252(b). In the penultimate sentence, the words &ldquo;after October 3, 1961&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;on or after October 4, 1961&rdquo;. In the last sentence, the words &ldquo;in any manner&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the words &ldquo;receiving annuity from the Fund&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;heretofore or hereafter retired under this chapter&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;hereafter&rdquo; is omitted as unnecessary. In paragraph (1)(B), the words &ldquo;the day after&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the first day of the month following&rdquo; on authority of former section 2264(b), which is carried into section 8345(b). In paragraph (1), former clause (C) is omitted as obsolete. In paragraph (2)(D), the words &ldquo;of the United States&rdquo; are omitted as unnecessary.</p>

<p class="note-body">In subsection (a), the words &ldquo;after July 11, 1960&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;on or after July 12, 1960.&rdquo; In subsection (b)(1), the amendment is made for consistency within the subchapter.</p>
<p class="note-body">In the codification of 5 U.S.C. 8344 by Public Law 89&ndash;554, the words &ldquo;except for lump-sum leave payment purposes under section 61b of this title&rdquo; were omitted from the third sentence of subsection (a) and from subsection (b)(2)(C) on the basis that they were unnecessary since former 5 U.S.C. 61b [now codified as 5 U.S.C. 5551(a)] provided that a lump-sum leave payment was considered pay for taxation purposes only. This amendment restores to 5 U.S.C. 8344 the language that was so omitted to conform to the source statute (section 13 of the Civil Service Retirement Act, as amended) and in recognition that the language was expressly placed in the source statute to overcome certain decisions of the Comptroller General of the United States (see 28 Comp. Gen. 294; 33 id. 591, and 36 id. 209).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h) An individual entitled to an annuity from the Fund may make allotments or assignments of amounts from his annuity for such purposes as the Office of Personnel Management in its sole discretion considers appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i)(1) No payment shall be made from the Fund unless an application for benefits based on the service of an employee or Member is received in the Office of Personnel Management before the one hundred and fifteenth anniversary of his birth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (1) of this subsection, after the death of an employee, Member, or annuitant, no benefit based on his service shall be paid from the Fund unless an application therefor is received in the Office of Personnel Management within 30 years after the death or other event which gives rise to title to the benefit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j)(1) Payments under this subchapter which would otherwise be made to an employee, Member, or annuitant based on service of that individual shall be paid (in whole or in part) by the Office to another person if and to the extent expressly provided for in the terms of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation, or the terms of any court order or court-approved property settlement agreement incident to any court decree of divorce, annulment, or legal separation; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Paragraph (1) shall only apply to payments made by the Office under this subchapter after the date of receipt in the Office of written notice of such decree, order, other legal process, or <!-- PDFPage:807 -->agreement, and such additional information and documentation as the Office may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For the purpose of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the term &ldquo;court&rdquo; means any court of any State, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, or the Virgin Islands, and any Indian court;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the term &ldquo;judgment rendered for physically, sexually, or emotionally abusing a child&rdquo; means any legal claim perfected through a final enforceable judgment, which claim is based in whole or in part upon the physical, sexual, or emotional abuse of a child, whether or not that abuse is accompanied by other actionable wrongdoing, such as sexual exploitation or gross negligence; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) the term &ldquo;child&rdquo; means an individual under 18 years of age.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(k)(1) The Office shall, in accordance with this subsection, enter into an agreement with any State within 120 days of a request for agreement from the proper State official. The agreement shall provide that the Office shall withhold State income tax in the case of the monthly annuity of any annuitant who voluntarily requests, in writing, such withholding. The amounts withheld during any calendar quarter shall be held in the Fund and disbursed to the States during the month following that calendar quarter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An annuitant may have in effect at any time only one request for withholding under this subsection, and an annuitant may not have more than two such requests in effect during any one calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, an annuitant may change the State designated by that annuitant for purposes of having withholdings made, and may request that the withholdings be remitted in accordance with such change. An annuitant also may revoke any request of that annuitant for withholding. Any change in the State designated or revocation is effective on the first day of the month after the month in which the request or the revocation is processed by the Office, but in no event later than on the first day of the second month beginning after the day on which such request or revocation is received by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) This subsection does not give the consent of the United States to the application of a statute which imposes more burdensome requirements on the United States than on employers generally, or which subjects the United States or any annuitant to a penalty or liability because of this subsection. The Office may not accept pay from a State for services performed in withholding State income taxes from annuities. Any amount erroneously withheld from an annuity and paid to a State by the Office shall be repaid by the State in accordance with regulations issued by the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For the purpose of this subsection, &ldquo;State&rdquo; means a State, the District of Columbia, or any territory or possession of the United States.</p>
