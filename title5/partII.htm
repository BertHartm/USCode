<p class="note-body">Section 3 of Pub. L. 95&ndash;454 provided that: &ldquo;It is the policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in order to provide the people of the United States with a competent, honest, and productive Federal work force reflective of the Nation's diversity, and to improve the quality of public service, Federal personnel management should be implemented consistent with merit system principles and free from prohibited personnel practices;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the merit system principles which shall govern in the competitive service and in the executive branch of the Federal Government should be expressly stated to furnish guidance to Federal agencies in carrying out their responsibilities in administering the public business, and prohibited personnel practices should be statutorily defined to enable Federal employees to avoid conduct which undermines the merit system principles and the integrity of the merit system;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Federal employees should receive appropriate protection through increasing the authority and powers of the Merit Systems Protection Board in processing hearings and appeals affecting Federal employees;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the authority and power of the Special Counsel should be increased so that the Special Counsel may investigate allegations involving prohibited personnel practices and reprisals against Federal employees for the lawful disclosure of certain information and may file complaints against agency officials and employees who engage in such conduct;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the function of filling positions and other personnel functions in the competitive service and in the executive branch should be delegated in appropriate cases to the agencies to expedite processing appointments and other personnel actions, with the control and oversight of this delegation being maintained by the Office of Personnel Management to protect against prohibited personnel practices and the use of unsound management practices by the agencies;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) a Senior Executive Service should be established to provide the flexibility needed by agencies to recruit and retain the highly competent and qualified executives needed to provide more effective management of agencies and their functions, and the more expeditious administration of the public business;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) in appropriate instances, pay increases should be based on quality of performance rather than length of service;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) research programs and demonstration projects should be authorized to permit Federal agencies to experiment, subject to congressional oversight, with new and different personnel management concepts in controlled situations to achieve more efficient management of the Government's human resources and greater productivity in the delivery of service to the public;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the training program of the Government should include retraining of employees for positions in other agencies to avoid separations during reductions in force and the loss to the Government of the knowledge and experience that these employees possess; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the right of Federal employees to organize, bargain collectively, and participate through labor organizations in decisions which affect them, with <!-- PDFPage:119 -->full regard for the public interest and the effective conduct of public business, should be specifically recognized in statute.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-block">To the Congress of the United States:</p>
<p class="note-body">On March 2nd I sent to Congress a Civil Service Reform proposal to enable the Federal government to improve its service to the American people.</p>
<p class="note-body">Today I am submitting another part of my comprehensive proposal to reform the Federal personnel management system through Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1978. The plan will reorganize the Civil Service Commission and thereby create new institutions to increase the effectiveness of management and strengthen the protection of employee rights.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Civil Service Commission has acquired inherently conflicting responsibilities: to help manage the Federal Government and to protect the rights of Federal employees. It has done neither job well. The Plan would separate the two functions.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">office of personnel management</h4>
<p class="note-body">The positive personnel management tasks of the government&mdash;such as training, productivity programs, examinations, and pay and benefits administration&mdash;would be the responsibility of an Office of Personnel Management. Its Director, appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would be responsible for administering Federal personnel matters except for Presidential appointments. The Director would be the government's principal representative in Federal labor relations matters.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">merit systems protection board</h4>
<p class="note-body">The adjudication and prosecution responsibilities of the Civil Service Commission will be performed by the Merit Systems Protection Board. The Board will be headed by a bipartisan panel of three members appointed to six-year, staggered terms. This Board would be the first independent and institutionally impartial Federal agency solely for the protection of Federal employees.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Plan will create, within the Board, a Special Counsel to investigate and prosecute political abuses <!-- PDFPage:122 -->and merit system violations. Under the civil service reform legislation now being considered by the Congress, the Counsel would have power to investigate and prevent reprisals against employees who report illegal acts&mdash;the so-called &ldquo;whistleblowers.&rdquo; The Council would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">federal labor relations authority</h4>
<p class="note-body">An Executive Order now vests existing labor-management relations in a part-time Federal Labor-Relations Council, comprised of three top government managers; other important functions are assigned to the Assistant Secretary of Labor for Labor-Management Relations. This arrangement is defective because the Council members are part-time, they come exclusively from the ranks of management and their jurisdiction is fragmented.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Plan I submit today would consolidate the central policymaking functions in labor-management relations now divided between the Council and the Assistant Secretary into one Federal Labor Relations Authority. The Authority would be composed of three full-time members appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate. Its General Counsel, also appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate, would present unfair labor practice complaints. The Plan also provides for the continuance of the Federal Service Impasses Panel within the Authority to resolve negotiating impasses between Federal employee unions and agencies.</p>
<p class="note-body">The cost of replacing the Civil Service Commission can be paid by our present resources. The reorganization itself would neither increase nor decrease the costs of personnel management throughout the government. But taken together with the substantive reforms I have proposed, this Plan will greatly improve the government's ability to manage programs, speed the delivery of Federal services to the public, and aid in executing other reorganizations I will propose to the Congress, by improving Federal personnel management.</p>
<p class="note-body">Each of the provisions of this proposed reorganization would accomplish one or more of the purposes set forth in 5 U.S.C. 901(a). No functions are abolished by the Plan, but the offices referred to in 5 U.S.C. 5109(b) and 5 U.S.C. 1103(d) are abolished. The portions of the Plan providing for the appointment and pay for the head and one or more officers of the Office of Personnel Management, the Merit Systems Protection Board, the Federal Labor Relations Authority and the Federal Service Impasses Panel, are necessary to carry out the reorganization. The rates of compensation are comparable to those for similar positions within the Executive Branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">I am confident that this Plan and the companion civil service reform legislation will both lead to more effective protection of Federal employees&rsquo; legitimate rights and a more rewarding workplace. At the same time the American people will benefit from a better managed, more productive and more efficient Federal Government.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Any member of the Merit Systems Protection Board, any administrative law judge appointed by the Board under section 3105 of this title, and any employee of the Board designated by the Board may administer oaths, examine witnesses, take depositions, and receive evidence.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d) A subpoena referred to in subsection (b)(2)(A) may, in the case of any individual outside the territorial jurisdiction of any court of the United States, be served in such manner as the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure prescribe for service of a subpoena in a foreign country. To the extent that the courts of the United States can assert jurisdiction over such individual, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia shall have the same jurisdiction to take any action respecting compliance under this subsection by such individual that such court would have if such individual were personally within the jurisdiction of such court.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1)(A) In any proceeding under subsection (a)(1), any member of the Board may request from the Director of the Office of Personnel Management an advisory opinion concerning the interpretation of any rule, regulation, or other policy directive promulgated by the Office of Personnel Management.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(ii) An order issued under this subparagraph may be enforced in the same manner as provided <!-- PDFPage:132 -->for under paragraph (2) with respect to any order under subsection (a)(2).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In enforcing compliance with any order under subsection (a)(2), the Board may order that any employee charged with complying with such order, other than an employee appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall not be entitled to receive payment for service as an employee during any period that the order has not been complied with.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Board shall prescribe regulations under which any employee who is aggrieved by the failure of any other employee to comply with an order of the Board may petition the Board to exercise its authority under subparagraph (A).</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In reviewing any provision of any rule or regulation pursuant to this subsection, the Board shall declare such provision&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) invalid on its face, if the Board determines that such provision would, if implemented by any agency, on its face, require any employee to violate section 2302(b); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) invalidly implemented by any agency, if the Board determines that such provision, as it has been implemented by the agency through any personnel action taken by the agency or through any policy adopted by the agency in conformity with such provision, has required any employee to violate section 2302(b).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and the head of any agency implementing any provision of any rule or regulation under review pursuant to this subsection, shall have the right to participate in such review.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(j) The Chairman of the Board may appoint such personnel as may be necessary to perform the functions of the Board.

<p class="statutory-body">(k) The Board shall prepare and submit to the President, and, at the same time, to the appropriate committees of Congress, an annual budget of the expenses and other items relating to the Board which shall, as revised, be included as a separate item in the budget required to be transmitted to the Congress under section 1105 of title 31.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(<em>l</em>) The Board shall submit to the President, and, at the same time, to each House of the Congress, any legislative recommendations of the Board relating to any of its functions under this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(m)(1) Except as provided in paragraph (2) of this subsection, the Board, or an administrative law judge or other employee of the Board designated to hear a case arising under section 1215, may require payment by the agency involved of reasonable attorney fees incurred by an employee or applicant for employment if the employee or applicant is the prevailing party and the Board, administrative law judge, or other employee (as the case may be) determines that payment by the agency is warranted in the interest of justice, including any case in which a prohibited personnel practice was engaged in by the agency or any case in which the agency's action was clearly without merit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) If an employee or applicant for employment is the prevailing party of a case arising under section 1215 and the decision is based on a finding of discrimination prohibited under section 2302(b)(1) of this title, the payment of attorney fees shall be in accordance with the standards prescribed under section 706(k) of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. 2000e&ndash;5(k)).</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">(5) In addition to any authority granted under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel may, in the absence of an allegation, conduct an investigation for the purpose of determining whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice (or a pattern of prohibited personnel practices) has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1)(A)(i) The Special Counsel may request any member of the Merit Systems Protection Board to order a stay of any personnel action for 45 days if the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the personnel action was taken, or is to be taken, as a result of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A)(i) Except as provided under clause (ii), no later than 240 days after the date of receiving an allegation of a prohibited personnel practice under paragraph (1), the Special Counsel shall make a determination whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) If the Special Counsel is unable to make the required determination within the 240-day period specified under clause (i) and the person submitting the allegation of a prohibited personnel practice agrees to an extension of time, the determination shall be made within such additional period of time as shall be agreed upon between the Special Counsel and the person submitting the allegation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) If, in connection with any investigation, the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken which requires corrective action, the Special Counsel shall report the determination together with any findings or recommendations to the Board, the agency involved and to the Office of Personnel Management, and may report such determination, findings and recommendations to the President. The Special Counsel may include in the report recommendations for corrective action to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If, after a reasonable period of time, the agency does not act to correct the prohibited personnel practice, the Special Counsel may petition the Board for corrective action.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(E) A determination by the Special Counsel under this paragraph shall not be cited or referred to in any proceeding under this paragraph or any other administrative or judicial proceeding for any purpose, without the consent of the person submitting the allegation of a prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever the Special Counsel petitions the Board for corrective action, the Board shall provide an opportunity for&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) written comments by any individual who alleges to be the subject of the prohibited personnel practice.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) The Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate, if the Board determines that the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a prohibited personnel practice, other than one described in section 2302(b)(8), has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B)(i) Subject to the provisions of clause (ii), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a disclosure described under section 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against the individual.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(ii) Corrective action under clause (i) may not be ordered if the agency demonstrates by clear and convincing evidence that it would have taken the same personnel action in the absence of such disclosure.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Judicial review of any final order or decision of the Board under this section may be obtained by any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment adversely affected by such order or decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the alleged violation has been reported to the Attorney General; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the Attorney General is pursuing an investigation, in which case the Special Counsel, after consultation with the Attorney General, has discretion as to whether to proceed.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If, in connection with any investigation under this subchapter, the Special Counsel determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that any violation of any law, rule, or regulation has occurred other than one referred to in subsection (b) or (d), the Special Counsel shall report such violation to the head of the agency involved.

<p class="statutory-body">(b) This section may not be construed to prohibit any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment from seeking corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board before seeking corrective action from the Special Counsel, if such employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has the right to appeal directly to the Board under any law, rule, or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Any employee, former employee, or applicant for employment seeking corrective action under subsection (a) may request that the Board order a stay of the personnel action involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any stay requested under paragraph (1) shall be granted within 10 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date the request is made, if the Board determines that such a stay would be appropriate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) The Board shall allow any agency which would be subject to a stay under this subsection to comment to the Board on such stay request.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Except as provided in subparagraph (C), a stay granted under this subsection shall remain in effect for such period as the Board determines to be appropriate.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) At the request of an employee, former employee, or applicant for employment seeking corrective action under subsection (a), the Board shall issue a subpoena for the attendance and testimony of any person or the production of documentary or other evidence from any person if the Board finds that the testimony or production requested is not unduly burdensome and appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A subpoena under this subsection may be issued, and shall be enforced, in the same manner as applies in the case of subpoenas under section 1204.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Subject to the provisions of paragraph (2), in any case involving an alleged prohibited personnel practice as described under section 2302(b)(8), the Board shall order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate if the employee, former employee, or applicant for employment has demonstrated that a disclosure described under section 2302(b)(8) was a contributing factor in the personnel action which was taken or is to be taken against such employee, former employee, or applicant. The employee may demonstrate that the disclosure was a contributing factor in the personnel action through circumstantial evidence, such as evidence that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) A final order or decision shall be rendered by the Board as soon as practicable after the commencement of any proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A decision to terminate an investigation under subchapter II may not be considered in any action or other proceeding under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) If, based on evidence presented to it under this section, the Merit Systems Protection Board determines that there is reason to believe that a current employee may have committed a prohibited personnel practice, the Board shall refer the matter to the Special Counsel to investigate and take appropriate action under section 1215.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1)(A) If the Board orders corrective action under this section, such corrective action may include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) that the individual be placed, as nearly as possible, in the position the individual would have been in had the prohibited personnel practice not occurred; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) back pay and related benefits, medical costs incurred, travel expenses, and any other reasonable and foreseeable consequential changes.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:143 --><p class="statutory-body">(B) Corrective action shall include attorney's fees and costs as provided for under paragraphs (2) and (3).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) An employee, former employee, or applicant for employment adversely affected or aggrieved by a final order or decision of the Board under this section may obtain judicial review of the order or decision.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(i) Subsections (a) through (h) shall apply in any proceeding brought under section 7513(d) if, or to the extent that, a prohibited personnel practice as defined in section 2302(b)(8) is alleged.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) In determining the appealability of any case involving an allegation made by an individual under the provisions of this chapter, neither the status of an individual under any retirement system established under a Federal statute nor any election made by such individual under any such system may be taken into account.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Office of Personnel Management shall conduct the investigations and issue the reports required by the following statutes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) sections 272b, 281b(e), and 290a of title 22;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) section 1874(c) of title 42; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) section 1203(e) of title 6, District of Columbia Code.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When an investigation under subsection (a) of this section develops data indicating that the loyalty of the individual being investigated is questionable, the Office shall refer the matter to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for a full field investigation, a report of which shall be furnished to the Office for its information and appropriate action.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) When the President considers it in the national interest, he may have the investigations of a group or class, which are required by subsection (a) of this section, made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation rather than the Office.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The investigation and report required by subsection (a) of this section shall be made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation rather than the Office for those specific positions which the Secretary of State certifies are of a high degree of importance or sensitivity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) A revolving fund is available, to the Office without fiscal year limitation, for financing investigations, training, and such other functions as the Office is authorized or required to perform on a reimbursable basis, including personnel management services performed at the request of individual agencies (which would otherwise be the responsibility of such agencies), or at the request of nonappropriated fund instrumentalities. However, the functions which may be financed in any fiscal year by the fund are restricted to those functions which are covered by the budget estimates submitted to the Congress for that fiscal year. To the maximum extent feasible, each individual activity shall be conducted generally on an actual cost basis over a reasonable period of time.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The capital of the fund consists of the aggregate of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) appropriations made to provide capital for the fund, which appropriations are hereby authorized, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the sum of the fair and reasonable value of such supplies, equipment, and other assets as the Office from time to time transfers to the fund (including the amount of the unexpended balances of appropriations or funds relating to activities the financing of which is transferred to the fund) less the amount of related liabilities, the amount of unpaid obligations, and the value of accrued annual leave of employees, which are attributable to the activities the financing of which is transferred to the fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The fund shall be credited with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) advances and reimbursements from available funds of the Office or other agencies, or from other sources, for those services and supplies provided at rates estimated by the Office as adequate to recover expenses of operation (including provision for accrued annual leave of employees and depreciation of equipment); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) receipts from sales or exchanges of property, and payments for loss of or damage to property, accounted for under the fund.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any unobligated and unexpended balances in the fund which the Office determines to be in excess of amounts needed for activities financed by the fund shall be deposited in the Treasury of the United States as miscellaneous receipts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Office shall prepare a business-type budget providing full disclosure of the results of operations for each of the functions performed by the Office and financed by the fund, and such budget shall be transmitted to the Congress and considered, in the manner prescribed by law for wholly owned Government corporations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6) The Comptroller General of the United States shall, as a result of his periodic reviews of the activities financed by the fund, report and make such recommendations as he deems appropriate to the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) An agency may use available appropriations to reimburse the Office or the Federal Bureau of Investigation for the cost of investigations, training, and functions performed for them under this section, or to make advances toward their cost. These advances and reimbursements shall be credited directly to the applicable appropriations of the Office or the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>

<p class="note-body">Subsection (a) is based on section 1 of the Act of April 5, 1952, as amended, and is added for clarity. In subsection (a), the reference to section 10(b)(5)(B)(i) and (B)(ii) of the Act of August 1, 1946 (60 Stat. 766) is omitted because of the amendment of the Act of April 5, 1952, by the Act of July 31, 1953, ch. 283, 67 Stat. 240, and the reenactment of the provisions of the Act of April 5, 1952, insofar as they relate to the Atomic Energy Commission as section 145 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 942; 42 U.S.C. 2165).

Reference to section 510 of the Mutual Security Act of 1951 (65 Stat. 381) is omitted because this section was replaced by section 531 of the Mutual Security Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 859) and the latter was repealed by the Act of Sept. 4, 1961, Pub.

Plan No. 7, 67 Stat. 641, and Executive Order 10610 of May 9, 1955) are omitted because of the disposition of the two sections as explained with reference to subsection (a).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (e), the words &ldquo;There is established&rdquo; are omitted as executed.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (g), the reference to statutes other than this section is omitted because nothing in those statutes affect the responsibility in question.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) The Merit Systems Protection Board may require by subpena the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence relating to any matter before it as a result of this chapter. Any member of the Board may sign subpenas, and members of the Board and its examiners when authorized by the Board may administer oaths, examine witnesses, and receive evidence. The attendance of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence may be required from any place in the United States at the designated place of hearing. In case of disobedience to a subpena, the Board may invoke the aid of a court of the United States in requiring the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of documentary evidence. In case of contumacy or refusal to obey a subpena issued to a person, the United States District Court within whose jurisdiction the inquiry is carried on may issue an order requiring him to appear before the Board, or to produce documentary evidence if so ordered, or to give evidence concerning the matter in question; and any failure to obey the order of the court may be punished by the court as a contempt thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Board may order testimony to be taken by deposition at any stage of a proceeding or investigation before it as a result of this chapter. Depositions may be taken before an individual designated by the Board and having the power to administer oaths. Testimony shall be reduced to writing by the individual taking the deposition, or under his direction, and shall be subscribed by the deponent. Any person may be compelled to appear and depose and to produce documentary evidence before the Board as provided by this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A person may not be excused from attending and testifying or from producing documentary evidence or in obedience to a subpena on the ground that the testimony or evidence, documentary or otherwise required of him may tend to incriminate him or subject him to a penalty or forfeiture for or on account of any transaction, matter, or thing concerning which he is compelled to testify, or produce evidence, documentary or otherwise, before the Board in obedience to a subpena issued by it. A person so testifying is not exempt from prosecution and punishment for perjury committed in so testifying.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">A party aggrieved by a determination or order of the Merit Systems Protection Board under section 1504, 1505, or 1506 of this title may, within 30 days after the mailing of notice of the determination or order, institute proceedings for review thereof by filing a petition in the United States District Court for the district in which the State or local officer or employee resides. The institution of the proceedings does not operate as a stay of the determination or order unless&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the court specifically orders a stay; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the officer or employee is suspended from his office or employment while the proceedings are pending.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A copy of the petition shall immediately be served on the Board, and thereupon the Board shall certify and file in the court a transcript of the record on which the determination or order was made. The court shall review the entire record including questions of fact and questions of law. If application is made to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence, and it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the additional evidence may materially affect the result of the proceedings and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce this evidence in the hearing before the Board, the court may direct that the additional evidence be taken before the Board in the manner and on the terms and conditions fixed by the court. The Board may modify its findings of fact or its determination or order in view of the additional evidence and shall file with the court the modified findings, determination, or order; or the modified findings of fact, if supported by substantial evidence, are conclusive. The court shall affirm the determination or order, or the modified determination or order, if the court determines that it is in accordance with law. If the court determines that the determination or order, or the modified determination or order, is not in accordance with law, the court shall remand the proceeding to the Board with directions either to make a determination or order determined by the court to be lawful or to take such further proceedings as, in the opinion of the court, the law requires. The judgment and decree of the court are final, subject to review by the appropriate United States Court of Appeals as in other cases, and the judgment and decree of the court of appeals are final, subject to review by the Supreme Court of the United States on certiorari or certification as provided by section 1254 of title 28. If a provision of this section is held to be invalid as applied to a party by a determination or order of the Board, the determination or order becomes final and effective as to that party as if the provision had not been enacted.</p>
