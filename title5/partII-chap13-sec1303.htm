<p class="note-body">The authority of the President to prescribe rules is carried into sections 2951, 3302, 3304(a), 3306(a), 3321, 7152, 7153, 7321, and 7322 of this title.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (2), the words &ldquo;in respect to the execution of this act&rdquo; are changed to &ldquo;concerning the execution of the provisions of this title that relate to the administration of the competitive service&rdquo; to avoid having to refer in the text to the sections of this title into which the Civil Service Act, the act referred to, is codified. These sections are: 1101, 1102, 1105, 1302(a), 1303, 1307, 1308(a)(1), 2102, 2951, 3302, 3303, 3304(a), (d), 3305(a), 3306, 3318(a), 3319(a), 3321, 7152, 7153, 7321, 7322, and 7352. The words &ldquo;the provisions of this title that relate to the administration of the competitive service&rdquo; will include some of the sections derived from the Veterans&rsquo; Preference Act of 1944 (former sections 851&ndash;869). They are based in part on former section 860 (codified in &sect;1302(c)). The authorization in that section to make and enforce regulations for the competitive service would include the authority to investigate and report. The words &ldquo;and other employees&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;and its own subordinates, and those in the public service&rdquo; in view of the definition of &ldquo;employee&rdquo; in section 2105.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definition applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>
