<p class="statutory-body">(a) The days of leave provided by this subchapter are days on which an employee would otherwise work and receive pay and are exclusive of holidays and nonworkdays established by Federal statute, Executive order, or administrative order.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) For the purpose of this subchapter an employee is deemed employed for a full biweekly pay period if he is employed during the days within that period, exclusive of holidays and nonworkdays established by Federal statute, Executive order, or administrative order, which fall within his basic administrative workweek.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A part-time employee, unless otherwise excepted, is entitled to the benefits provided by subsection (d) of this section and sections 6303, 6304(a), (b), 6305(a), 6307, and 6310 of this title on a pro rata basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The annual leave provided by this subchapter, including annual leave that will accrue to an employee during the year, may be granted at any time during the year as the head of the agency concerned may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) If an officer excepted from this subchapter by section 6301(2)(x)&ndash;(xiii) of this title, without a break in service, again becomes subject to this subchapter on completion of his service as an excepted officer, the unused annual and sick leave standing to his credit when he was excepted from this subchapter is deemed to have remained to his credit.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) An employee who uses excess annual leave credited because of administrative error may elect to refund the amount received for the days of excess leave by lump-sum or installment payments or to have the excess leave carried forward as a charge against later-accruing annual leave, unless repayment is waived under section 5584 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) An employee who is being involuntarily separated from an agency due to a reduction in force or transfer of function under subchapter I of chapter 35 or section 3595 may elect to use annual leave to the employee's credit to remain on the agency's rolls after the date the employee would otherwise have been separated if, and only to the extent that, such additional time in a pay status will enable the employee to qualify for an immediate annuity under section 8336, 8412, 8414, or to qualify to carry health benefits coverage into retirement under section 8905(b).</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An employee is entitled to annual leave with pay which accrues as follows&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) one-half day for each full biweekly pay period for an employee with less than 3 years of service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) three-fourths day for each full biweekly pay period, except that the accrual for the last full biweekly pay period in the year is one and one-fourth days, for an employee with 3 but less than 15 years of service; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) one day for each full biweekly pay period for an employee with 15 or more years of service.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining years of service, an employee is entitled to credit for all service of a type that would be creditable under section 8332, regardless of whether or not the employee is covered by subchapter III of chapter 83, and for all service which is creditable by virtue of subsection (e). However, an employee who is a retired member of a uniformed service as defined by section 3501 of this title is entitled to credit for active military service only if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) his retirement was based on disability&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) resulting from injury or disease received in line of duty as a direct result of armed conflict; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body-block">The determination of years of service may be made on the basis of an affidavit of the employee. Leave provided by this subchapter accrues to an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods on the same basis as it would accrue if the employee were paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, an employee whose current employment is limited to less than 90 days is entitled to annual leave under this subchapter only after being currently employed for a continuous period of 90 days under successive appointments without a break in service. After completing the 90-day period, the employee is entitled to be credited with the leave that would have accrued to him under subsection (a) of this section except for this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) A change in the rate of accrual of annual leave by an employee under this section takes effect at the beginning of the pay period after the pay period, or corresponding period for an employee who is not paid on the basis of biweekly pay periods, in which the employee completed the prescribed period of service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of this subsection, the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe regulations under which, for purposes of determining years of service under subsection (a), credit shall, in the case of a newly appointed employee, be given for any prior service of such employee that would not otherwise be creditable for such purposes, if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) such service&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) was performed in a position the duties of which directly relate to the duties of the position to which such employee is so appointed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) meets such other requirements as the Office may prescribe; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the judgment of the head of the appointing agency, the application of this subsection is necessary in order to achieve an important agency mission or performance goal.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) An employee shall not be eligible for the application of paragraph (1) on the basis of any appointment if, within 90 days before the effective date of such appointment, such employee has held any position in the civil service.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the rate of accrual of annual leave under subsection (a) shall be 1 day for each full biweekly pay period in the case of any employee who holds a position which is subject to&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(d)(1) Annual leave which is lost by operation of this section because of&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the term &ldquo;Department of Defense emergency essential employee&rdquo; means an employee of the Department of Defense who is designated under section 1580 of title 10 as an emergency essential employee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the term &ldquo;combat zone&rdquo; has the meaning given such term in section 112(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Annual leave otherwise accruable after June 30, 1960, which is lost by operation of this section because of administrative error and which is not credited under subsection (d)(2) of this section because the employee is separated before the error is discovered, is subject to credit and liquidation by lump-sum payment only if a claim therefor is filed within 3 years immediately following the date of discovery of the error. Payment shall be made by the agency of employment when the lump-sum payment provisions of section 5551 of this title last became applicable to the employee at the rate of basic pay in effect on the date the lump-sum provisions became applicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) This subsection applies with respect to annual leave accrued by an individual while serving in&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a position in the Senior Executive Service;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) a position in the Senior Foreign Service;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;30 days&rdquo; in subsection (a) shall be deemed to read &ldquo;90 days&rdquo;; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The entitlement to leave under subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) based on the birth or placement of a son or daughter shall expire at the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date of such birth or placement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to section 6383, an employee who is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember shall be entitled to a total of 26 administrative workweeks of leave during a 12-month period to care for the servicemember.

<p class="statutory-body">(4) During the single 12-month period described in paragraph (3), an employee shall be entitled to a combined total of 26 administrative workweeks of leave under paragraphs (1) and (3).

An employee may elect to substitute for leave under subsection (a)(3) any of the employee's accrued or accumulated annual or sick leave under subchapter I for any part of the 26-week period of leave under such subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) In any case in which the necessity for leave under subparagraph (A) or (B) of subsection (a)(1) or under subsection (a)(3) is foreseeable based on an expected birth or placement, the employee shall provide the employing agency with not less than 30 days&rsquo; notice, before the date the leave is to begin, of the employee's intention to take leave under such subparagraph, except that if the date of the birth or placement requires leave to begin in less than 30 days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In any case in which the necessity for leave under subparagraph (C) or (D) of subsection (a)(1) or under subsection (a)(3) is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the employee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall make a reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employing agency, subject to the approval of the health care provider of the employee or the health care provider of the son, daughter, spouse, or parent of the employee, as appropriate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall provide the employing agency with not less than 30 days&rsquo; notice, before the date the leave is to begin, of the employee's intention to take leave under such subparagraph, except that if the date of the treatment requires leave to begin in less than 30 days, the employee shall provide such notice as is practicable.</p>
