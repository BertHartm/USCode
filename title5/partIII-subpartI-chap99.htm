<br class="Q04" />
<!-- PDFPage:1006 --><p class="statutory-body">(e) <cap-smallcap>Limitations Relating to Pay</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) Nothing in this section shall constitute authority to modify the pay of any employee who serves in an Executive Schedule position under subchapter II of chapter 53.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided for in paragraph (1), the total amount in a calendar year of allowances, differentials, bonuses, awards, or other similar cash payments paid under this title to any employee who is paid under section 5376 or 5383 or under title 10 or under other comparable pay authority established for payment of Department of Defense senior executive or equivalent employees may not exceed the total annual compensation payable to the Vice President under section 104 of title 3.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) <cap-smallcap>Provisions To Ensure Collaboration With Employee Representatives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) In order to ensure that the authority of this section is exercised in collaboration with, and in a manner that ensures the participation of, employee representatives in the planning, development, and implementation of the National Security Personnel System, the Secretary and the Director shall provide for the following:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) give such representatives at least 30 calendar days (unless extraordinary circumstances require earlier action) to review and make recommendations with respect to the proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) give any recommendations received from such representatives under clause (ii) full and fair consideration in deciding whether or how to proceed with the proposal.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Following receipt of recommendations, if any, from such employee representatives with respect to a proposal described in subparagraph (A), the Secretary and the Director shall accept such modifications to the proposal in response to the recommendations as they determine advisable and shall, with respect to any parts of the proposal as to which they have not accepted the recommendations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) notify Congress of those parts of the proposal, together with the recommendations of the employee representatives;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) meet and confer for not less than 30 calendar days with the employee representatives, in order to attempt to reach agreement on whether or how to proceed with those parts of the proposal; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(iii) at the Secretary's option, or if requested by a majority of the employee representatives participating, use the services of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service during such meet and confer period to facilitate the process of attempting to reach agreement.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) Any part of the proposal as to which the representatives do not make a recommendation, or as to which the recommendations are accepted by the Secretary and the Director, may be implemented immediately.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) With respect to any parts of the proposal as to which recommendations have been made but not accepted by the Secretary and the Director, at any time after 30 calendar days have elapsed since the initiation of the congressional notification, consultation, and mediation procedures set forth in subparagraph (B), if the Secretary, in his discretion, determines that further consultation and mediation is unlikely to produce agreement, the Secretary may implement any or all of such parts (including any modifications made in response to the recommendations as the Secretary determines advisable), but only after 30 days have elapsed after notifying Congress of the decision to implement the part or parts involved (as so modified, if applicable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) The Secretary shall notify Congress promptly of the implementation of any part of the proposal and shall furnish with such notice an explanation of the proposal, any changes made to the proposal as a result of recommendations from the employee representatives, and of the reasons why implementation is appropriate under this subparagraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) If a proposal described in subparagraph (A) is implemented, the Secretary and the Director shall&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1007 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) develop a method for the employee representatives to participate in any further planning or development which might become necessary; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) give the employee representatives adequate access to information to make that participation productive.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The Secretary may, at the Secretary's discretion, engage in any and all collaboration activities described in this subsection at an organizational level above the level of exclusive recognition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) In the case of any employees who are not within a unit with respect to which a labor organization is accorded exclusive recognition, the Secretary and the Director may develop procedures for representation by any appropriate organization which represents a substantial percentage of those employees or, if none, in such other manner as may be appropriate, consistent with the purposes of this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The procedures under this subsection are the exclusive procedures for the participation of employee representatives in the planning, development, implementation, or adjustment of the National Security Personnel System.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) For any bargaining unit so included under paragraph (1), the Secretary may bargain with a labor organization at an organizational level above the level of exclusive recognition. The decision to bargain at a level above the level of exclusive recognition shall not be subject to review or to statutory third-party dispute resolution procedures outside the Department of Defense. Any such bargaining shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be binding on all subordinate bargaining units of the labor organization at the level of recognition and their exclusive representatives, and the Department of Defense and its subcomponents, without regard to levels of recognition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) supersede all other collective bargaining agreements of the labor organization, including collective bargaining agreements negotiated with an exclusive representative at the level of recognition, except as otherwise determined by the Secretary;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) not be subject to further negotiations with the labor organizations for any purpose, including bargaining at the level of recognition, except as provided for by the Secretary; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The National Guard Bureau and the Army and Air Force National Guard are excluded from coverage under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any bargaining completed pursuant to this subsection with a labor organization not otherwise having national consultation rights with the Department of Defense or its subcomponents shall not create any obligation on the Department of Defense or its subcomponents to confer national consultation rights on such a labor organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) <cap-smallcap>Provisions Relating to Appellate Procedures</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may establish an appeals process that provides employees of the Department of Defense organizational and functional units that are included in the National Security Personnel System fair treatment in any appeals that they bring in decisions relating to their employment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall in prescribing regulations for any such appeals process&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(i) ensure that employees in the National Security Personnel System are afforded the protections of due process; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(ii) toward that end, be required to consult with the Merit Systems Protection Board before issuing any such regulations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Regulations implementing the appeals process may establish legal standards and procedures for personnel actions, including standards for applicable relief, to be taken on the basis of employee misconduct or performance that fails to meet expectations. Such standards shall be consistent with the public employment principles of merit and fitness set forth in section 2301.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Legal standards and precedents applied before the effective date of this section by the Merit Systems Protection Board and the courts under chapters 43, 75, and 77 of this title shall apply to employees of organizational and functional units included in the National Security Personnel System, unless such standards and precedents are inconsistent with legal standards established under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An employee who&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) is removed, suspended for more than 14 days, furloughed for 30 days or less, reduced in pay, or reduced in pay band (or comparable reduction) by a final decision under the appeals process established under paragraph (1);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) is not serving under probationary period as defined under regulations established under paragraph (2); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) would otherwise be eligible to appeal a performance-based or adverse action under chapter 43 or 75, as applicable, to the Merit Systems Protection Board,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">shall have the right to petition the full Merit Systems Protection Board for review of the record of that decision pursuant to regulations established under paragraph (2). The Board may dismiss any petition that, in the view of the Board, does not raise substantial questions of fact or law. No personnel action shall be stayed and no interim relief shall be granted during the pendency of the Board's review unless specifically ordered by the Board.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) The Board may order such corrective action as the Board considers appropriate only if the Board determines that the decision was&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) obtained without procedures required by law, rule, or regulation having been followed; or</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1008 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) unsupported by substantial evidence.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(6) An employee who is adversely affected by a final order or decision of the Board may obtain judicial review of the order or decision as provided in section 7703. The Secretary of Defense, after notifying the Director, may obtain judicial review of any final order or decision of the Board under the same terms and conditions as provided an employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(7) Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to authorize the waiver of any provision of law, including an appeals provision providing a right or remedy under section 2302(b) (1), (8) or (9), that is not otherwise waivable under subsection (a).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(8) The right of an employee to petition the Merit Systems Protection Board of the Department's final decision on an action covered by paragraph (4) of this subsection, and the right of the Merit Systems Protection Board to review such action or to order corrective action pursuant to paragraph (5), is provisional for 7 years after the date of the enactment of this chapter, and shall become permanent unless Congress acts to revise such provisions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) <cap-smallcap>Provisions Related to Separation and Retirement Incentives</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;(1) The Secretary may establish a program within the Department of Defense under which employees may be eligible for early retirement, offered separation incentive pay to separate from service voluntarily, or both. This authority may be used to reduce the number of personnel employed by the Department of Defense or to restructure the workforce to meet mission objectives without reducing the overall number of personnel. This authority is in addition to, and notwithstanding, any other authorities established by law or regulation for such programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) The Secretary may not authorize the payment of voluntary separation incentive pay under paragraph (1) to more than 25,000 employees in any fiscal year, except that employees who receive voluntary separation incentive pay as a result of a closure or realignment of a military installation under the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 (title XXIX of Public Law 101&ndash;510; 10 U.S.C. 2687 note) shall not be included in that number.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Secretary shall prepare a report each fiscal year setting forth the number of employees who received such pay as a result of a closure or realignment of a military base as described under subparagraph (A).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Secretary shall submit the report under subparagraph (B) to the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate, and the Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on Government Reform of the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For purposes of this section, the term &ldquo;employee&rdquo; means an employee of the Department of Defense, serving under an appointment without time limitation, except that such term does not include&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a reemployed annuitant under subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84, or another retirement system for employees of the Federal Government;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an employee having a disability on the basis of which such employee is or would be eligible for disability retirement under any of the retirement systems referred to in subparagraph (A); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) for purposes of eligibility for separation incentives under this section, an employee who is in receipt of a decision notice of involuntary separation for misconduct or unacceptable performance.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(4) An employee who is at least 50 years of age and has completed 20 years of service, or has at least 25 years of service, may, pursuant to regulations promulgated under this section, apply and be retired from the Department of Defense and receive benefits in accordance with chapter 83 or 84 if the employee has been employed continuously within the Department of Defense for more than 30 days before the date on which the determination to conduct a reduction or restructuring within 1 or more Department of Defense components is approved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Separation pay shall be paid in a lump sum or in installments and shall be equal to the lesser of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) an amount equal to the amount the employee would be entitled to receive under section 5595(c), if the employee were entitled to payment under such section; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) $25,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Separation pay shall not be a basis for payment, and shall not be included in the computation, of any other type of Government benefit. Separation pay shall not be taken into account for the purpose of determining the amount of any severance pay to which an individual may be entitled under section 5595, based on any other separation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Separation pay, if paid in installments, shall cease to be paid upon the recipient's acceptance of employment by the Federal Government, or commencement of work under a personal services contract as described in paragraph (6).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(6)(A) An employee who receives separation pay under such program may not be reemployed by the Department of Defense for a 12-month period beginning on the effective date of the employee's separation, unless this prohibition is waived by the Secretary on a case-by-case basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An employee who receives separation pay under this section on the basis of a separation occurring on or after the date of the enactment of the Federal Workforce Restructuring Act of 1994 (Public Law 103&ndash;236;&nbsp;<sup><a href="#9902_1_target" name="9902_1">1</a></sup> 108 Stat. 111) and accepts employment with the Government of the United States, or who commences work through a personal services contract with the United States within 5 years after the date of the separation on which payment of the separation pay is based, shall be required to repay the entire amount of the separation pay to the Department of Defense. If the employment is with an Executive agency (as defined by section 105) other than the Department of Defense, the Director may, at the request of the head of that agency, waive the repayment if the individual involved possesses unique abilities and is the only qualified applicant available for the position. If the employment is within the Department of De<!-- PDFPage:1009 -->fense, the Secretary may waive the repayment if the individual involved is the only qualified applicant available for the position.
