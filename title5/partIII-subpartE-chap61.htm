<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of each Executive agency, military department, and of the government of the District of Columbia shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) establish a basic administrative workweek of 40 hours for each full-time employee in his organization; and</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Except when the head of an Executive agency, a military department, or of the govern<!-- PDFPage:562 -->ment of the District of Columbia determines that his organization would be seriously handicapped in carrying out its functions or that costs would be substantially increased, he shall provide, with respect to each employee in his organization, that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) assignments to tours of duty are scheduled in advance over periods of not less than 1 week</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) the basic 40-hour workweek is scheduled on 5 days, Monday through Friday when possible, and the 2 days outside the basic workweek are consecutive;</p>

The words &ldquo;a military department&rdquo; are included to preserve the application of the source law. Before enactment of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 578), the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force were Executive departments. The National Security Act Amendments of 1949 established the Department of Defense as an Executive Department including the Department of the Army, the Department of the Navy, and the Department of the Air Force as military departments, not as Executive departments. However, the source law for this section which was in effect in 1949, remained applicable to the Secretaries of the military departments by virtue of section 12(g) of the National Security Act Amendments of 1949 (63 Stat. 591), which is set out in the reviser's note for section 301.</p>

(a)(1) Within 180 days after the effective date of this section, and subject to the requirements of section 302 and the terms of any written agreement referred to in section 302(a), the Commission shall establish a program which provides for the conducting of experiments by the Commission under titles I and II of this Act. Such experimental program shall cover a sufficient number of positions throughout the executive branch, and a sufficient range of worktime alternatives, as to provide an adequate basis on which to evaluate the effectiveness and desirability of permanently maintaining flexible or compressed work schedules within the executive branch.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Each agency may conduct one or more experiments under titles I and II of this Act. Such experiments shall be subject to such regulations as the Commission may prescribe under section 305 of this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) The Commission shall, not later than 90 days after the effective date of this section, establish a master plan which shall contain guidelines and criteria by which the Commission will study and evaluate experiments conducted under titles I and II of this Act.

Such request shall be accompanied by a report detailing the reasons for such determination.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Instead of a holiday that is designated under subsection (a) to occur on a Monday, for an employee at a duty post outside the United States whose basic workweek is other than Monday through Friday, and for whom Monday is a regularly scheduled workday, the legal public holiday is the first workday of the workweek in which the Monday designated for <!-- PDFPage:567 -->the observance of such holiday under subsection (a) occurs.</p>

The holiday for a full-time employee for whom the head of a department has established the first 40 hours of duty performed within a period of not more than six days of the administrative workweek as his basic workweek because of the impracticability of prescribing a regular schedule of definite hours of duty for each workday, shall be determined as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">(a) If a holiday occurs on Sunday, the head of the department shall designate in advance either Sunday or Monday as the employee's holiday and the employee's basic 40-hour tour of duty shall be deemed to include eight hours on the day designated as the employee's holiday.</p>
<p class="note-body">(b) If a holiday occurs on Saturday, the head of the department shall designate in advance either the Saturday or the preceding Friday as the employee's holiday and the employee's basic 40-hour tour of duty shall be deemed to include eight hours on the day designated as the employee's holiday.</p>
<p class="note-body">(c) If a holiday occurs on any other day of the week, that day shall be the employee's holiday, and the employee's basic 40-hour tour of duty shall be deemed to include eight hours on that day.</p>
<p class="note-body">(d) When a holiday is less than a full day, proportionate credit will be given under paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Expanding Family-Friendly Work Arrangements in Executive Branch</h4>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">In order to recruit and retain a Federal work force that will provide the highest quality of service to the American people, the executive branch must implement flexible work arrangements to create a &ldquo;family-friendly&rdquo; workplace. Broad use of flexible work arrangements to enable Federal employees to better balance their work and family responsibilities can increase employee effectiveness and job satisfaction, while decreasing turnover rates and absenteeism. I therefore adopt the National Performance Review's recommendation that a more family-friendly workplace be created by expanding opportunities for Federal workers to participate in flexible work arrangements, consistent with the mission of the executive branch to serve the public.</p>
<p class="note-body">The head of each executive department or agency (hereafter collectively &ldquo;agency&rdquo; or &ldquo;agencies&rdquo;) is hereby directed to establish a program to encourage and support the expansion of flexible family-friendly work arrangements, including: job sharing; career part-time employment; alternative work schedules; telecommuting and satellite work locations. Such a program shall include:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(1) identifying agency positions that are suitable for flexible work arrangements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(2) adopting appropriate policies to increase the opportunities for employees in suitable positions to participate in such flexible work arrangements;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(3) providing appropriate training and support necessary to implement flexible work arrangements; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">(4) identifying barriers to implementing this directive and providing recommendations for addressing such barriers to the President's Management Council.</p>
<p class="note-body">I direct the Director of the Office of Personnel Management (&ldquo;OPM&rdquo;) and the Administrator of General Services (&ldquo;GSA&rdquo;) to take all necessary steps to support and encourage the expanded implementation of flexible work arrangements. The OPM and GSA shall work in concert to promptly review and revise regulations that are barriers to such work arrangements and develop <!-- PDFPage:570 -->legislative proposals, as needed, to achieve the goals of this directive. The OPM and GSA also shall assist agencies, as requested, to implement this directive.</p>
<p class="note-body">The President's Management Council, in conjunction with the Office of Management and Budget, shall ensure that any guidance necessary to implement the actions set forth in this directive is provided.</p>
<p class="note-body">Independent agencies are requested to adhere to this directive to the extent permitted by law.</p>
<p class="note-body">This directive is for the internal management of the executive branch and is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable by a party against the United States, its agencies or instrumentalities, its officers or employees, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is authorized and directed to publish this directive in the Federal Register.</p>
