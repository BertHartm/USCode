<p class="statutory-body">(b) Subject to section 8435 of this title, any employee or Member who separates from Government employment is entitled and may elect to withdraw from the Thrift Savings Fund the balance of the employee's or Member's account as&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any combination of payments as provided under paragraphs (1) through (3) as the Executive Director may prescribe by regulation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) In addition to the right provided under subsection (b) to withdraw the balance of the account, an employee or Member who separates from Government service and who has not made a withdrawal under subsection (h)(1)(A) may make one withdrawal of any amount as a single payment in accordance with subsection (b)(2) from the employee's or Member's account.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) An employee or Member may request that the amount withdrawn from the Thrift Savings Fund in accordance with subsection (b)(2) be transferred to an eligible retirement plan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Executive Director shall make each transfer elected under paragraph (2) directly to an eligible retirement plan or plans (as defined in section 402(c)(8) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986) identified by the employee, Member, former employee, or former Member for whom the transfer is made.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A transfer may not be made for an employee, Member, former employee, or former Member under paragraph (2) until the Executive Director receives from that individual the information required by the Executive Director specifically to identify the eligible retirement plan or plans to which the transfer is to be made.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) A former employee or Member may not change an election under this section on or after the date on which a payment is made in accordance with such election or, in the case of an election to receive an annuity, the date on which an annuity contract is purchased to provide for the annuity elected by the former employee or Member.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e)(1) If an employee or Member (or former employee or Member) dies without having made an election under this section or after having elected an annuity under this section but before making an election under section 8434 of this title, an amount equal to the value of that individual's account (as of death) shall, subject to any decree, order, or agreement referred to in section 8435(c)(2) of this title be paid in a manner consistent with section 8424(d) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Notwithstanding section 8424(d), if an employee, Member, former employee, or former <!-- PDFPage:917 -->Member dies and has designated as sole or partial beneficiary his or her spouse at the time of death, or, if an employee, Member, former employee, or former Member, dies with no designated beneficiary and is survived by a spouse, the spouse may maintain the portion of the employee's or Member's account to which the spouse is entitled in accordance with the following terms:</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f)(1) Notwithstanding subsection (b), if an employee or Member separates from Government employment, and such employee's or Member's nonforfeitable account balance is less than an amount that the Executive Director prescribes by regulation, the Executive Director shall pay the nonforfeitable account balance to the participant in a single payment, unless an election under section 8432b(h)(2) is made to treat such separation for purposes of this paragraph as if it had never occurred.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Unless otherwise elected under this section, and subject to paragraph (1), benefits under this subchapter shall be paid as an annuity commencing for an employee, Member, former employee, or former Member on April 1 of the year following the latest of the year in which&mdash;</p>

The restrictions of section 8477(c)(1) of this title shall not apply to loans made under this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) A loan may not be made under this subsection to the extent that the loan would be treated as a taxable distribution under section 72(p) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) A loan may not be made under this subsection unless the requirements of section 8435(e) of this title are satisfied.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h)(1) An employee or Member may apply, before separation, to the Board for permission to withdraw an amount from the employee's or Member's account based upon&mdash;</p>
