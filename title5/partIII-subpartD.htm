<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It is the purpose of this chapter to provide a plan for classification of positions whereby&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in determining the rate of basic pay which an employee will receive&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the principle of equal pay for substantially equal work will be followed; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) variations in rates of basic pay paid to different employees will be in proportion to substantial differences in the difficulty, responsibility, and qualification requirements of the work performed and to the contributions of employees to efficiency and economy in the service; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) individual positions will, in accordance with their duties, responsibilities, and qualification requirements, be so grouped and identified by classes and grades, as defined by section 5102 of this title, and the various classes will be so described in published standards, as provided by section 5105 of this title, that the resulting position-classification system can be used in all phases of personnel administration.</p>

<p class="note-body">The section is reorganized and restated for clarity.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(i), the exception of &ldquo;a Government controlled corporation&rdquo; is added to preserve the application of this chapter to &ldquo;corporations wholly owned by the United States&rdquo;. This is necessary as the defined term &ldquo;Executive agency&rdquo; includes the defined term &ldquo;Government corporation&rdquo; and the latter includes both Government owned and controlled corporations. Thus the exclusion of Government controlled corporations, which are distinct from wholly owned corporations, operates to preserve the application of the chapter to wholly owned corporations.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(1)(vii), the words &ldquo;Panama Canal Company&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Panama Railroad Company&rdquo; on authority of the Act of Sept. 26, 1950, ch. 1049, &sect;2(a)(2), 64 Stat. 1038.</p>
<p class="note-body">The exception for the Inland Waterways Corporation in former section 1082(13) is omitted on authority of the Act of July 19, 1963, Pub. L. 88&ndash;67, 77 Stat. 81.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:331 --><p class="note-body">The exceptions for Production Credit Corporations and Federal Intermediate Credit Banks in former section 1082(18) and (19) are omitted as they are no longer &ldquo;corporations wholly owned by the United States&rdquo;. Under the Farm Credit Act of 1956, 70 Stat. 659, the Production Credit Corporations were merged in the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks, and pursuant to that Act the Federal Intermediate Credit Banks have ceased to be corporations wholly owned by the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body">Subsection (a)(2) is added for clarity. The reference to &ldquo;an individual employed in or under an agency&rdquo; includes both officers and employees of an agency.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (a)(5), the words &ldquo;in the General Schedule&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1091(3) to &ldquo;as specified in subchapter V of this chapter&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (b), the reference to former section 1085 is omitted as unnecessary. Former section 1085 which exempted certain agencies from former sections 1151&ndash;1153 is carried into section 305.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(1), the words &ldquo;chapter 45 of title 39&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(1) to &ldquo;chapter 23 of title 39&rdquo; on authority of the Act of July 10, 1955, ch. 137, &sect;805, 69 Stat. 130, and the Act of Sept. 2, 1960, Pub. L. 86&ndash;682, &sect;5, 74 Stat. 705.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(2)(B), the words &ldquo;this chapter&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(2)(B) to &ldquo;the Classification Act of 1923, as amended,&rdquo; on authority of section 1106 of the Act of Oct. 28, 1949, 63 Stat. 972, and technical section 7(b).</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(4), the words &ldquo;chapter 15 of title 31, District of Columbia Code&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(4) to &ldquo;the District of Columbia Teachers Salary Act of 1947, as supplemented by Public Law 151, Eighty-first Congress, approved June 30, 1949&rdquo; on authority of the provisions contained therein. The words &ldquo;District of Columbia Court of General Sessions&rdquo; and &ldquo;District of Columbia Court of Appeals&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Municipal Court for the District of Columbia&rdquo; and &ldquo;Municipal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia&rdquo;, respectively, on authority of D.C. Code &sect;&sect;11&ndash;902 and 11&ndash;702. The exception for judges of the Juvenile Court of the District of Columbia is based on D.C. Code &sect;11&ndash;1502.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(5), the word &ldquo;officers&rdquo; is omitted as included in &ldquo;member&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(10), the words &ldquo;sections 6952 and 7478 of title 10&rdquo;, &ldquo;section 7044 of title 10&rdquo;, and &ldquo;section 7043 of title 10&rdquo; are substituted for the references in former section 1082(10) to &ldquo;section 1071 of title 34&rdquo;, &ldquo;sections 1076&ndash;1076f of title 34&rdquo;, and &ldquo;section 1074 of title 34&rdquo;, respectively, on authority of the Act of Aug. 10, 1956, ch. 1041, &sect;49(b), 70A Stat. 640.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(11), the words &ldquo;the United States&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;the several States and the District of Columbia&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(14), the words &ldquo;employees necessary for the transaction of the business of the Service at canteens, warehouses, and storage depots whose employment is authorized by section 4202 of title 38&rdquo; are substituted for the reference in former section 1082(23) to &ldquo;positions which are exempt from this chapter, pursuant to section 4202 of title 38&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(16), the reference to &ldquo;section 4114 of title 38&rdquo; is substituted for the reference in former section 1082(25) to &ldquo;section 4114(b) of title 38&rdquo; to reflect the pay fixing authority contained in subsection (a)(1) of section 4114.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(22), the words &ldquo;as defined by section 901 of title 20&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;as defined in the Defense Department Overseas Teachers Pay and Personnel Practices Act&rdquo; on authority of former section 2351, which is scheduled for transfer to section 901 of title 20.</p>
<p class="note-body">In subsection (c)(25), the word &ldquo;schedule&rdquo; is omitted since section 603 of the Act of Oct. 11, 1962, Pub. L. 87&ndash;793, 76 Stat. 847, eliminated the necessity of referring to rates as scheduled or longevity. The words &ldquo;for GS&ndash;18&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;of the highest grade established by this chapter&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body">The second sentence of subsection (d) is based on former section 1084(c), which is carried into section 5103.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;Title I&mdash;Congressional Findings With Respect to Job Evaluation and Ranking in the Executive Branch</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 101. The Congress hereby finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the tremendous growth required in the activities of the Federal Government in order to meet the country's needs during the past several decades has led to the need for employees in an ever-increasing and changing variety of occupations and professions, many of which did not exist when the basic principles of job evaluation and ranking were established by the Classification Act of 1923 [Act Mar. 4, 1923, ch. 265, 42 Stat. 1488]. The diverse and constantly changing nature of these occupations and professions requires that the Federal Government reassess its approach to job evaluation and ranking better to fulfill its role as an employer and assure efficient economical administration;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the large number and variety of job evaluation and ranking systems in the executive branch have resulted in significant inequities in selection, promotion, and pay of employees in comparable positions among these systems;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) little effort has been made by Congress or the executive branch to consolidate or coordinate the various job evaluation and ranking systems, and there has been no progress toward the establishment of a coordinated system in which job evaluation and ranking, regardless of the methods used, is related to a unified set of principles providing coherence and equity throughout the executive branch;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) within the executive branch, there has been no significant study of, or experimentation with the several recognized methods of job evaluation and ranking to determine which of those methods are most appropriate for use and application to meet the present and future needs of the Federal Government; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) notwithstanding the recommendations resulting from the various studies conducted during the last twenty years, the Federal Government has not taken the initiative to implement those recommendations with respect to the job evaluation and ranking systems within the executive branch, with the result that such systems have not, in many cases, been adapted or administered to meet the rapidly changing needs of the Federal Government.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;Title II&mdash;Statement of Policy</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 201. It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the executive branch shall, in the interest of equity, efficiency, and good administration, operate under a coordinated job evaluation and ranking system for all civilian positions, to the greatest extent practicable;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the system shall be designed so as to utilize such methods of job evaluation and ranking as are appropriate for use in the executive branch, taking into account the various occupational categories of positions therein; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States Civil Service Commission shall be authorized to exercise general supervision and control over such a system.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Title III&mdash;Preparation of a Job Evaluation and Ranking Plan By the Civil Service Commission and Reports and Recommendations to Congress</cap-smallcap></h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 301. The Civil Service Commission, through such organizational unit which it shall establish within the Commission and which shall report directly to the Commission, shall prepare a comprehensive plan for the establishment of a coordinated system of job evaluation and ranking for civilian positions, in the executive branch. The plan shall include, among other things&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) provision for the establishment of a method or methods for evaluating jobs and alining them by level;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) a time schedule for the conversion of existing job evaluation and ranking systems into the coordinated system;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) provision that the Civil Service Commission shall have general supervision of and control over the coordinated job evaluation and ranking system, including, if the Commission deems it appropriate, the authority to approve or disapprove the adoption, use and administration in the executive branch of the method or methods established under that system;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) provision for the establishment of procedures for the periodic review by the Civil Service Commission of the effectiveness of the method or methods adopted for use under the system; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) provision for maintenance of the system to meet the changing needs of the executive branch in the future.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 302. In carrying out its functions under section 301 of this Act, the Commission shall consider all recognized methods of job evaluation and ranking.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 303. The Civil Service Commission is authorized to secure directly from any executive agency, as defined by section 105 of title 5, United States Code, or any bureau, office, or part thereof, information, suggestions, estimates, statistics, and technical assistance for the purposes of this Act; and each such executive agency or bureau, office, or part thereof is authorized and directed to furnish such information, suggestions, estimates, statistics, and technical assistance directly to the Civil Service Commission upon request by the Commission.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;<cap-smallcap>Sec</cap-smallcap>. 304. (a) Within one year after the date of enactment of this Act, the Commission shall submit to the President and the Congress an interim progress report on the current status and results of its activities under this Act, together with its current findings.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) Within two years after the date of enactment of this Act [Mar. 17, 1970]&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Civil Service Commission shall complete its functions under this Act and shall transmit to the President a comprehensive report of the result of its activities, together with its recommendations (including its draft of proposed legislation to carry out such recommendations), and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the President shall transmit that report (including the recommendations and draft of proposed legislation of the Commission) to the Congress, together with such recommendations as the President deems appropriate.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) Pay disparities shall be identified and reduced as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Comparability payments shall be payable within each locality determined to have a pay disparity greater than 5 percent.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:357 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2)(A) The localities having pay disparities, and the size of those disparities, shall, for purposes of any comparability payment scheduled to take effect in any calendar year, be determined in accordance with the appropriate report, as prepared and submitted to the President under subsection (d)(1) for purposes of such calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Any computation necessary to determine the size of the comparability payment to become payable for any locality in a year (as well as any determination as to the size of any pay disparity remaining after that comparability payment is made) shall likewise be made using data contained in the appropriate report (described in subparagraph (A)) so prepared and submitted for purposes of such calendar year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Subject to paragraph (4), the amount of the comparability payments payable under this subsection in a calendar year within any locality in which a comparability payment is payable shall be computed using such percentage as the President determines for such locality under subsection (d)(2), except that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the percentage for the first calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 1/5 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the percentage for the second calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 3/10 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the percentage for the third calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 2/5 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) the percentage for the fourth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than &frac12; of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the percentage for the fifth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 3/5 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) the percentage for the sixth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 7/10 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the percentage for the seventh calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 4/5 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) the percentage for the eighth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section may not be less than 9/10 of the amount needed to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the percentage for the ninth calendar year in which any amounts are payable under this section, and any year thereafter, may not be less than the full amount necessary to reduce the pay disparity of the locality involved to 5 percent.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Nothing in this section shall be considered to preclude the President, in his discretion, from adjusting comparability payments to a level higher than the minimum level otherwise required in a calendar year, including to the level necessary to eliminate a locality's pay disparity completely.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) After the ninth calendar year (referred to in subsection (a)(3)(I)), the level of comparability payments payable within such locality may be reduced for any subsequent calendar year, but only if, or to the extent that, the reduction would not immediately create another pay disparity in excess of 5 percent within the locality (taking into consideration any comparability payments remaining payable).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) The amount of the comparability payment payable within any particular locality during a calendar year&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be stated as a single percentage, which shall be uniformly applicable to General Schedule positions within the locality; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall, for any employee entitled to receive a comparability payment, be computed by applying that percentage to such employee's scheduled rate of basic pay (or, if lower due to a limitation on the rate payable, the rate actually payable), subject to subsection (g).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A comparability payment&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) shall be considered to be part of basic pay for purposes of retirement under chapter 83 or 84, as applicable, life insurance under chapter 87, and premium pay under subchapter V of chapter 55, and for such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) shall be paid in the same manner and at the same time as the basic pay payable to such employee pursuant to any provision of law outside of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Nothing in this subchapter shall be considered to permit or require that any portion of a comparability payment be taken into account for purposes of any adjustment under section 5303.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4)(A) Only employees receiving scheduled rates of basic pay (subject to any pay limitation which may apply) shall be eligible for comparability payments under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Comparability payments shall not be payable for service performed in any position which may not, under subsection (f)(1)(A), be included within a pay locality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) In order to carry out this section, the President shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) direct such agent as he considers appropriate to prepare and submit to him annually, after considering such views and recommendations as may be submitted under subsection (e) (but not later than 13 months before the start of the calendar year for purposes of which it is prepared), a report that&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) includes the views and recommendations submitted under subsection (e);</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Whenever the Office of Personnel Management finds that the Government's recruitment or retention efforts with respect to 1 or more occupations in 1 or more areas or locations are, or are likely to become, significantly handicapped due to any of the circumstances described in subsection (b), the Office may establish for the areas or locations involved, with respect to individuals in positions paid under any of the pay systems referred to in subsection (c), higher minimum rates of pay for 1 or more grades or levels, occupational groups, series, classes, or subdivisions thereof, and may make corresponding increases in all rates of the pay range for each such grade or level. However, a minimum rate so established may not exceed the maximum rate of basic pay (excluding any locality-based comparability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law) for the grade or level by more than 30 percent, and no rate may be established under this section in excess of the rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule. In the case of individuals not subject to the provisions of this title governing appointment in the competitive service, the President may designate another agency to authorize special rates under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The head of an agency may determine that a category of employees of the agency will not be covered by a special rate authorization established under this section. The head of an agency shall provide written notice to the Office of Personnel Management (or other agency designated by the President to authorize special rates under the last sentence of paragraph (1)) which identifies the specific category or categories of employees that will not be covered by special rates authorized under this section. If the head of an agency removes a category of employees from coverage under a special rate authorization after that authorization takes effect, the loss of coverage will take effect on the first day of the first pay period after the date of the notice.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The circumstances referred to in subsection (a) are&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) rates of pay offered by non-Federal employers being significantly higher than those payable by the Government within the area, location, occupational group, or other class of positions under the pay system involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the remoteness of the area or location involved;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the undesirability of the working conditions or the nature of the work involved (including exposure to toxic substances or other occupational hazards); or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) any other circumstances which the Office of Personnel Management (or such other agency as the President may under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1) designate) considers appropriate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Authority under subsection (a) may be exercised with respect to positions paid under&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a statutory pay system; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) any other pay system established by or under Federal statute for civilian positions within the executive branch.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Within the limitations applicable under the preceding provisions of this section, rates of pay established under this section may be revised from time to time by the Office of Personnel Management (or by such other agency as the President may designate under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1)). The actions and revisions have the force and effect of statute.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An increase in a rate of pay established under this section is not an equivalent increase in pay within the meaning of section 5335.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) When a schedule of special rates established under this section is adjusted under subsection (d), a covered employee's special rate will be adjusted in accordance with conversion rules prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (or by such other agency as the President may under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1) designate).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g)(1) The benefit of any comparability payments under section 5304 shall be available to individuals receiving rates of pay established under this section to such extent as the Office of Personnel Management (or such other agency as the President may under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1) designate) considers appropriate, subject to paragraph (2) and subsection (h).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Payments under this subsection may not be made if, or to the extent that, when added to basic pay otherwise payable, such payments would cause the total to exceed the rate of basic pay payable for level IV of the Executive Schedule.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) An employee shall not for any purpose be considered to be entitled to a rate of pay established under this section with respect to any period for which such employee is entitled to a higher rate of basic pay under any other provision of law. For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;basic pay&rdquo; includes any applicable locality-based comparability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) If an employee who is receiving a rate of pay under this section becomes subject, by virtue of moving to a new official duty station, to a different pay schedule, such employee's new rate of pay shall be initially established under conversion rules prescribed by the Office of Personnel Management (or such other agency as the <!-- PDFPage:368 -->President may under the last sentence of subsection (a)(1) designate) in conformance with the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) First, determine the rate of pay to which such employee would be entitled at the new official duty station based on such employee's position, grade, and step (or relative position in the rate range) before the move.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Then, if (in addition to the change in pay schedule) the move also involves any personnel action or other change requiring a rate adjustment under any other provision of law, rule, or regulation, apply the applicable rate adjustment provisions, treating the rate determined under paragraph (1) as if it were the rate last received by the employee before the rate adjustment.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(j) A rate determined under a schedule of special rates established under this section shall be considered to be part of basic pay for purposes of subchapter III of chapter 83, chapter 84, chapter 87, subchapter V of chapter 55, and section 5941, and for such other purposes as may be expressly provided for by law or as the Office of Personnel Management may by regulation prescribe.</p>

<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Assistant to the President and Chief of Staff [and] The Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">At a time when so many American families are struggling to make ends meet, I am committed to making sure the Federal Government is spending the taxpayers&rsquo; money wisely and carefully, and cutting costs wherever possible. I am committed to ending programs that do not work, streamlining those that do, and bringing a new responsibility for stewardship of tax dollars. Like households and businesses across the country, the Federal Government is tightening its belt. This effort began during my first days in office, when I froze the salaries of the senior members of my White House Staff.</p>
<p class="note-body">As a next step in this effort, I direct you to suspend cash awards, quality step increases, bonuses, and similar discretionary payments or salary adjustments to any politically appointed Federal employee, commencing immediately, and continuing through the end of Fiscal Year 2011. I also direct the Office of Personnel Management to issue guidance, in consultation with the Office of Management and Budget, to assist departments and agencies in implementing this policy.</p>
<p class="note-body">In addition to these actions freezing discretionary payments, I have proposed in my Budget for Fiscal Year 2011 a salary freeze for senior political appointees throughout the Federal Government. Unlike the administrative action I have taken today in this memorandum, my proposed salary freeze requires legislation, so it cannot be implemented absent legislative action by the Congress.</p>
<p class="note-body">I appreciate the hard work of our Federal workforce, and understand how important these payments can be <!-- PDFPage:373 -->to many workers and their families. Yet like households and businesses across the country, we need to make tough choices about how to spend our funds.</p>
<p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law and consistent with executive departments&rsquo; and agencies&rsquo; legal authorities. Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to affect payments or salary adjustments for Federal employees who are not political appointees. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="note-body">The proviso in paragraph (15) of former section 2211(b) is carried into section 5314. The remainder of paragraph (15) is omitted but not repealed, see table III. The part of paragraph (15) that is omitted but not repealed provides that the position of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall be in Level II of the Federal Executive Salary Schedule so long as the position is held by the incumbent of the position on August 14, 1964. The omission of this provision from title 5, without repealing the corresponding provision of the source statute, in effect leaves existing statute unchanged insofar as it relates to the present incumbent of the position of Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>

<p class="note-body">The provisos in paragraphs (39) and (46) of former section 2211(c) are carried into section 5315. The remainders of paragraphs (39) and (46) are omitted but not repealed, see table III. The parts of paragraphs (39) and (46) that are omitted but not repealed provide that the positions of Director of Selective Service and Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall be in Level III so long as the positions are held by the incumbents of the positions on August 14, 1964. The omission of these provisions from title 5, without repealing the corresponding provisions of the source statute, in effect, leaves existing statute unchanged insofar as it relates to the present incumbents of the positions of Director of Selective Service and Associate Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</p>
<p class="note-body">Standard changes are made to conform with the definitions applicable and the style of this title as outlined in the preface to the report.</p>

<p class="note-body">The deletion of paragraph (41) of 5 U.S.C. 5314 reflects the abolition of the position of &ldquo;Deputy Administrator of the Housing and Home Finance Agency&rdquo; by the act of September 9, 1965, Public Law 89&ndash;174, sections 5(a), 9(c), 79 Stat. 669, 671.</p>
<p class="note-body">In paragraph (49), the words &ldquo;In lieu of receiving compensation at the rate prescribed by section 785(c) of this title&rdquo; are omitted since the provisions of 20 U.S.C. 785(c) relating to compensation are repealed by this bill; also see table II. The wording further reflects the first sentence of 20 U.S.C. 954(d), and conforms to 5 U.S.C. 5314 which applies to positions rather than individuals.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Freezing Federal Employee Pay Schedules and Rates That Are Set by Administrative Discretion</h4>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum of President of the United States, Dec. 22, 2010, 75 F.R. 81829, provided:</p>
<p class="note-body">Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies</p>
<p class="note-body">On November 29, 2010, I proposed a two-year freeze in the pay of civilian Federal employees as the first of a number of difficult actions required to put our Nation on a sound fiscal footing. As I said then, Federal workers are not just a line in a budget. They are public servants who, like their private sector counterparts, may be struggling in these difficult economic times.</p>
<p class="note-body">Despite the sacrifices that I knew a pay freeze would entail for our dedicated civil servants, I concluded that a two-year freeze in the upward statutory adjustment of pay schedules is a necessary first step in our effort to address the challenge of our fiscal reality. The Congress responded to my proposal by including such a freeze in the Continuing Appropriations and Surface Transportation Extensions Act, 2011 (H.R. 3082) [Pub. L. 111&ndash;322], which I signed into law today (the &ldquo;Act&rdquo;). The Act freezes statutory pay adjustments for all executive branch pay schedules for a two-year period. It also generally prohibits executive departments and agencies from providing any base salary increases at all to senior executives or senior level employees, including performance-based increases.</p>
<p class="note-body">While this legislation will prevent adjustments in executive branch pay schedules that are made by statute, some laws allow such adjustments to be made by agency heads as an exercise of administrative discretion. In order to ensure consistent treatment of executive branch employees and to promote the fiscal purposes of my original proposal, agency heads who have such discretion should not provide any upward adjustments in Federal employees&rsquo; pay schedules or rates during the two-year period covered by the statutory pay freeze.</p>
<p class="note-body">Accordingly, you should suspend any increases to any pay systems or pay schedules covering executive branch employees that could otherwise take effect as a result of an exercise of administrative discretion during the period beginning on January 1, 2011, and ending on December 31, 2012. You also should forgo any general increases (including general increases for a geographic area, such as locality pay) in covered employees&rsquo; rates of pay that could otherwise take effect as a result of the exercise of administrative discretion during the same period. To the extent that an agency pay system provides performance-based increases in lieu of general increases, funds allocated for those performance-based increases should be correspondingly reduced to reflect the freezing of the employees&rsquo; base pay schedule.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:417 --><p class="note-body">This memorandum shall be carried out to the extent permitted by law and consistent with executive departments&rsquo; and agencies&rsquo; legal authorities. This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.</p>
<p class="note-body">The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall issue guidance on implementing this memorandum, and is also hereby authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) An employee who is promoted or transferred to a position in a higher grade is entitled <!-- PDFPage:418 -->to basic pay at the lowest rate of the higher grade which exceeds his existing rate of basic pay by not less than two step-increases of the grade from which he is promoted or transferred.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5514. Installment deduction for indebtedness to the United States</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) When the head of an agency or his designee determines that an employee, member of the Armed Forces or Reserve of the Armed Forces, is indebted to the United States for debts to which the United States is entitled to be repaid at the time of the determination by the head of an agency or his designee, or is notified of such a debt by the head of another agency or his designee the amount of indebtedness may be collected in monthly installments, or at officially established pay intervals, by deduction from the current pay account of the individual. The deductions may be made from basic pay, special pay, incentive pay, retired pay, retainer pay, or, in the case of an individual not entitled to basic pay, other authorized pay. The amount deducted for any period may not exceed 15 percent of disposable pay, except that a greater percentage may be deducted upon the written consent of the individual involved. If the individual retires or resigns, or if his employment or period of active duty otherwise ends, before collection of the amount of the indebtedness is completed, deduction shall be made from subsequent payments of any nature due the individual from the agency concerned. All Federal agencies to which debts are owed and which have outstanding delinquent debts shall participate in a computer match at least annually of their delinquent debt records with records of Federal employees to identify those employees who are delinquent in repayment of those debts. The preceding sentence shall not apply to any debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. Matched Federal employee records shall include, but shall not be limited to, records of active Civil Service employees government-wide, military active duty personnel, military reservists, United States Postal Service employees, employees of other government corporations, and seasonal and temporary employees. The Secretary of the Treasury shall establish and maintain an interagency consortium to implement centralized salary offset computer matching, and promulgate regulations for this program. Agencies that perform centralized salary offset computer matching services under this subsection are authorized to charge a fee sufficient to cover the full cost for such services.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Except as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection, prior to initiating any proceedings under paragraph (1) of this subsection to collect any indebtedness of an individual, the head of the agency holding the debt or his designee, shall provide the individual with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a minimum of thirty days written notice, informing such individual of the nature and amount of the indebtedness determined by such agency to be due, the intention of the agency to initiate proceedings to collect the debt through deductions from pay, and an explanation of the rights of the individual under this subsection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) an opportunity to inspect and copy Government records relating to the debt;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) an opportunity to enter into a written agreement with the agency, under terms agreeable to the head of the agency or his designee, to establish a schedule for the repayment of the debt; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) an opportunity for a hearing on the determination of the agency concerning the existence or the amount of the debt, and in the case of an individual whose repayment schedule is established other than by a written agreement pursuant to subparagraph (C), concerning the terms of the repayment schedule.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">A hearing, described in subparagraph (D), shall be provided if the individual, on or before the fifteenth day following receipt of the notice described in subparagraph (A), and in accordance with such procedures as the head of the agency may prescribe, files a petition requesting such a hearing. The timely filing of a petition for hearing shall stay the commencement of collection proceedings. A hearing under subparagraph (D) may not be conducted by an individual under the supervision or control of the head of the <!-- PDFPage:461 -->agency, except that nothing in this sentence shall be construed to prohibit the appointment of an administrative law judge. The hearing official shall issue a final decision at the earliest practicable date, but not later than sixty days after the filing of the petition requesting the hearing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Paragraph (2) shall not apply to routine intra-agency adjustments of pay that are attributable to clerical or administrative errors or delays in processing pay documents that have occurred within the four pay periods preceding the adjustment and to any adjustment that amounts to $50 or less, if at the time of such adjustment, or as soon thereafter as practical, the individual is provided written notice of the nature and the amount of the adjustment and a point of contact for contesting such adjustment.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) The collection of any amount under this section shall be in accordance with the standards promulgated pursuant to sections 3711 and 3716&ndash;3718 of title 31 or in accordance with any other statutory authority for the collection of claims of the United States or any agency thereof.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) For purposes of this subsection&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) &ldquo;disposable pay&rdquo; means that part of pay of any individual remaining after the deduction from those earnings of any amounts required by law to be withheld; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) &ldquo;agency&rdquo; includes executive departments and agencies, the United States Postal Service, the Postal Regulatory Commission, any nonappropriated fund instrumentality described in section 2105(c) of this title, the United States Senate, the United States House of Representatives, and any court, court administrative office, or instrumentality in the judicial or legislative branches of the Government, and government corporations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) The head of each agency shall prescribe regulations, subject to the approval of the President, to carry out this section and section 3530(d) of title 31. Regulations prescribed by the Secretaries of the military departments shall be uniform for the military services insofar as practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) For purposes of section 7117(a) of this title, no regulation prescribed to carry out subsection (a)(2) of this section shall be considered to be a Government-wide rule or regulation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) Subsection (a) of this section does not modify existing statutes which provide for forfeiture of pay or allowances. This section and section 3530(d) of title 31 do not repeal, modify, or amend section 4837(d) or 9837(d) of title 10 or section 1007(b), (c) of title 37.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) A levy pursuant to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall take precedence over other deductions under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) An employee of a nonappropriated fund instrumentality described in section 2105(c) of this title is deemed an employee covered by this section.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Historical and Revision Notes</h4>
<p class="note-body">This section amends chapter 55 of title 5, United States Code, by inserting a new section 5534a. This section is based on subsections (a) and (f) of former 5 U.S.C. 61a&ndash;1 the source statute for which (act of Nov. 21, 1945, ch. 489, 59 Stat. 584) was repealed by the act of September 6, 1966, Public Law 89&ndash;554 (sec. 8, 80 Stat. 653). Senate Report 1380, 89th Congress, second session, pages 449, 511, explains that the source was repealed since it had been rendered obsolete by section 4(c) of the Armed Forces Leave Act of 1946, as amended (37 U.S.C. 501), and section 219(c) of the Public Health Service Act, as added August 9, 1950 (ch. 654, sec. 2, 64 Stat. 426; 42 U.S.C. 210&ndash;1(c)), and that any existing rights are preserved by section 8 of Public Law 89&ndash;554.</p>
<p class="note-body">At the time of enactment of the act of November 21, 1945, there was no authority to make lump-sum leave payments to members of the uniformed services who were being separated from or released from active duty in the uniformed services. Accordingly, they were placed on terminal leave until the expiration of the unused portion of their accumulated and current accrued leave, and only then separated or released. The act of November 21, 1945, in part, authorized the employment of these members during terminal leave and provided they were entitled to receive, in addition to the payment from the employment, military pay and allowances for the unexpired portion of the terminal leave. The Armed Forces Leave Act of 1946 authorized lump-sum leave payments of unused accumulated and current accrued leave. Generally, thereafter, members of the uniformed services were not placed on terminal leave, but were separated and paid a lump-sum leave payment. However, in certain instances a member may be placed on terminal leave. Such a case was considered recently by the Comptroller General of the United States (see B&ndash;157500, Oct. 13, 1965, 45 Comp. Gen. 180. In <!-- PDFPage:478 -->view of the foregoing, it is concluded that subsection (a) of former 5 U.S.C. 61a&ndash;1 had prospective effect and should have been reenacted in title 5, U.S.C., by Public Law 89&ndash;554.</p>
<p class="note-body">In section 5534a, the words &ldquo;A member of a uniformed service who has performed active service&rdquo; are substituted for &ldquo;Any person, who, shall have performed active service in the Armed Forces&rdquo; to conform to the style of title 5 and the definition of &ldquo;uniformed services&rdquo; in 5 U.S.C. 2101 which is coextensive with the definition of &ldquo;armed forces&rdquo; in subsection (f) of former 5 U.S.C. 61a&ndash;1. Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965 (79 Stat. 1318), effective July 13, 1965, consolidated the Coast and Geodetic Survey and the Weather Bureau to form a new agency in the Department of Commerce to be known as the Environmental Science Services Administration. The words &ldquo;subsequent to May 1, 1940&rdquo; are omitted as executed. The word &ldquo;territories&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;Territories&rdquo; inasmuch as there now are no incorporated territories. The words &ldquo;(including any corporation created under authority of an act of Congress which is either wholly controlled or wholly owned by the Government of the United States, or any department, agency, or establishment thereof, whether or not the employees thereof are paid from funds appropriated by Congress)&rdquo; are omitted as included in &ldquo;a civilian office or position in the Government of the United States&rdquo;. The word &ldquo;pay&rdquo; is substituted for &ldquo;compensation.&rdquo;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;5544. Wage-board overtime and Sunday rates; computation</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) An employee whose pay is fixed and adjusted from time to time in accordance with prevailing rates under section 5343 or 5349 of this title, or by a wage board or similar administrative authority serving the same purpose, is entitled to overtime pay for overtime work in excess of 8 hours a day or 40 hours a week. However, an employee subject to this subsection who regularly is required to remain at or within the confines of his post of duty in excess of 8 hours a day in a standby or on-call status is entitled to overtime pay only for hours of duty, exclusive of eating and sleeping time, in excess of 40 a week. The overtime hourly rate of pay is computed as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on a basis other than an annual or monthly basis, multiply the basic hourly rate of pay by not less than one and one-half.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on an annual basis, divide the basic annual rate of pay by 2,087, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If the basic rate of pay of the employee is fixed on a monthly basis, multiply the basic monthly rate of pay by 12 to derive a basic annual rate of pay, divide the basic annual rate of pay by 2,087, and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">An employee subject to this subsection whose regular work schedule includes an 8-hour period of service a part of which is on Sunday is entitled to additional pay at the rate of 25 percent of his hourly rate of basic pay for each hour of work performed during that 8-hour period of service. For employees serving outside the United States in areas where Sunday is a routine workday and another day of the week is officially recognized as the day of rest and worship, the Secretary of State may designate the officially recognized day of rest and worship as the day with respect to which the preceding sentence shall apply instead of Sunday. Time spent in a travel status away from the official duty station of an employee subject to this sub<!-- PDFPage:487 -->section is not hours of work unless the travel (i) involves the performance of work while traveling, (ii) is incident to travel that involves the performance of work while traveling, (iii) is carried out under arduous conditions, or (iv) results from an event which could not be scheduled or controlled administratively (including travel by the employee to such event and the return of the employee from such event to the employee's official duty station). The first and third sentences of this subsection shall not be applicable to an employee who is subject to the overtime pay provisions of section 7 of the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938.

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Except as provided by subsection (b) of this section, nightwork is regularly scheduled work between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m., and includes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) periods of absence with pay during these hours due to holidays; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) periods of leave with pay during these hours if the periods of leave with pay during a pay period total less than 8 hours.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Except as otherwise provided by subsection (c) of this section, an employee is entitled to pay for nightwork at his rate of basic pay plus premium pay amounting to 10 percent of that basic rate. This subsection and subsection (b) of this section do not modify section 5141 of title 31, or other statute authorizing additional pay for nightwork.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b) The head of an agency may designate a time after 6:00 p.m. and a time before 6:00 a.m. as the beginning and end, respectively, of nightwork for the purpose of subsection (a) of this section, at a post outside the United States where the customary hours of business extend into the hours of nightwork provided by subsection (a) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The head of an agency, with the approval of the Office of Personnel Management, may provide that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) an employee in a position requiring him regularly to remain at, or within the confines of, his station during longer than ordinary periods of duty, a substantial part of which consists of remaining in a standby status rather than performing work, shall receive premium pay for this duty on an annual basis instead of premium pay provided by other provisions of this subchapter, except for irregular, unscheduled overtime duty in excess of his regularly scheduled weekly tour. Premium pay under this paragraph is determined as an appropriate percentage, not in excess of 25 percent, of such part of the rate of basic pay for the position as does not exceed the minimum rate of basic pay for GS&ndash;10 (including any applicable locality-based comparability payment under section 5304 or similar provision of law and any applicable special rate of pay under section 5305 or similar provision of law) (or, for a position described in section 5542(a)(3) of this title, of the basic pay of the position), by taking into consideration the number of hours of actual work required in the position, the number of hours required in a standby status at or within the confines of the station, the extent to which the duties of the position are made more onerous by night, Sunday, or holiday work, or by being extended over periods of more than 40 hours a week, and other relevant factors; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) an employee in a position in which the hours of duty cannot be controlled administratively, and which requires substantial amounts of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty with the employee generally being responsible for recognizing, without supervision, circumstances which require the employee to remain on duty, shall receive premium pay for this duty on an annual basis instead of premium pay provided by other provisions of this subchapter, except for regularly scheduled overtime, night, and Sunday duty, and for holiday duty. Premium pay under this paragraph is an appropriate percentage, not less than 10 percent nor more than 25 percent, of the rate of basic pay for the position, as determined by taking into consideration the frequency and duration of irregular, unscheduled overtime duty required in the position.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(d) The Office shall establish a schedule or schedules of pay differentials for duty involving unusual physical hardship or hazard, and for any hardship or hazard related to asbestos, such differentials shall be determined by applying occupational safety and health standards consistent with the permissible exposure limit promulgated by the Secretary of Labor under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Under such regulations as the Office may prescribe, and for such minimum periods as it determines appropriate, an employee to whom chapter 51 and subchapter III of chapter 53 of this title applies is entitled to be paid the appropriate differential for any period in which he is subjected to physical hardship or hazard not usually involved in carrying out the duties of his position. However, the pay differential&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) does not apply to an employee in a position the classification of which takes into account the degree of physical hardship or hazard involved in the performance of the duties thereof, except in such circumstances as the Office may by regulation prescribe; and</p>

Specifically, 5 U.S.C. 5544(a) is based in part on section 23 (2d proviso) of the act of March 28, 1934, as amended by 76 <!-- PDFPage:497 -->Stat. 360; and 5 U.S.C. 5545(d) is based on section 804 of the Classification Act of 1949, as added by Public Law 89&ndash;512, 80 Stat. 318.

The lump-sum payment shall equal the pay (excluding any differential under section 5925 and any allowance under section 5928) the employee or individual would have received had he remained in the service until expiration of the period of the annual or vacation leave. The lump-sum payment is considered pay for taxation purposes only. The period of leave used for calculating the lump-sum payment shall not be extended due to any holiday occurring after separation.

<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Annual leave that is restored to an employee of the Department of Defense under section 6304(d) of this title by reason of the operation of paragraph (3) of such section and remains unused upon the transfer of the employee to a position described in paragraph (2) shall be liquidated by payment of a lump-sum for such leave to the employee upon the transfer.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) A position referred to in paragraph (1) is a position in a department or agency of the Federal Government outside the Department of Defense or a Department of Defense position that is not located at a Department of Defense installation being closed or realigned as described in section 6304(d)(3) of this title.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) Transportation (including packing, crating, draying, temporarily storing, and unpacking of household and personal effects) may be provided for the dependents and household and personal effects of an employee in active service (without regard to pay grade) who is officially reported as dead, injured, or absent for more than 29 days in a status listed in section 5561(5) (A)&ndash;(E) of this title to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the official residence of record for the employee;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) When an employee described in subsection (b) of this section is in an injured status, trans<!-- PDFPage:505 -->portation of dependents and household and personal effects may be provided under this section only when prolonged hospitalization or treatment is anticipated.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) Transportation on request of a dependent may be authorized under this section only when there is a reasonable relationship between the circumstances of the dependent and the destination requested.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) Instead of providing transportation for dependents under this section, when the travel has been completed the head of the agency concerned may authorize&mdash;</p>

The cost of the storage and transportation (including packing, crating, draying, temporarily storing, and unpacking) of household and personal effects shall be charged against appropriations currently available.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) When the head of the agency concerned determines that an emergency exists and that a sale would be in the best interests of the United States, he may provide for the public or private sale of motor vehicles and other bulky items of the household and personal effects of an employee described in subsection (b) of this section. Before a sale, and if practicable, a reasonable effort shall be made to determine the desires of interested persons. The net proceeds from the sale shall be sent to the owner or other person entitled thereto under regulations prescribed by the head of the agency concerned.

When a claim is filed, the Administrator of General Services shall allow or disallow it. A claim that is allowed shall be paid from the appropriation for refunding money erroneously received and covered. If a claim is not filed before the end of 5 years from the date the proceeds are covered into the Treasury, it is barred from being acted on by the Administrator of General Services or the courts.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may make any determination necessary to administer this subchapter, and when so made it is conclusive as to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) death or finding of death;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the fact of dependency under this subchapter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) any other status covered by this subchapter;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:507 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) an essential date, including one on which evidence or information is received by the head of the agency concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whether information received concerning an employee is to be construed and acted on as an official report of death.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) When the head of the agency concerned receives information that he considers to conclusively establish the death of an employee, he shall take action thereon as an official report of death, notwithstanding an earlier action relating to death or other status of the employee. After the end of 12 months in a missing status prescribed by section 5565 of this title, the head of the agency concerned or his designee shall make a finding of death when he considers that the information received, or a lapse of time without information, establishes a reasonable presumption that an employee in a missing status is dead.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may determine the entitlement of an employee to pay and allowances under this subchapter, including credits and charges in his account, and that determination is conclusive. An account may not be charged or debited with an amount that an employee captured, beleaguered, or besieged by a hostile force may receive or be entitled to receive from, or have placed to his credit by, the hostile force as pay, allowances, or other compensation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When circumstances warrant the reconsideration of a determination made under this subchapter, the head of the agency concerned or his designee may change or modify it.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When the account of an employee has been charged or debited with an allotment paid under this subchapter, the amount so charged or debited shall be recredited to the account of the employee if the head of the agency concerned or his designee determines that the payment was induced by fraud or misrepresentation to which the employee was not a party.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) Except an allotment for an unearned insurance premium, an allotment paid from the pay and allowances of an employee for the period he is in a missing status may not be collected from the allottee as an overpayment when payment was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death. An allotment paid for a period after the end, under this subchapter or otherwise, of entitlement to pay and allowances may not be collected from the allottee or charged against the pay of a deceased employee when payment was caused by delay in receiving evidence of death.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The head of the agency concerned or his designee may waive the recovery of an erroneous payment or overpayment of an allotment to a dependent if he considers recovery is against equity and good conscience.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) For the purpose of determining status under this section, a dependent of an employee in active service is deemed an employee. A determination under this section made by the head of the agency concerned or his designee is conclusive on all other agencies of the United States. This section does not entitle a dependent to pay, allowances, or other compensation to which he is not otherwise entitled.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a)(1) Under regulations prescribed pursuant to section 5707 of this title, an employee, when traveling on official business away from the employee's designated post of duty, or away from the employee's home or regular place of business (if the employee is described in section 5703 of this title), is entitled to any one of the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) a per diem allowance at a rate not to exceed that established by the Administrator of General Services for travel within the continental United States, and by the President or his designee for travel outside the continental United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) reimbursement for the actual and necessary expenses of official travel not to exceed an amount established by the Administrator for travel within the continental United States or an amount established by the President or his designee for travel outside the continental United States; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) a combination of payments described in subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Any per diem allowance or maximum amount of reimbursement shall be established, to the extent feasible, by locality.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) For travel consuming less than a full day, the payment prescribed by regulation shall be allocated in such manner as the Administrator may prescribe.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(b)(1) Under regulations prescribed pursuant to section 5707 of this title, an employee who is described in subsection (a) of this section and who abandons the travel assignment prior to its completion&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) because of an incapacitating illness or injury which is not due to the employee's own misconduct is entitled to reimbursement for expenses of transportation to the employee's designated post of duty, or home or regular place of business, as the case may be, and to payments pursuant to subsection (a) of this section until that location is reached; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) because of a personal emergency situation (such as serious illness, injury, or death of a member of the employee's family, or an emergency situation such as fire, flood, or act of God), may be allowed, with the approval of an appropriate official of the agency concerned, reimbursement for expenses of transportation to the employee's designated post of duty, or home or regular place of business, as the case may be, and payments pursuant to subsection (a) of this section until that location is reached.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) Under regulations prescribed pursuant to section 5707 of this title, an employee who is described in subsection (a) of this section and who, with the approval of an appropriate official of the agency concerned, interrupts the travel assignment prior to its completion for a reason specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection, may be allowed (subject to the limitation provided in subparagraph (B) of this paragraph)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) reimbursement for expenses of transportation to the location where necessary medical services are provided or the emergency situation exists,</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(B) The reimbursement which an employee may be allowed pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be the employee's actual costs of transportation to the location where necessary medical services are provided or the emergency exists, and return to assignment from such location, less the costs of transportation which the employee would have incurred had such travel begun and ended at the employee's designated post of duty, or home or regular place of business, as the case may be. The payments which an employee may be allowed pursuant to subparagraph (A) of this paragraph shall be based on the additional time (if any) which was required for the employee's transportation as a consequence of the transportation's having begun and ended at a location on the travel assignment (rather than at the employee's designated post of duty, or home or regular place of business, as the case may be).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Subject to the limitations contained in regulations prescribed pursuant to section 5707 of this title, an employee who is described in subsection (a) of this section and who interrupts the travel assignment prior to its completion because of an incapacitating illness or injury which is not due to the employee's own misconduct is entitled to payments pursuant to subsection (a) of this section at the location where the interruption occurred.</p>

Advances of funds may be made for the expenses authorized by this subsection to the extent authorized by section 5724(f) of this title. In the case of an appointee described in paragraph (1) who has performed transition activities under section 3 of the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note), the provisions of paragraphs (1) and (2) may apply to travel and transportation expenses from the place of residence of such appointee (at the time of relocation following the most recent general elections held to determine the electors of the President) to the assigned duty station of such appointee.</p>

If the individual violates the agreement, the money spent by the Government for the expenses is recoverable from the individual as a debt due the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(c) An agency may pay travel and transportation expenses under subsection (a) of this section whether or not the individual selected has been appointed at the time of the travel. In the case of an appointee described in subsection (a)(1) who has performed transition activities under section 3 of the Presidential Transition Act of 1963 (3 U.S.C. 102 note), the travel or transportation shall take place at any time after the most recent general elections held to determine the electors of the President.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(a) Under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title and when the head of the agen<!-- PDFPage:544 -->cy concerned or his designee authorizes or approves, the agency shall pay from Government funds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the travel expenses of an employee transferred in the interest of the Government from one official station or agency to another for permanent duty, and the transportation expenses of his immediate family, or a commutation thereof under section 5704 of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the expenses of transporting, packing, crating, temporarily storing, draying, and unpacking his household goods and personal effects not in excess of 18,000 pounds net weight; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) upon the separation (or death in service) of a career appointee, as defined in section 3132(a)(4) of this title, the travel expenses of that individual (if applicable), the transportation expenses of the immediate family of such individual, and the expenses of moving (including transporting, packing, crating, temporarily storing, draying, and unpacking) the household goods of such individual and personal effects not in excess of eighteen thousand pounds net weight, to the place where the individual will reside (or, in the case of a career appointee who dies in service or who dies after separating but before the travel, transportation, and moving is completed, to the place where the family will reside) within the United States, if such individual&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) during or after the five years preceding eligibility to receive an annuity under subchapter III of chapter 83, or of chapter 84 of this title, has been transferred in the interest of the Government from one official station to another for permanent duty as a career appointee in the Senior Executive Service or as a director under section 4103(a)(8) of title 38 (as in effect on November 17, 1988); and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) is eligible to receive an annuity upon such separation (or, in the case of death in service, met the requirements for being considered eligible to receive an annuity, as of date of death) under the provisions of subchapter III of chapter 83 or chapter 84 of this title.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) Under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title, an employee who transports a house trailer or mobile dwelling inside the continental United States, inside Alaska, or between the continental United States and Alaska, for use as a residence, and who otherwise would be entitled to transportation of household goods and personal effects under subsection (a) of this section, is entitled, instead of that transportation, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a reasonable allowance for transportation of the house trailer or mobile dwelling, if the trailer or dwelling is transported by the employee; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) commercial transportation of the house trailer or mobile dwelling, at Government expense, or reimbursement to the employee therefor, including the payment of necessary tolls, charges, and permit fees, if the trailer or dwelling is not transported by the employee.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) Under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title, an employee who transfers between points inside the continental United States, instead of being paid for the actual expenses of transporting, packing, crating, temporarily storing, draying, and unpacking of household goods and personal effects, shall be reimbursed on a commuted basis at the rates per 100 pounds that are fixed by zones in the regulations. The reimbursement may not exceed the amount which would be allowable for the authorized weight allowance. However, under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title, payment of actual expenses may be made when the head of the agency determines that payment of actual expenses is more economical to the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(d) When an employee transfers to a post of duty outside the continental United States, his expenses of travel and transportation to and from the post shall be allowed to the same extent and with the same limitations prescribed for a new appointee under section 5722 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(e) When an employee transfers from one agency to another, the agency to which he transfers pays the expenses authorized by this section. However, under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title, in a transfer from one agency to another because of a reduction in force or transfer of function, expenses authorized by this section and sections 5726(b) and 5727 of this title (other than expenses authorized in connection with a transfer to a foreign country) and by section 5724a(a) through (f) of this title may be paid in whole or in part by the agency from which the employee transfers or by the agency to which he transfers, as may be agreed on by the heads of the agencies concerned.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(f) An advance of funds may be made to an employee under regulations prescribed under section 5738 of this title with the same safeguards required under section 5705 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(g) The allowances authorized by this section do not apply to an employee transferred under the Foreign Service Act of 1980.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(h) When a transfer is made primarily for the convenience or benefit of an employee, including an employee in the Foreign Service of the United States, or at his request, his expenses of travel and transportation and the expenses of transporting, packing, crating, temporarily storing, draying, and unpacking of household goods and personal effects may not be allowed or paid from Government funds.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(i) An agency may pay travel and transportation expenses (including storage of household goods and personal effects) and other relocation allowances under this section and sections 5724a, 5724b, and 5726(c) of this title when an employee is transferred within the continental United States only after the employee agrees in writing to remain in the Government service for 12 months after his transfer, unless separated for reasons beyond his control that are acceptable to the agency concerned. If the employee violates the agreement, the money spent by the <!-- PDFPage:545 -->Government for the expenses and allowances is recoverable from the employee as a debt due the Government.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(j) The regulations prescribed under this section shall provide that the reassignment or transfer of any employee, for permanent duty, from one official station or agency to another which is outside the employee's commuting area shall take effect only after the employee has been given advance notice for a reasonable period. Emergency circumstances shall be taken into account in determining whether the period of advance notice is reasonable.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(b) The Office of Personnel Management may authorize the head of an agency to pay a retention bonus to an employee if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the unusually high or unique qualifications of the employee or a special need of the agency for the employee's services makes it essential to retain the employee; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the agency determines that, in the absence of a retention bonus, the employee would be likely to leave&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the Federal service; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) for a different position in the Federal service under conditions described in regulations of the Office.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(c) The Office may authorize the head of an agency to pay retention bonuses to a group of employees in 1 or more categories of positions in 1 or more geographic areas, subject to the requirements of subsection (b)(1) and regulations prescribed by the Office, if there is a high risk that a significant portion of employees in the group would be likely to leave in the absence of retention bonuses.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) A retention bonus may be paid to an employee in installments after completion of specified periods of service or in a single lump sum at the end of the full period of service required by the agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) An installment payment is derived by multiplying the amount of basic pay earned in the installment period by a percentage not to exceed the bonus percentage rate established for the employee.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) If the installment payment percentage established for the employee is less than the bonus percentage rate established for the employee, the accrued but unpaid portion of the bonus is payable as part of the final installment payment to the employee after completion of the full service period under the terms of the service agreement.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) For purposes of this paragraph, the bonus percentage rate established for an employee means the bonus percentage rate established for such employee in accordance with paragraph (1) or subsection (f), as the case may be.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(f) Upon the request of the head of an agency, the Office may waive the limit established under subsection (e)(1) and permit the agency head to pay an otherwise eligible employee or category of employees retention bonuses of up to 50 percent of basic pay, based on a critical agency need.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the agency determines that replacing the employee with another employee possessing the required qualifications and experience would be difficult; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the agency determines it is in the best interest of the Government to encourage the employee to complete a specified additional period of employment with the agency in the territory or possession, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico or Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, except that the total amount of service performed in a particular territory, commonwealth, or possession under 1 or more agreements established under this section may not exceed 5 years.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(c)(1) Payment of an extended assignment incentive shall be contingent upon the employee entering into a written agreement with the agency specifying the period of service and other terms and conditions under which the extended assignment incentive is payable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The agreement shall set forth the method of payment, including any use of an initial lump-sum payment, installment payments, or a final lump-sum payment upon completion of the entire period of service.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">An employee serving in a foreign area may be granted a danger pay allowance on the basis of civil insurrection, civil war, terrorism, or wartime conditions which threaten physical harm or imminent danger to the health or well-being of the employee. A danger pay allowance may not exceed 35 percent of the basic pay of the employee, except that if an employee is granted an additional differential under section 5925(b) of this title with respect to an assignment, the sum of that additional differential and any danger pay allowance granted to the employee with respect to that assignment may not exceed 35 percent of the basic pay of the employee. The presence of nonessential personnel or dependents shall not preclude payment of an allowance under this section. In each instance where an allowance under this section is initiated or terminated, the Secretary of State shall inform the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate of the action taken and the circumstances justifying it.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The allowance may not exceed 25 percent of the rate of basic pay.

<p class="statutory-body">(B) Each adjusted cost-of-living allowance rate under paragraph (1) shall be computed by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) subtracting 65 percent of the applicable locality-based comparability pay percentage from the cost-of-living allowance percentage rate in effect on December 31, 2009; and</p>
