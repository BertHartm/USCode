<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) United States development cooperation policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that fundamental political, economic, and technological changes have resulted in the interdependence of nations. The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect individual civil and economic rights and freedoms and which work together to use wisely the world's limited resources in an open and equitable international economic system. Furthermore, the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness, and ignorance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Therefore, the Congress declares that a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">United States development cooperation policy should emphasize five principal goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alleviation of the worst physical manifestations of poverty among the world's poor majority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the promotion of conditions enabling developing countries to achieve self-sustaining economic growth with equitable distribution of benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the encouragement of development processes in which individual civil and economic rights are respected and enhanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the integration of the developing countries into an open and equitable international economic system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the promotion of good governance through combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that pursuit of these goals requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United States foreign policy and that United States development resources be effectively and efficiently utilized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coordination of development-related activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the policy guidance of the Secretary of State, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should have the responsibility for coordinating all United States development-related activities.</p>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">&ldquo;TITLE I&mdash;BILATERAL ACTION ON ADDRESSING URGENT NEEDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 101. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The National Security Strategy of the United States, dated September 17, 2002, concludes that &lsquo;[i]n Africa, promise and opportunity sit side-by-side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United States preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror. American interests and American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) On February 16, 2005, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency testified, &lsquo;In Africa, chronic instability will continue to hamper counterterrorism efforts and pose heavy humanitarian and peacekeeping burdens.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the United States Agency for International Development, &lsquo;Given its size, population, and resources, the Congo is an important player in Africa and of long-term interest to the United States.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Democratic Republic of the Congo is 2,345,410 square miles (approximately 1/4 the size of the United States), lies at the heart of Africa, and touches every major region of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, a secure, peaceful, and prosperous Democratic Republic of the Congo would have a profound impact on progress throughout Africa.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The most recent war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which erupted in 1998, spawned some of the world's worst human rights atrocities and drew in six neighboring countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Despite the conclusion of a peace agreement and subsequent withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, both the real and perceived presence of armed groups hostile to the Governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi continue to serve as a major source of regional instability and an apparent pretext for continued interference in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by its neighbors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) A mortality study completed in December 2004 by the International Rescue Committee found that <!-- PDFPage:459 -->31,000 people were dying monthly and 3,800,000 people had died in the previous six years because of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and resulting disintegration of the social service infrastructure, making this one of the deadliest conflicts since World War II.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) In 2004, Amnesty International estimated that at least 40,000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1998, and nearly two-thirds of ongoing abuses against women and girls are perpetrated by members of the security forces, particularly the Forces Armes de la Republique Democratique du Congo (FARDC) and the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) According to the Department of State, &lsquo;returning one of Africa's largest countries [the Democratic Republic of the Congo] to full peace and stability will require significant United States investments in support of national elections, the reintegration of former combatants, the return and reintegration of refugees and [internally displaced persons], establishment of central government control over vast territories, and promotion of national reconciliation and good governance&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to help promote, reinvigorate, and support the political process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to press all parties in the Transitional National Government and the succeeding government to implement fully and to institutionalize mechanisms, including national and international election observers, fair and transparent voter registration procedures, and a significant civic awareness and public education campaign created for the July 30, 2006, elections and future elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to ensure that elections are carried out in a fair and democratic manner;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize and act upon its responsibilities to immediately bring discipline to its security forces, hold those individuals responsible for atrocities and other human rights violations, particularly the rape of women and girls as an act of war, accountable and bring such individuals to justice;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to help ensure that, once a stable national government is established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is committed to multiparty democracy, open and transparent governance, respect for human rights and religious freedom, ending the violence throughout the country, promoting peace and stability with its neighbors, rehabilitating the national judicial system and enhancing the rule of law, combating corruption, instituting economic reforms to promote development, and creating an environment to promote private investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to assist the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as it seeks to meet the basic needs of its citizens, including security, safety, and access to health care, education, food, shelter, and clean drinking water;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to support security sector reform by assisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to establish a viable and professional national army and police force that respects human rights and the rule of law, is under effective civilian control, and possesses a viable presence throughout the entire country, provided the Democratic Republic of the Congo meets all requirements for United States military assistance under existing law;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to help expedite planning and implementation of programs associated with the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, reintegration, and rehabilitation process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to support efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), and other entities, as appropriate, to disarm, demobilize, and repatriate the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and other illegally armed groups;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to make all efforts to ensure that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) is committed to responsible and transparent management of natural resources across the country; and</p>

<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) to hold accountable individuals who illegally exploit the country's natural resources; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative by enacting laws requiring disclosure and independent auditing of company payments and government receipts for natural resource extraction;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) to promote a viable civil society and to enhance nongovernmental organizations and institutions, including religious organizations, the media, political parties, trade unions, and trade and business associations, that can act as a stabilizing force and effective check on the government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) to help rebuild and enhance infrastructure, communications, and other mechanisms that will increase the ability of the central government to manage internal affairs, encourage economic development, and facilitate relief efforts of humanitarian organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) to help halt the high prevalence of sexual abuse and violence perpetrated against women and children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and mitigate the detrimental effects from acts of this type of violence by undertaking a number of health, education, and psycho-social support programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) to work aggressively on a bilateral basis to urge governments of countries contributing troops to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to enact and enforce laws on trafficking in persons and sexual abuse that meet international standards, promote codes of conduct for troops serving as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions, and immediately investigate and punish citizens who are responsible for abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) to assist the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as undertakes steps to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) protect internally displaced persons and refugees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and border regions from all forms of violence, including gender-based violence and other human rights abuses;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) address other basic needs of vulnerable populations with the goal of allowing these conflict-affected individuals to ultimately return to their homes; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) assess the magnitude of the problem of orphans from conflict and HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and work to establish a program of national support;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) to engage with governments working to promote peace and security throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo and hold accountable individuals, entities, and countries working to destabilize the country; and</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;175, Dec. 12, 2003, 117 Stat. 2482, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On June 24, 2002, President Bush stated &lsquo;Syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001) mandates that all states &lsquo;refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts&rsquo;, take &lsquo;the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts&rsquo;, and &lsquo;deny safe haven to those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by United States law from receiving United States assistance because it has repeatedly provided <!-- PDFPage:462 -->support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State for purposes of section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)) and other relevant provisions of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Although the Department of State lists Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides &lsquo;safe haven and support to several terrorist groups&rsquo;, fewer United States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with respect to any other country that is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&mdash;General Command, maintain offices, training camps, and other facilities on Syrian territory, and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces and receive supplies from Iran through Syria.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) calls for &lsquo;strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese Army throughout Lebanon&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Approximately 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon exerting undue influence upon its government and undermining its political independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have passed seven bills and resolutions which call for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) On March 3, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that it is the objective of the United States to &lsquo;let Lebanon be ruled by the Lebanese people without the presence of [the Syrian] occupation army&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978), as certified by the United Nations Secretary General.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Even in the face of this United Nations certification that acknowledged Israel's full compliance with Security Council Resolution 425, Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah continues to attack Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the pretense that Shebaa Farms is territory from which Israel was required to withdraw by Security Counsel Resolution 425, and Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah and other militant organizations continue to attack civilian targets in Israel.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Syria will not allow Lebanon&mdash;a sovereign country&mdash;to fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which continues to attack Israeli positions, allows Iranian Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate freely in the area, and maintains thousands of rockets along Israel's northern border, destabilizing the entire region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) On February 12, 2003, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet stated the following with respect to the Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah: &lsquo;[A]s an organization with capability and worldwide presence [it] is [al Qaeda's] equal if not a far more capable organization *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [T]hey're a notch above in many respects, in terms of in their relationship with the Iranians and the training they receive, [which] puts them in a state-sponsored category with a potential for lethality that's quite great.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, President Bush declared that the United States will &lsquo;work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) The Government of Syria continues to develop and deploy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) According to the December 2001 unclassified Central Intelligence Agency report entitled &lsquo;Foreign Missile Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat through 2015&rsquo;, &lsquo;Syria maintains a ballistic missile and rocket force of hundreds of FROG rockets, Scuds, and SS&ndash;21 SRBMs [and] Syria has developed [chemical weapons] warheads for its Scuds&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) The Government of Syria is pursuing the development and production of biological and chemical weapons and has a nuclear research and development program that is cause for concern.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) According to the Central Intelligence Agency's &lsquo;Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions&rsquo;, released January 7, 2003: &lsquo;[Syria] already holds a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin but apparently is trying to develop more toxic and persistent nerve agents. Syria remains dependent on foreign sources for key elements of its [chemical weapons] program, including precursor chemicals and key production equipment. It is highly probable that Syria also is developing an offensive [biological weapons] capability.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) On May 6, 2002, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, stated: &lsquo;The United States also knows that Syria has long had a chemical warfare program. It has a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin and is engaged in research and development of the more toxic and persistent nerve agent VX. Syria, which has signed but not ratified the [Biological Weapons Convention], is pursuing the development of biological weapons and is able to produce at least small amounts of biological warfare agents.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) According to the Central Intelligence Agency's &lsquo;Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions&rsquo;, released January 7, 2003: &lsquo;Russia and Syria have approved a draft cooperative program on cooperation on civil nuclear power. In principal, broader access to Russian expertise provides opportunities for Syria to expand its indigenous capabilities, should it decide to pursue nuclear weapons.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(23) Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (21 UST 483), which entered force on March 5, 1970, and to which Syria is a party, Syria has undertaken not to acquire or produce nuclear weapons and has accepted full scope safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency to detect diversions of nuclear materials from peaceful activities to the production of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(24) Syria is not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention or the Biological Weapons Convention, which entered into force on April 29, 1997, and on March 26, 1975, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(25) Syrian President Bashar Assad promised Secretary of State Powell in February 2001 to end violations of Security Council Resolution 661, which restricted the sale of oil and other commodities by Saddam Hussein's regime, except to the extent authorized by other relevant resolutions, but this pledge was never fulfilled.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(26) Syria's illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil during Saddam Hussein's regime earned Syria $50,000,000 or more per month as Syria continued to sell its own Syrian oil at market prices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(27) Syria's illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil earned Saddam Hussein's regime $2,000,000 per day.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(28) On March 28, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld warned: &lsquo;[W]e have information that shipments of military supplies have been crossing the <!-- PDFPage:463 -->border from Syria into Iraq, including night-vision goggles *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* These deliveries pose a direct threat to the lives of coalition forces. We consider such trafficking as hostile acts, and will hold the Syrian government accountable for such shipments.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(29) According to Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, members of the United Nations are elected as nonpermanent members of the United Nations Security Council with &lsquo;due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to other purposes of the Organization&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(30) Despite Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, Syria was elected on October 8, 2001, to a 2-year term as a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council beginning January 1, 2002, and served as President of the Security Council during June 2002 and August 2003.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(31) On March 31, 2003, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Sharra, made the Syrian regime's intentions clear when he explicitly stated that &lsquo;Syria's interest is to see the invaders defeated in Iraq&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(32) On April 13, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld charged that &lsquo;busloads&rsquo; of Syrian fighters entered Iraq with &lsquo;hundreds of thousands of dollars&rsquo; and leaflets offering rewards for dead American soldiers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(33) On September 16, 2003, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, appeared before the Subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia of the Committee on International Relations [now Committee on Foreign Affairs] of the House of Representatives, and underscored Syria's &lsquo;hostile actions&rsquo; toward coalition forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Under Secretary Bolton added that: &lsquo;Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack and kill our service members during the war, and is still doing so *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [Syria's] behavior during Operation Iraqi Freedom underscores the importance of taking seriously reports and information on Syria's WMD capabilities.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(34) During his appearance before the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives on September 25, 2003, Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, III, Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, stated that out of the 278 third-country nationals who were captured by coalition forces in Iraq, the &lsquo;single largest group are Syrians&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Government of Syria should immediately and unconditionally halt support for terrorism, permanently and openly declare its total renunciation of all forms of terrorism, and close all terrorist offices and facilities in Syria, including the offices of Hamas, Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&mdash;General Command;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Government of Syria should&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) immediately and unconditionally stop facilitating transit from Syria to Iraq of individuals, military equipment, and all lethal items, except as authorized by the Coalition Provisional Authority or a representative, internationally recognized Iraqi government;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) cease its support for &lsquo;volunteers&rsquo; and terrorists who are traveling from and through Syria into Iraq to launch attacks; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) undertake concrete, verifiable steps to deter such behavior and control the use of territory under Syrian control;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Government of Syria should immediately declare its commitment to completely withdraw its armed forces, including military, paramilitary, and security forces, from Lebanon, and set a firm timetable for such withdrawal;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Government of Lebanon should deploy the Lebanese armed forces to all areas of Lebanon, including South Lebanon, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982), in order to assert the sovereignty of the Lebanese state over all of its territory, and should evict all terrorist and foreign forces from southern Lebanon, including Hizballah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Government of Syria should halt the development and deployment of medium- and long-range surface-to-surface missiles and cease the development and production of biological and chemical weapons;</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On September 22, 1980, Iraq invaded Iran, starting an 8 year war in which Iraq employed chemical weapons against Iranian troops and ballistic missiles against Iranian cities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) In February 1988, Iraq forcibly relocated Kurdish civilians from their home villages in the Anfal campaign, killing an estimated 50,000 to 180,000 Kurds.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) On March 16, 1988, Iraq used chemical weapons against Iraqi Kurdish civilian opponents in the town of Halabja, killing an estimated 5,000 Kurds and causing numerous birth defects that affect the town today.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) On August 2, 1990, Iraq invaded and began a 7 month occupation of Kuwait, killing and committing numerous abuses against Kuwaiti civilians, and setting Kuwait's oil wells ablaze upon retreat.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on February 28, 1991, and Iraq subsequently accepted the ceasefire conditions specified in United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 (April 3, 1991) requiring Iraq, among other things, to disclose fully and permit the dismantlement of its weapons of mass destruction programs and submit to long-term monitoring and verification of such dismantlement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In April 1993, Iraq orchestrated a failed plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his April 14&ndash;16, 1993, visit to Kuwait.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In October 1994, Iraq moved 80,000 troops to areas near the border with Kuwait, posing an immi<!-- PDFPage:468 -->nent threat of a renewed invasion of or attack against Kuwait.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) On August 31, 1996, Iraq suppressed many of its opponents by helping one Kurdish faction capture Irbil, the seat of the Kurdish regional government.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Since March 1996, Iraq has systematically sought to deny weapons inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) access to key facilities and documents, has on several occasions endangered the safe operation of UNSCOM helicopters transporting UNSCOM personnel in Iraq, and has persisted in a pattern of deception and concealment regarding the history of its weapons of mass destruction programs.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) On August 5, 1998, Iraq ceased all cooperation with UNSCOM, and subsequently threatened to end long-term monitoring activities by the International Atomic Energy Agency and UNSCOM.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) On August 14, 1998, President Clinton signed Public Law 105&ndash;235 [112 Stat. 1538], which declared that &lsquo;the Government of Iraq is in material and unacceptable breach of its international obligations&rsquo; and urged the President &lsquo;to take appropriate action, in accordance with the Constitution and relevant laws of the United States, to bring Iraq into compliance with its international obligations.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) On May 1, 1998, President Clinton signed Public Law 105&ndash;174 [see Tables for classification], which made $5,000,000 available for assistance to the Iraqi democratic opposition for such activities as organization, training, communication and dissemination of information, developing and implementing agreements among opposition groups, compiling information to support the indictment of Iraqi officials for war crimes, and for related purposes.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">African Conflict Resolution</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;381, Oct. 19, 1994, 108 Stat. 3513, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;African Conflict Resolution Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by <!-- PDFPage:470 -->more than 20 major civil wars since 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa's future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa's children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Africans have a long tradition of informal mediation. This tradition should be built upon to create effective institutions through which Africans can resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The effectiveness of U.S. support for conflict resolution programs requires coordination and collaboration with multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) African institutions are playing an active role in conflict resolution and mediation utilizing the experience of elder statesmen.
