<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Statement of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is in the national interest of the United States to assist in mitigating the burden that will be placed on sub-Saharan African social, economic, and political institutions as these institutions struggle with the consequences of a dramatically increasing AIDS orphan population, many of whom are themselves infected by HIV and living with AIDS. Effectively addressing that burden and its consequences in sub-Saharan Africa will require a coordinated multidonor strategy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Development of strategy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall coordinate the development of a multidonor strategy to provide for the support and education of AIDS orphans and the families, communities, and institutions most affected by the HIV/AIDS epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Definition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In this section, the term &ldquo;HIV/AIDS&rdquo; means, with respect to an individual, an individual who is infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the pathogen that causes the acquired immune deficiency virus (AIDS), or living with AIDS.</p>
