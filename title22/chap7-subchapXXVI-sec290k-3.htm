<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) within 12 months after the United States becomes a member of the Agency and each year thereafter for the 3 succeeding years, conduct an independent evaluation of the United States investments which have been guaranteed by the Agency to determine&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the anticipated net impact of such investments on employment in and exports from the United States, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the extent to which such investments were made in countries which had not taken or are not taking steps to afford internationally-recognized workers&rsquo; rights to workers in those countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
