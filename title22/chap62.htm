<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the macroeconomic policies, including the exchange rate policies, of the leading industrialized nations require improved coordination and are not consistent with long-term economic growth and financial stability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) currency values have a major role in determining the patterns of production and trade in the world economy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the rise in the value of the dollar in the early 1980's contributed substantially to our current trade deficit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) exchange rates among major trading nations have become increasingly volatile and a pattern of exchange rates has at times developed which contribute to substantial and persistent imbalances in the flow of goods and services between nations, imposing serious strains on the world trading system and frustrating both business and government planning;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) capital flows between nations have become very large compared to trade flows, respond at times quickly and dramatically to policy and economic changes, and, for these reasons, contribute significantly to uncertainty in financial markets, the volatility of exchange rates, and the development of exchange rates which produce imbalances in the flow of goods and services between nations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) policy initiatives by some major trading nations that manipulate the value of their currencies in relation to the United States dollar to gain competitive advantage continue to create serious competitive problems for United States industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) a more stable exchange rate for the dollar at a level consistent with a more appropriate and sustainable balance in the United States current account should be a major focus of national economic policy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) procedures for improving the coordination of macroeconomic policy need to be strengthened considerably; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) under appropriate circumstances, intervention by the United States in foreign exchange markets as part of a coordinated international strategic intervention effort could produce more orderly adjustment of foreign exchange markets and, in combination with necessary macroeconomic policy changes, assist adjustment toward a more appropriate and sustainable balance in current accounts.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the goal of the United States in international economic negotiations should be to achieve macroeconomic policies and exchange rates consistent with more appropriate and sustainable balances in trade and capital flows and to foster price stability in conjunction with economic growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the United States, in close coordination with the other major industrialized countries should, where appropriate, participate in international currency markets with the objective of producing more orderly adjustment of foreign exchange markets and, in combination with necessary macroeconomic policy changes, assisting adjustment toward a more appropriate and sustainable balance in current accounts; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of the Treasury shall analyze on an annual basis the exchange rate policies of foreign countries, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, and consider whether countries manipulate the rate of exchange between their currency and the United <!-- PDFPage:1359 -->States dollar for purposes of preventing effective balance of payments adjustments or gaining unfair competitive advantage in international trade. If the Secretary considers that such manipulation is occurring with respect to countries that (1) have material global current account surpluses; and (2) have significant bilateral trade surpluses with the United States, the Secretary of the Treasury shall take action to initiate negotiations with such foreign countries on an expedited basis, in the International Monetary Fund or bilaterally, for the purpose of ensuring that such countries regularly and promptly adjust the rate of exchange between their currencies and the United States dollar to permit effective balance of payments adjustments and to eliminate the unfair advantage. The Secretary shall not be required to initiate negotiations in cases where such negotiations would have a serious detrimental impact on vital national economic and security interests; in such cases, the Secretary shall inform the chairman and the ranking minority member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the Senate and of the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives of his determination.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) orderly reduction of international trade imbalances requires very substantial growth in all parts of the world economy, particularly in the developing countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) growth in developing countries with substantial external debts has been significantly constrained over the last several years by a combination of high debt service obligations and insufficient new flows of financial resources to these countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) substantial interest payment outflows from debtor countries, combined with inadequate net new capital inflows, have produced a significant net transfer of financial resources from debtor to creditor countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) negative resource transfers at present levels severely depress both investment and growth in the debtor countries, and force debtor countries to reduce imports and expand exports in order to meet their debt service obligations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) current adjustment policies in debtor countries, which depress domestic demand and increase production for export, help to depress world commodity prices and limit the growth of export markets for United States industries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the United States has borne a disproportionate share of the burden of absorbing increased exports from debtor countries, while other industrialized countries have increased their imports from developing countries only slightly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) current approaches to the debt problem should not rely solely on new lending as a solution to the debt problem, and should focus on other financing alternatives including a reduction in current debt service obligations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) new international mechanisms to improve the management of the debt problem and to expand the range of financing options available to developing countries should be explored; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) industrial countries with strong current account surpluses have a disproportionate share of the world's capital resources, and bear an additional responsibility for contributing to a viable long-term solution to the debt problem.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Directive</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Study</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Secretary of the Treasury shall study the feasibility and advisability of establishing the International Debt Management Authority described in this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Explanation of determinations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the Secretary of the Treasury determines that initiation of international discussions with regard to such authority would (A) result in material increase in the discount at which sovereign debt is sold, (B) materially increase the probability of default on such debt, or (C) materially enhance the likelihood of debt service failure or disruption, the Secretary shall include in his interim reports to the Congress an explanation in detail of the reasons for such determination.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Initiation of discussions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Unless such a determination is made, the Secretary of the Treasury shall initiate discussions with such industrialized and developing countries as the Secretary may determine to be appropriate with the intent to negotiate the establishment of the International Debt Management Authority, which would undertake to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) purchase sovereign debt of less developed countries from private creditors at an appropriate discount;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) enter into negotiations with the debtor countries for the purpose of restructuring the debt in order to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) ease the current debt service burden on the debtor countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) provide additional opportunities for economic growth in both debtor and industrialized countries; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) assist the creditor banks in the voluntary disposition of their Third World loan portfolio.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Objectives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In any discussions initiated under subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary should include the following specific proposals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) That any loan restructuring assistance provided by such an authority to any debtor nation should involve substantial commitments by the debtor to (A) economic policies designed to improve resource utilization and minimize capital flight, and (B) preparation of an economic management plan calculated to provide sustained economic growth and to allow the debtor to meet its restructured debt obligations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) That support for such an authority should come from industrialized countries, and that greater support should be expected from countries with strong current account surpluses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) That such an authority should have a clearly defined close working relationship with the International Monetary Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the various regional development banks.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) That such an authority should be designed to operate as a self-supporting entity, requiring no routine appropriation of resources from any member government, and to function subject to the prohibitions contained in the first sentence of section 5332(a) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) That such an authority should have a defined termination date and a clear proposal for the restoration of creditworthiness to debtor countries within this timeframe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Interim reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">At the end of the 6-month period beginning on August 23, 1988, and at the end of the 12-month period beginning on August 23, 1988, the Secretary of the Treasury shall submit a report on the progress being made on the study or in discussions described in subsection (a) of this section to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, and shall consult with such committees after submitting each such report.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Final report</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">On the conclusion of the study or of discussions described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall transmit a report containing a detailed description thereof to the Committee on Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate, together with such recommendations for legislation which the Secretary may determine to be necessary or appropriate for the establishment of the International Debt Management Authority.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) United States companies can successfully compete in foreign markets if they are given fair access to such markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) a trade surplus in services could offset the deficit in manufactured goods and help lower the overall trade deficit significantly;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in contrast to the barriers faced by United States firms in Japan, Japanese firms generally have enjoyed access to United States financial markets on the same terms as United States firms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) United States firms seeking to compete in Japan face or have faced a variety of discriminatory barriers effectively precluding such firms from fairly competing for Japanese business, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) limitations on membership on the Tokyo Stock Exchange;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) high fixed commission rates (ranging as high as 80 percent) which must be paid to members of the exchange by nonmembers for executing trades;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) unequal opportunities to participate in and act as lead manager for equity and bond underwritings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) restrictions on access to automated teller machines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) arbitrarily applied employment requirements for opening branch offices;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) long delays in processing applications and granting approvals for licenses to operate; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) restrictions on foreign institutions&rsquo; participation in Ministry of Finance policy advisory councils.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Designation of certain persons as primary dealers prohibited</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) General rule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Neither the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System nor the Federal Reserve Bank of New York may designate, or permit the continuation of any prior designation of, any person of a foreign country as a primary <!-- PDFPage:1363 -->dealer in government debt instruments if such foreign country does not accord to United States companies the same competitive opportunities in the underwriting and distribution of government debt instruments issued by such country as such country accords to domestic companies of such country.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain prior acquisitions excepted</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Paragraph (1) shall not apply to the continuation of the prior designation of a company as a primary dealer in government debt instruments if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) such designation occurred before July 31, 1987; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) before July 31, 1987&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) control of such company was acquired from a person (other than a person of a foreign country) by a person of a foreign country; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) in conjunction with a person of a foreign country, such company informed the Federal Reserve Bank of New York of the intention of such person to acquire control of such company.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Exception for countries having or negotiating bilateral agreements with United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subsection (b) of this section shall not apply to any person of a foreign country if&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that country, as of January 1, 1987, was negotiating a bilateral agreement with the United States under the authority of section 2112(b)(4)(A) of title 19; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that country has a bilateral free trade area agreement with the United States which entered into force before January 1, 1987.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) &ldquo;Person of a foreign country&rdquo; defined</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of this section, a person is a &ldquo;person of a foreign country&rdquo; if that person, or any other person which directly or indirectly owns or controls that person, is a resident of that country, is organized under the laws of that country, or has its principal place of business in that country.</p>
