Any such assignment shall be made at no cost to the exclusive representative or the individual. Except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, any such assignment may not be revoked for a period of one year from its execution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Termination of assignment for deduction of dues</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Negotiations with uncertified labor organizations</h4>

Negotiations under this subsection shall be concerned solely with the deduction of dues of the labor organization from the salary of the individuals who are members of the labor organization and who make a voluntary allotment for that purpose.
