Such property shall be sold or otherwise liquidated as expeditiously as possible after vesting under such rules and regulations as the President or his designee may prescribe. The net proceeds remaining upon completion of the administration and liquidation thereof, including the adjudication of any suits or claims with respect thereto under sections 1631f and 1631g of this title, shall be covered into the Treasury. Notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this subsection, any such property determined by the President or his designee to be owned directly by a natural person shall not be vested under this subsection but shall remain blocked subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe. If, at any time within one year from the date of the vesting of any property under this subsection, the President or his designee shall determine that it was directly owned at the date of vesting by a natural person, then the President or his designee shall divest such property and restore it to its blocked status prior to vesting, subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe, or if such property has been liquidated, shall divest the net proceeds thereof and carry them in blocked accounts with the Treasury, bearing no interest, in the name of the owner thereof at the date of vesting, subject to release when, as, and upon such terms as the President or his designee may prescribe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Net proceeds of property vested in Alien Property Custodian or Attorney General</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Determination of ownership by natural person of vested property</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The determination under this section that any vested property was not directly owned by a natural person at the date of vesting shall be within the sole discretion of the President or his designee and shall not be subject to review by any court.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Furnishing of information; production of books and records</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President or his designee may require any person to furnish, in the form of reports or otherwise, complete information, including information with regard to past transactions, relative to any property blocked under Executive Order 8389 of April 10, 1940, as amended, or as may be otherwise necessary to enforce the provisions of this section; and the President or his designee may require of any person the production of any books of account, records, contracts, letters, memoranda, or other papers relative to such property or as may be otherwise necessary to enforce the provisions of this section.</p>
