<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) promote agreements banning the transfer of missiles suitable for armament with chemical or biological warheads;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Multilateral controls on chemical agents, precursors, and equipment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is also the policy of the United States to strengthen efforts to control chemical agents, precursors, and equipment by taking all appropriate multilateral diplomatic measures&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to continue to seek a verifiable global ban on chemical weapons at the 40 nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to support the Australia Group's objective to support the norms and restraints against the spread and the use of chemical warfare, to advance the negotiation of a comprehensive ban on chemical warfare by taking appropriate measures, and to protect the Australia Group's domestic industries against inadvertent association with supply of feedstock chemical equipment that could be misused to produce chemical weapons;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) to implement paragraph (2) by proposing steps complementary to, and not mutually exclusive of, existing multilateral efforts seeking a verifiable ban on chemical weapons, such as the establishment of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) a harmonized list of export control rules and regulations to prevent relative commercial advantage and disadvantages accruing to Australia Group members,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) liaison officers to the Australia Group's coordinating entity from within the diplomatic missions,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) a close working relationship between the Australia Group and industry,</p>

<br class="Q04" />

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sanctions applied to existing contracts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The sanctions described in paragraphs (1), (2), and (3) of subsection (a) of this section shall apply to contracts, agreements, and licenses without regard to the date the contract or agreement was entered into or the license was issued (as the case may be), except that such sanctions shall not apply to any contract or agreement entered into or license issued before the date of the presidential determination under section 5604(a)(1) of this title if the President determines that the application of such sanction would be detrimental to the national security interests of the United States.</p>
