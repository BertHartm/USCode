<h4 class="note-head">Constitution of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization</h4>
<h4 class="note-head">the governments of the states parties to this constitution on behalf of their peoples declare</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">that since wars begin in the minds of men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of peace must be constructed;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">that ignorance of each other's ways and lives has been a common cause, throughout the history of mankind, of that suspicion and mistrust between the peoples of the world through which their differences have all too often broken into war;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">that the great and terrible war which has now ended was a war made possible by the denial of the democratic principles of the dignity, equality and mutual respect of men, and by the propagation, in their place, through ignorance and prejudice, of the doctrine of the inequality of men and races;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">that the wide diffusion of culture, and the education of humanity for justice and liberty and peace are indis<!-- PDFPage:199 -->pensable to the dignity of man and constitute a sacred duty which all the nations must fulfill in a spirit of mutual assistance and concern;</p>
<p class="note-body-block">that a peace based exclusively upon the political and economic arrangements of governments would not be a peace which could secure the unanimous, lasting and sincere support of the peoples of the world, and that the peace must therefore be founded, if it is not to fail, upon the intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind.</p>
<h4 class="note-head">for these reasons,</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">the States parties to this Constitution, believing in full and equal opportunities for education for all, in the unrestricted pursuit of objective truth, and in the free exchange of ideas and knowledge, are agreed and determined to develop and to increase the means of communication between their peoples and to employ these means for the purposes of mutual understanding and a truer and more perfect knowledge of each other's lives;</p>
<h4 class="note-head">in consequence whereof</h4>
<p class="note-body-block">they do hereby create the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation for the purpose of advancing, through the educational and scientific and cultural relations of the peoples of the world, the objectives of international peace and of the common welfare of mankind for which the United Nations Organisation was established and which its Charter proclaims.</p>

<p class="note-body">2. To realise this purpose the Organisation will:</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(<em>a</em>) collaborate in the work of advancing the mutual knowledge and understanding of peoples, through all means of mass communication and to that end recommend such international agreements as may be necessary to promote the free flow of ideas by word and image;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(<em>b</em>) give fresh impulse to popular education and to the spread of culture;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by collaborating with Members, at their request, in the development of educational activities; by instituting collaboration among the nations to advance the ideal of equality of educational opportunity without regard to race, sex or any distinctions, economic or social;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by suggesting educational methods best suited to prepare the children of the world for the responsibilities of freedom;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">(<em>c</em>) maintain, increase and diffuse knowledge;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by assuring the conservation and protection of the world's inheritance of books, works of art and monuments of history and science, and recommending to the nations concerned the necessary international conventions;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by encouraging cooperation among the nations in all branches of intellectual activity, including the international exchange of persons active in the fields of education, science and culture and the exchange of publications, objects of artistic and scientific interest and other materials of information;</p>
<p class="note-body-flush2_hang3">&nbsp;by initiating methods of international cooperation calculated to give the people of all countries access to the printed and published materials produced by any of them.</p>
<p class="note-body">3. With a view to preserving the independence, integrity and fruitful diversity of the cultures and educational systems of the States Members of this Organisation, the Organisation is prohibited from intervening in matters which are essentially within their domestic jurisdiction.</p>
