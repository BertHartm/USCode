<p class="statutory-body">(2) Such broadcasting service shall be referred to as &ldquo;Radio Free Asia&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Functions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Radio Free Asia shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) provide accurate and timely information, news, and commentary about events in the respective countries of Asia and elsewhere; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) be a forum for a variety of opinions and voices from within Asian nations whose people do not fully enjoy freedom of expression.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Any grant agreement or grants under this section shall be subject to the following limitations and restrictions:</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Any grant agreement under this section shall require that any contract entered into by Radio Free Asia shall specify that all obligations are assumed by Radio Free Asia and not by the United States Government, and shall further specify that funds to carry out the activities of Radio Free Asia may not be available after September 30, 2010.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any grant agreement shall require that any lease agreements entered into by Radio Free Asia shall be, to the maximum extent possible, assignable to the United States Government.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitations on administrative and managerial costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that administrative and managerial costs for operation of Radio Free Asia should be kept to a minimum and, to the maximum extent feasible, should not exceed the costs that would have been incurred if Radio Free Asia had been operated as a Federal entity rather than as a grantee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Assessment of effectiveness of Radio Free Asia</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 3 years after the date on which initial funding is provided for the purpose of operating Radio Free Asia, the Board shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) whether Radio Free Asia consistently meets the standards for quality and objectivity established by this chapter,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) whether Radio Free Asia is received by a sufficient audience to warrant its continuation,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the extent to which such broadcasting is already being received by the target audience from other credible sources; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1463 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the extent to which the interests of the United States are being served by maintaining broadcasting of Radio Free Asia.</p>

The Chairman of the Board shall consult with such committees on the impact of any such reduction in Voice of America broadcasting activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Not a Federal agency or instrumentality</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter may be construed to make Radio Free Asia a Federal agency or instrumentality.</p>
