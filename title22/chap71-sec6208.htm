<p class="statutory-body">(4) If the Board determines that a Radio Free Asia cannot be established or operated effectively within the funding limitations provided for in this section, the Board may submit, through the Director of the United States Information Agency, an alternative plan and such proposed changes in legislation as may be necessary to the appropriate congressional committees.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Not a Federal agency or instrumentality</h4>
