<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Sub-Saharan Africa faces a virtually unprecedented condition of human misery which threatens the lives of one hundred and fifty million people;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) only the combined effort of both the African nations themselves and international aid donors can overcome the obstacles to economic development which have given rise to conditions of famine, declining food production, infant mortality, desertification, and deteriorating infrastructure;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) international relief efforts have helped to address the immediate crisis of starvation in Africa and the United States has made important contributions to this effort both bilaterally and through contributions to the multilateral development institutions;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) there is a serious shortfall in the external capital resources necessary to support the policy reform efforts of the African governments and to achieve the long-term development necessary to avert a chronic state of crisis in Sub-Saharan Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa will have as its primary goal the implementation of policy reforms to help the African countries to help themselves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to succeed, these efforts must be reinforced by development resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the appalling conditions prevalent in the countries of Sub-Saharan Africa underscore the need for <!-- PDFPage:119 -->the United States to participate in a coordinated framework with the other aid donor countries; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the Special Facility for Sub-Saharan Africa provides such a framework and it is in the humanitarian, economic, and strategic interests of the United States to participate.&rdquo;</p>
