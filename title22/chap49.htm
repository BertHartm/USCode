<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy of support for peace treaty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the policy of the United States to support the peace treaty concluded between the Government of Egypt and the Government of Israel on March 26, 1979. This treaty is a significant step toward a full and comprehensive peace in the Middle East. The Congress urges the President to continue to exert every effort to bring about a comprehensive peace and to seek an end by all parties to the violence which could jeopardize this peace.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The peace treaty between Egypt and Israel having been ratified, the Congress finds that the national interests of the United States are served&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) by authorizing the President to construct air bases in Israel to replace the Israeli air bases on the Sinai peninsula that are to be evacuated;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) by authorizing additional funds to finance procurements by Egypt and Israel through the fiscal year 1982 of defense articles <!-- PDFPage:1047 -->and defense services for their respective security requirements; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) by authorizing additional funds for economic assistance for Egypt in order to promote the economic stability and development of that country and to support the peace process in the Middle East.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Other agreements, understandings, or commitments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The authorities contained in this subchapter to implement certain arrangements in support of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel do not signify approval by the Congress of any other agreement, understanding, or commitment made by the executive branch.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings; use of Arms Export Control Act procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the legitimate defense interests of Israel and Egypt require a one time extraordinary assistance package due to Israel's phased withdrawal from the Sinai and Egypt's shift from reliance on Soviet weaponry. The authorizations contained in this section do not, however, constitute Congressional approval of the sale of any particular weapons system to either country. These sales will be reviewed under the normal procedures set forth in section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2776(b)].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to amounts authorized to be appropriated for the fiscal year 1979 by section 31(a) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2771(a)], there is authorized to be appropriated to the President to carry out that Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.] $370,000,000 for the fiscal year 1979.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Principal amounts of guaranteed loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Funds made available pursuant to subsection (b) of this section may be used only for guaranties for Egypt and Israel pursuant to section 24(a) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2764(a)]. The principal amount of loans guaranteed with such funds may not exceed $3,700,000,000 of which $2,200,000,000 shall be available only for Israel and $1,500,000,000 shall be available only for Egypt. The principal amount of such guaranteed loans shall be in addition to the aggregate ceiling authorized for the fiscal year 1979 by section 31(b) of the Arms Export Control Act [22 U.S.C. 2771(b)].</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Repayment schedule</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Loans guaranteed with funds made available pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be on terms calling for repayment within a period of not less than thirty years, including an initial grace period of ten years on repayment of principal.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Modification of terms of guaranteed loans</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress finds that the Governments of Israel and Egypt each have an enormous external debt burden which may be made more difficult by virtue of the financing authorized by this section. The Congress further finds that, as a consequence of the impact of the debt burdens incurred by Israel and Egypt under such financing, it may become necessary in future years to modify the terms of the loans guaranteed with funds made available pursuant to this section.</p>
