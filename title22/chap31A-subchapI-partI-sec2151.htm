<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) United States development cooperation policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that fundamental political, economic, and technological changes have resulted in the interdependence of nations. The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect individual civil and economic rights and freedoms and which work together to use wisely the world's limited resources in an open and equitable international economic system. Furthermore, the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness, and ignorance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Therefore, the Congress declares that a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">United States development cooperation policy should emphasize four principal goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alleviation of the worst physical manifestations of poverty among the world's poor majority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the promotion of conditions enabling developing countries to achieve self-sustaining economic growth with equitable distribution of benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the encouragement of development processes in which individual civil and economic rights are respected and enhanced; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the integration of the developing countries into an open and equitable international economic system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that pursuit of these goals requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United States foreign policy and that United States development resources be effectively and efficiently utilized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coordination of development-related activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the policy guidance of the Secretary of State, the Director of the United States International Development Cooperation Agency should have the responsibility for coordinating <!-- PDFPage:423 -->all United States development-related activities.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;African Conflict Resolution Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by more than 20 major civil wars since 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa's future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa's children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.</p>
