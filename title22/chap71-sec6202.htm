<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) VOA will serve as a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news. VOA news will be accurate, objective, and comprehensive.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) VOA will represent America, not any single segment of American society, and will therefore present a balanced and comprehensive projection of significant American thought and institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) VOA will present the policies of the United States clearly and effectively, and will also present responsible discussions and opinion on these policies.</p>
