<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Presidential consultations with other countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that other countries should give favorable consideration to providing support for the implementation of the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. Therefore, the Congress requests that the President consult with other countries in order to (1) promote and develop an agreement for the establishment of a peace development fund whose purpose would be to underwrite the costs of implementing a Middle East peace, and (2) encourage investments in Israel and Egypt and other countries in the region should they join in Middle East peace agreements.</p>
