<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) United States development cooperation policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that fundamental political, economic, and technological changes have resulted in the interdependence of nations. The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect individual civil and economic rights and freedoms and which work together to use wisely the world's limited resources in an open and equitable international economic system. Furthermore, the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in developing countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness, and ignorance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Therefore, the Congress declares that a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">United States development cooperation policy should emphasize five principal goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alleviation of the worst physical manifestations of poverty among the world's poor majority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the promotion of conditions enabling developing countries to achieve self-sustaining economic growth with equitable distribution of benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the encouragement of development processes in which individual civil and economic rights are respected and enhanced;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the integration of the developing countries into an open and equitable international economic system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the promotion of good governance through combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that pursuit of these goals requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United States foreign policy and that United States development resources be effectively and efficiently utilized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coordination of development-related activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the policy guidance of the Secretary of State, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should have the responsibility for coordinating all United States development-related activities.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 111&ndash;172, May 24, 2010, 124 Stat. 1209, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Lord's Resistance Army Disarmament and Northern Uganda Recovery Act of 2009&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) For over 2 decades, the Government of Uganda engaged in an armed conflict with the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA) in northern Uganda that led to the internal displacement of more than 2,000,000 Ugandans from their homes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The members of the Lord's Resistance Army used brutal tactics in northern Uganda, including mutilating, abducting and forcing individuals into sexual servitude and forcing a large number of children and youth in Uganda, estimated by the Survey for War Affected Youth to be over 66,000, to fight as part of the rebel force.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Secretary of State has placed the Lord's Resistance Army on the Terrorist Exclusion list pursuant to section 212(a)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1182(a)(3)), and LRA leader Joseph Kony has been designated a &lsquo;specially designated global terrorist&rsquo; pursuant to Executive Order 13224 [listed in a table under section 1701 of Title 50, War and National Defense].</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) In late 2005, according to the United Nations Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the Lord's Resistance Army shifted their primary base of operations from southern Sudan to northeastern Democratic Republic of Congo, and the rebels have since withdrawn from northern Uganda.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Representatives of the Government of Uganda and the Lord's Resistance Army began peace negotiations in 2006, mediated by the Government of Southern Sudan in Juba, Sudan, and signed the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on August 20, 2006, which provided for hundreds of thousands of internally displaced people to return home in safety.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) After nearly 2 years of negotiations, representatives from the parties reached the Final Peace Agreement in April 2008, but Joseph Kony, the leader of the Lord's Resistance Army, refused to sign the Final Peace Agreement in May 2008 and his forces launched new attacks in northeastern Congo.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Relief and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the new activity of the Lord's Resistance Army in northeastern Congo and southern Sudan since September 2008 has led to the abduction of at least 1,500 civilians, including hundreds of children, and the displacement of more than 540,000 people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) In December 2008, the military forces of Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and southern Sudan launched a joint operation against the Lord's Resistance Army's bases in northeastern Congo, but the operation failed to apprehend Joseph Kony, and his forces retaliated with a series of new attacks and massacres in Congo and southern Sudan, killing an estimated 900 people in 2 months alone.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Despite the refusal of Joseph Kony to sign the Final Peace Agreement, the Government of Uganda has committed to continue reconstruction plans for northern Uganda, and to implement those mechanisms of the Final Peace Agreement not conditional on the compliance of the Lord's Resistance Army.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Since 2008, recovery efforts in northern Uganda have moved forward with the financial support of the United States and other donors, but have been hampered by a lack of strategic coordination, logistical delays, and limited leadership from the Government of Uganda.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States to work with regional governments toward a comprehensive and lasting resolution to the conflict in northern Uganda and other affected areas by&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) providing political, economic, military, and intelligence support for viable multilateral efforts to protect civilians from the Lord's Resistance Army, to apprehend or remove Joseph Kony and his top commanders from the battlefield in the continued absence of a negotiated solution, and to disarm and demobilize the remaining Lord's Resistance Army fighters;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) targeting assistance to respond to the humanitarian needs of populations in northeastern Congo, southern Sudan, and Central African Republic currently affected by the activity of the Lord's Resistance Army; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) further supporting and encouraging efforts of the Government of Uganda and civil society to promote comprehensive reconstruction, transitional justice, and reconciliation in northern Uganda as affirmed in the Northern Uganda Crisis Response Act of 2004 (Public Law 108&ndash;283) and subsequent resolutions, including Senate Resolution 366, 109th Congress, agreed to February 2, 2006, Senate Resolution 573, 109th Congress, agreed to September 19, 2006, Senate Concurrent Resolution 16, 110th Congress, agreed to in the Senate March 1, 2007, and House Concurrent Resolution 80, 110th Congress, agreed to in the House of Representatives June 18, 2007.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Authority</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the President should support efforts by the people of northern Uganda and the Government of Uganda&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to rebuild and improve the capacity of the justice system in northern Uganda, including the courts and penal systems, with particular sensitivity to the needs and rights of women and children;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to establish mechanisms for the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of former combatants and those abducted by the LRA, including vocational education and employment opportunities, with attention given to the roles and needs of men, women and children; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to promote programs to address psychosocial trauma, particularly post-traumatic stress disorder.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Future Year Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State and Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development should work with the appropriate committees of Congress to increase assistance in future fiscal years to support activities described in this section if the Government of Uganda demonstrates a commitment to transparent and accountable reconstruction in war-affected areas of northern Uganda, specifically by&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) finalizing the establishment of mechanisms within the Office of the Prime Minister to sufficiently manage and coordinate the programs under the framework of the Peace Recovery and Development Plan for Northern Uganda (PRDP);</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(d) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should withhold non-humanitarian bilateral assistance to the Republic of Uganda if the Secretary determines that the Government of Uganda is not committed to reconstruction and reconciliation in the war-affected areas of northern Uganda and is not taking proactive steps to ensure this process moves forward in a transparent and accountable manner.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 7. ASSISTANCE FOR RECONCILIATION AND TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE IN NORTHERN UGANDA.</h4>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>

<h4 class="analysis-subhead">&ldquo;TITLE I&mdash;BILATERAL ACTION ON ADDRESSING URGENT NEEDS IN THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO</h4>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 101. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The National Security Strategy of the United States, dated September 17, 2002, concludes that &lsquo;[i]n Africa, promise and opportunity sit side-by-side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United States preserving human dignity and our strategic priority combating global terror. American interests and American principles, therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) On February 16, 2005, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency testified, &lsquo;In Africa, chronic instability will continue to hamper counterterrorism efforts and pose heavy humanitarian and peacekeeping burdens.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the United States Agency for International Development, &lsquo;Given its size, population, and resources, the Congo is an important player in Africa and of long-term interest to the United States.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The Democratic Republic of the Congo is 2,345,410 square miles (approximately &frac14; the size of the United States), lies at the heart of Africa, and touches every major region of sub-Saharan Africa. Therefore, a secure, peaceful, and prosperous Democratic Republic of the Congo would have a profound impact on progress throughout Africa.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The most recent war in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which erupted in 1998, spawned some of the world's worst human rights atrocities and drew in six neighboring countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Despite the conclusion of a peace agreement and subsequent withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, <!-- PDFPage:468 -->both the real and perceived presence of armed groups hostile to the Governments of Uganda, Rwanda, and Burundi continue to serve as a major source of regional instability and an apparent pretext for continued interference in the Democratic Republic of the Congo by its neighbors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) A mortality study completed in December 2004 by the International Rescue Committee found that 31,000 people were dying monthly and 3,800,000 people had died in the previous six years because of the conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and resulting disintegration of the social service infrastructure, making this one of the deadliest conflicts since World War II.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) In 2004, Amnesty International estimated that at least 40,000 women and girls were systematically raped and tortured in the Democratic Republic of the Congo since 1998, and nearly two-thirds of ongoing abuses against women and girls are perpetrated by members of the security forces, particularly the Forces Armes de la Republique Democratique du Congo (FARDC) and the Police Nationale Congolaise (PNC).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) According to the Department of State, &lsquo;returning one of Africa's largest countries [the Democratic Republic of the Congo] to full peace and stability will require significant United States investments in support of national elections, the reintegration of former combatants, the return and reintegration of refugees and [internally displaced persons], establishment of central government control over vast territories, and promotion of national reconciliation and good governance&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 102. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to help promote, reinvigorate, and support the political process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in order to press all parties in the Transitional National Government and the succeeding government to implement fully and to institutionalize mechanisms, including national and international election observers, fair and transparent voter registration procedures, and a significant civic awareness and public education campaign created for the July 30, 2006, elections and future elections in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, to ensure that elections are carried out in a fair and democratic manner;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to urge the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to recognize and act upon its responsibilities to immediately bring discipline to its security forces, hold those individuals responsible for atrocities and other human rights violations, particularly the rape of women and girls as an act of war, accountable and bring such individuals to justice;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to help ensure that, once a stable national government is established in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, it is committed to multiparty democracy, open and transparent governance, respect for human rights and religious freedom, ending the violence throughout the country, promoting peace and stability with its neighbors, rehabilitating the national judicial system and enhancing the rule of law, combating corruption, instituting economic reforms to promote development, and creating an environment to promote private investment;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to assist the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as it seeks to meet the basic needs of its citizens, including security, safety, and access to health care, education, food, shelter, and clean drinking water;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to support security sector reform by assisting the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo to establish a viable and professional national army and police force that respects human rights and the rule of law, is under effective civilian control, and possesses a viable presence throughout the entire country, provided the Democratic Republic of the Congo meets all requirements for United States military assistance under existing law;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) to help expedite planning and implementation of programs associated with the disarmament, demobilization, repatriation, reintegration, and rehabilitation process in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) to support efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC), and other entities, as appropriate, to disarm, demobilize, and repatriate the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda and other illegally armed groups;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) to make all efforts to ensure that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) is committed to responsible and transparent management of natural resources across the country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) takes active measures&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(i) to promote economic development;</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(ii) to hold accountable individuals who illegally exploit the country's natural resources; and</p>
<p class="note-body-3em">&ldquo;(iii) to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative by enacting laws requiring disclosure and independent auditing of company payments and government receipts for natural resource extraction;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) to promote a viable civil society and to enhance nongovernmental organizations and institutions, including religious organizations, the media, political parties, trade unions, and trade and business associations, that can act as a stabilizing force and effective check on the government;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) to help rebuild and enhance infrastructure, communications, and other mechanisms that will increase the ability of the central government to manage internal affairs, encourage economic development, and facilitate relief efforts of humanitarian organizations;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) to help halt the high prevalence of sexual abuse and violence perpetrated against women and children in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and mitigate the detrimental effects from acts of this type of violence by undertaking a number of health, education, and psycho-social support programs;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) to work aggressively on a bilateral basis to urge governments of countries contributing troops to the United Nations Peacekeeping Mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (MONUC) to enact and enforce laws on trafficking in persons and sexual abuse that meet international standards, promote codes of conduct for troops serving as part of United Nations peacekeeping missions, and immediately investigate and punish citizens who are responsible for abuses in the Democratic Republic of the Congo;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) to assist the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo as undertakes steps to&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) protect internally displaced persons and refugees in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and border regions from all forms of violence, including gender-based violence and other human rights abuses;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) address other basic needs of vulnerable populations with the goal of allowing these conflict-affected individuals to ultimately return to their homes; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) assess the magnitude of the problem of orphans from conflict and HIV/AIDS in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and work to establish a program of national support;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) to engage with governments working to promote peace and security throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo and hold accountable individuals, entities, and countries working to destabilize the country; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) to promote appropriate use of the forests of the Democratic Republic of the Congo in a manner that benefits the rural population in that country that depends on the forests for their livelihoods and protects national and environmental interests.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 103. BILATERAL ASSISTANCE TO THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Funding for Fiscal Years</cap-smallcap> 2006 <cap-smallcap>and</cap-smallcap> 2007.&mdash;Of the amounts made available to carry out the Foreign As<!-- PDFPage:469 -->sistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 [now Food for Peace Act] [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] (68 Stat. 454, chapter 469), and the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.) for fiscal year 2006 and 2007, at least $52,000,000 for each such fiscal year should be allocated for bilateral assistance programs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Future Year Funding</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Department of State should submit budget requests in fiscal years 2008 and 2009 that contain increases in bilateral assistance for the Democratic Republic of the Congo that are appropriate if progress is being made, particularly cooperation by the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, toward accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Coordination With Other Donor Nations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States should work with other donor nations, on a bilateral and multilateral basis, to increase international contributions to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and accomplish the policy objectives described in section 102.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 104. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE GOVERNMENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Sense of Congress</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be committed to achieving the policy objectives described in section 102 if the efforts of the United States and other members of the international community are to be effective in bringing relief, security, and democracy to the country;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo should immediately exercise control over and discipline its armed forces, stop the mass rapes at the hands of its armed forces, and hold those responsible for these acts accountable before an appropriate tribunal;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in collaboration with international aid agencies, should establish expert teams to assess the needs of the victims of rape and provide health, counseling, and social support services that such victims need; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the international community, through the United Nations peacekeeping mission, humanitarian and development relief, and other forms of assistance, is providing a substantial amount of funding that is giving the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo an opportunity to make progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102, but this assistance cannot continue in perpetuity.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Termination of Assistance</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;It is the sense of Congress that the Secretary of State should withhold assistance otherwise available under this Act if the Secretary determines that the Government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo is not making sufficient progress towards accomplishing the policy objectives described in section 102.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 105. WITHHOLDING OF ASSISTANCE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Secretary of State is authorized to withhold assistance made available under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.), other than humanitarian, peacekeeping, and counterterrorism assistance, for a foreign country if the Secretary determines that the government of the foreign country is taking actions to destabilize the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 108&ndash;175, Dec. 12, 2003, 117 Stat. 2482, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Syria Accountability and Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act of 2003&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) On June 24, 2002, President Bush stated &lsquo;Syria must choose the right side in the war on terror by closing terrorist camps and expelling terrorist organizations&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001) mandates that all states &lsquo;refrain from providing any form of support, active or passive, to entities or persons involved in terrorist acts&rsquo;, take &lsquo;the necessary steps to prevent the commission of terrorist acts&rsquo;, and &lsquo;deny safe haven to <!-- PDFPage:471 -->those who finance, plan, support, or commit terrorist acts&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Government of Syria is currently prohibited by United States law from receiving United States assistance because it has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, as determined by the Secretary of State for purposes of section 6(j)(1) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)(1)) and other relevant provisions of law.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Although the Department of State lists Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism and reports that Syria provides &lsquo;safe haven and support to several terrorist groups&rsquo;, fewer United States sanctions apply with respect to Syria than with respect to any other country that is listed as a state sponsor of terrorism.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Terrorist groups, including Hizballah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&mdash;General Command, maintain offices, training camps, and other facilities on Syrian territory, and operate in areas of Lebanon occupied by the Syrian armed forces and receive supplies from Iran through Syria.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) calls for &lsquo;strict respect of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, unity and political independence of Lebanon under the sole and exclusive authority of the Government of Lebanon through the Lebanese Army throughout Lebanon&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Approximately 20,000 Syrian troops and security personnel occupy much of the sovereign territory of Lebanon exerting undue influence upon its government and undermining its political independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Since 1990 the Senate and House of Representatives have passed seven bills and resolutions which call for the withdrawal of Syrian armed forces from Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) On March 3, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell declared that it is the objective of the United States to &lsquo;let Lebanon be ruled by the Lebanese people without the presence of [the Syrian] occupation army&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Large and increasing numbers of the Lebanese people from across the political spectrum in Lebanon have mounted peaceful and democratic calls for the withdrawal of the Syrian Army from Lebanese soil.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Israel has withdrawn all of its armed forces from Lebanon in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 425 (March 19, 1978), as certified by the United Nations Secretary General.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Even in the face of this United Nations certification that acknowledged Israel's full compliance with Security Council Resolution 425, Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah continues to attack Israeli outposts at Shebaa Farms, under the pretense that Shebaa Farms is territory from which Israel was required to withdraw by Security Counsel Resolution 425, and Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah and other militant organizations continue to attack civilian targets in Israel.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Syria will not allow Lebanon&mdash;a sovereign country&mdash;to fulfill its obligation in accordance with Security Council Resolution 425 to deploy its troops to southern Lebanon.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) As a result, the Israeli-Lebanese border and much of southern Lebanon is under the control of Hizballah, which continues to attack Israeli positions, allows Iranian Revolutionary Guards and other militant groups to operate freely in the area, and maintains thousands of rockets along Israel's northern border, destabilizing the entire region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) On February 12, 2003, Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet stated the following with respect to the Syrian- and Iranian-supported Hizballah: &lsquo;[A]s an organization with capability and worldwide presence [it] is [al Qaeda's] equal if not a far more capable organization *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [T]hey're a notch above in many respects, in terms of in their relationship with the Iranians and the training they receive, [which] puts them in a state-sponsored category with a potential for lethality that's quite great.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) In the State of the Union address on January 29, 2002, President Bush declared that the United States will &lsquo;work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) The Government of Syria continues to develop and deploy short- and medium-range ballistic missiles.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) According to the December 2001 unclassified Central Intelligence Agency report entitled &lsquo;Foreign Missile Developments and the Ballistic Missile Threat through 2015&rsquo;, &lsquo;Syria maintains a ballistic missile and rocket force of hundreds of FROG rockets, Scuds, and SS&ndash;21 SRBMs [and] Syria has developed [chemical weapons] warheads for its Scuds&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) The Government of Syria is pursuing the development and production of biological and chemical weapons and has a nuclear research and development program that is cause for concern.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) According to the Central Intelligence Agency's &lsquo;Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions&rsquo;, released January 7, 2003: &lsquo;[Syria] already holds a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin but apparently is trying to develop more toxic and persistent nerve agents. Syria remains dependent on foreign sources for key elements of its [chemical weapons] program, including precursor chemicals and key production equipment. It is highly probable that Syria also is developing an offensive [biological weapons] capability.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) On May 6, 2002, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, stated: &lsquo;The United States also knows that Syria has long had a chemical warfare program. It has a stockpile of the nerve agent sarin and is engaged in research and development of the more toxic and persistent nerve agent VX. Syria, which has signed but not ratified the [Biological Weapons Convention], is pursuing the development of biological weapons and is able to produce at least small amounts of biological warfare agents.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) According to the Central Intelligence Agency's &lsquo;Unclassified Report to Congress on the Acquisition of Technology Relating to Weapons of Mass Destruction and Advanced Conventional Munitions&rsquo;, released January 7, 2003: &lsquo;Russia and Syria have approved a draft cooperative program on cooperation on civil nuclear power. In principal, broader access to Russian expertise provides opportunities for Syria to expand its indigenous capabilities, should it decide to pursue nuclear weapons.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(23) Under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (21 UST 483), which entered force on March 5, 1970, and to which Syria is a party, Syria has undertaken not to acquire or produce nuclear weapons and has accepted full scope safeguards of the International Atomic Energy Agency to detect diversions of nuclear materials from peaceful activities to the production of nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(24) Syria is not a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention or the Biological Weapons Convention, which entered into force on April 29, 1997, and on March 26, 1975, respectively.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(25) Syrian President Bashar Assad promised Secretary of State Powell in February 2001 to end violations of Security Council Resolution 661, which restricted the sale of oil and other commodities by Saddam Hussein's regime, except to the extent authorized by other relevant resolutions, but this pledge was never fulfilled.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(26) Syria's illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil during Saddam Hussein's regime earned Syria $50,000,000 or more per month as Syria continued to sell its own Syrian oil at market prices.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(27) Syria's illegal imports and transshipments of Iraqi oil earned Saddam Hussein's regime $2,000,000 per day.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:472 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(28) On March 28, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld warned: &lsquo;[W]e have information that shipments of military supplies have been crossing the border from Syria into Iraq, including night-vision goggles *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* These deliveries pose a direct threat to the lives of coalition forces. We consider such trafficking as hostile acts, and will hold the Syrian government accountable for such shipments.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(29) According to Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, members of the United Nations are elected as nonpermanent members of the United Nations Security Council with &lsquo;due regard being specially paid, in the first instance to the contribution of members of the United Nations to the maintenance of international peace and security and to other purposes of the Organization&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(30) Despite Article 23(1) of the United Nations Charter, Syria was elected on October 8, 2001, to a 2-year term as a nonpermanent member of the United Nations Security Council beginning January 1, 2002, and served as President of the Security Council during June 2002 and August 2003.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(31) On March 31, 2003, the Syrian Foreign Minister, Farouq al-Sharra, made the Syrian regime's intentions clear when he explicitly stated that &lsquo;Syria's interest is to see the invaders defeated in Iraq&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(32) On April 13, 2003, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld charged that &lsquo;busloads&rsquo; of Syrian fighters entered Iraq with &lsquo;hundreds of thousands of dollars&rsquo; and leaflets offering rewards for dead American soldiers.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(33) On September 16, 2003, the Under Secretary of State for Arms Control and International Security, John Bolton, appeared before the Subcommittee on the Middle East and Central Asia of the Committee on International Relations [now Committee on Foreign Affairs] of the House of Representatives, and underscored Syria's &lsquo;hostile actions&rsquo; toward coalition forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Under Secretary Bolton added that: &lsquo;Syria allowed military equipment to flow into Iraq on the eve of and during the war. Syria permitted volunteers to pass into Iraq to attack and kill our service members during the war, and is still doing so *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* [Syria's] behavior during Operation Iraqi Freedom underscores the importance of taking seriously reports and information on Syria's WMD capabilities.&rsquo;.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(34) During his appearance before the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives on September 25, 2003, Ambassador L. Paul Bremer, III, Administrator of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, stated that out of the 278 third-country nationals who were captured by coalition forces in Iraq, the &lsquo;single largest group are Syrians&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) the Government of Syria should immediately and unconditionally halt support for terrorism, permanently and openly declare its total renunciation of all forms of terrorism, and close all terrorist offices and facilities in Syria, including the offices of Hamas, Hizballah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&mdash;General Command;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the Government of Syria should&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) immediately and unconditionally stop facilitating transit from Syria to Iraq of individuals, military equipment, and all lethal items, except as authorized by the Coalition Provisional Authority or a representative, internationally recognized Iraqi government;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) cease its support for &lsquo;volunteers&rsquo; and terrorists who are traveling from and through Syria into Iraq to launch attacks; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) undertake concrete, verifiable steps to deter such behavior and control the use of territory under Syrian control;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Government of Syria should immediately declare its commitment to completely withdraw its armed forces, including military, paramilitary, and security forces, from Lebanon, and set a firm timetable for such withdrawal;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Government of Lebanon should deploy the Lebanese armed forces to all areas of Lebanon, including South Lebanon, in accordance with United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982), in order to assert the sovereignty of the Lebanese state over all of its territory, and should evict all terrorist and foreign forces from southern Lebanon, including Hizballah and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Government of Syria should halt the development and deployment of medium- and long-range surface-to-surface missiles and cease the development and production of biological and chemical weapons;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Governments of Lebanon and Syria should enter into serious unconditional bilateral negotiations with the Government of Israel in order to realize a full and permanent peace;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the United States should continue to provide humanitarian and educational assistance to the people of Lebanon only through appropriate private, nongovernmental organizations and appropriate international organizations, until such time as the Government of Lebanon asserts sovereignty and control over all of its territory and borders and achieves full political independence, as called for in United Nations Security Council Resolution 520; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) as a violator of several key United Nations Security Council resolutions and as a nation that pursues policies which undermine international peace and security, Syria should not have been permitted to join the United Nations Security Council or serve as the Security Council's President, and should be removed from the Security Council.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 4. STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Syria should bear responsibility for attacks committed by Hizballah and other terrorist groups with offices, training camps, or other facilities in Syria, or bases in areas of Lebanon occupied by Syria;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States will work to deny Syria the ability to support acts of international terrorism and efforts to develop or acquire weapons of mass destruction;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the Secretary of State will continue to list Syria as a state sponsor of terrorism until Syria ends its support for terrorism, including its support of Hizballah and other terrorist groups in Lebanon and its hosting of terrorist groups in Damascus, and comes into full compliance with United States law relating to terrorism and United Nations Security Council Resolution 1373 (September 28, 2001);</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the full restoration of Lebanon's sovereignty, political independence, and territorial integrity is in the national security interest of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Syria is in violation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 520 (September 17, 1982) through its continued occupation of Lebanese territory and its encroachment upon Lebanon's political independence;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Syria's obligation to withdraw from Lebanon is not conditioned upon progress in the Israeli-Syrian or Israeli-Lebanese peace process but derives from Syria's obligation under Security Council Resolution 520;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Syria's acquisition of weapons of mass destruction and ballistic missile programs threaten the security of the Middle East and the national security interests of the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Syria will be held accountable for any harm to Coalition armed forces or to any United States citizen in Iraq if the government of Syria is found to be responsible due to its facilitation of terrorist activities and its shipments of military supplies to Iraq; and</p>
<!-- PDFPage:473 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the United States will not provide any assistance to Syria and will oppose multilateral assistance for Syria until Syria ends all support for terrorism, withdraws its armed forces from Lebanon, and halts the development and deployment of weapons of mass destruction and medium- and long-range surface-to-surface ballistic missiles.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 5. PENALTIES AND AUTHORIZATION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Penalties</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Until the President makes the determination that Syria meets all the requirements described in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (d) and certifies such determination to Congress in accordance with such subsection&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Hostilities in Operation Desert Storm ended on February 28, 1991, and Iraq subsequently accepted the ceasefire conditions specified in United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 (April 3, 1991) requiring Iraq, among other things, to disclose fully and permit the dismantlement of its weapons of mass destruction programs and submit to long-term monitoring and verification of such dismantlement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In April 1993, Iraq orchestrated a failed plot to assassinate former President George Bush during his April 14&ndash;16, 1993, visit to Kuwait.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Since March 1996, Iraq has systematically sought to deny weapons inspectors from the United Nations Special Commission on Iraq (UNSCOM) access to key facilities and documents, has on several occasions endangered the safe operation of UNSCOM helicopters transporting UNSCOM personnel in Iraq, and has persisted in a pattern of deception and concealment regarding the history of its weapons of mass destruction programs.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">African Conflict Resolution</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;381, Oct. 19, 1994, 108 Stat. 3513, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;African Conflict Resolution Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:479 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by more than 20 major civil wars since 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa's future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa's children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Africans have a long tradition of informal mediation. This tradition should be built upon to create effective institutions through which Africans can resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The effectiveness of U.S. support for conflict resolution programs requires coordination and collaboration with multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) African institutions are playing an active role in conflict resolution and mediation utilizing the experience of elder statesmen. Groups such as the All African Council of Churches have assisted in defusing conflicts. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has sought to address the conflict in Liberia by deploying an African peacekeeping force. The Southern African states have been working to prevent a crisis in Lesotho. The Intergovernmental Authority on Desertification and Drought (IGADD) has been engaged in attempting to resolve the conflict in Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The Organization of African Unity, under the leadership of Secretary General Salim Salim, has established a conflict resolution mechanism and has been active in mediation and conflict resolution in several African countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>United States Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress declares, therefore, that a key goal for United States foreign policy should be to help institutionalize conflict resolution capability in Africa.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151&ndash;1. Development assistance policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Principal purpose of bilateral development assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to build and maintain the social and economic institutions necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth and to provide opportunities to improve the quality of life for their people depend primarily upon successfully marshalling their own economic and human resources. The Congress recognizes that the magnitude of these efforts exceeds the resources of developing countries and therefore accepts that there will be a long-term need for wealthy countries to contribute additional resources for development purposes. The United States should take the lead in concert with other nations to mobilize such resources from public and private sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Provision of development resources must be adapted to the needs and capabilities of specific developing countries. United States assistance to countries with low per capita incomes which have limited access to private external resources should primarily be provided on concessional terms. Assistance to other developing countries should generally consist of programs which facilitate their access to private capital markets, investment, and technical skills, whether directly through guarantee or reimbursable programs by the United States Government or indirectly through callable capital provided to the international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Bilateral assistance and United States participation in multilateral institutions shall emphasize programs in support of countries which pur<!-- PDFPage:485 -->sue development strategies designed to meet basic human needs and achieve self-sustaining growth with equity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the principal purpose of United States bilateral development assistance is to help the poor majority of people in developing countries to participate in a process of equitable growth through productive work and to influence decisions that shape their lives, with the goal of increasing their incomes and their access to public services which will enable them to satisfy their basic needs and lead lives of decency, dignity, and hope. Activities shall be emphasized that effectively involve the poor in development by expanding their access to the economy through services and institutions at the local level, increasing their participation in the making of decisions that affect their lives, increasing labor-intensive production and the use of appropriate technology, expanding productive investment and services out from major cities to small towns and rural areas, and otherwise providing opportunities for the poor to improve their lives through their own efforts. Participation of the United States in multilateral institutions shall also place appropriate emphasis on these principles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Form of assistance; principles governing assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance under this part should be used not only for the purpose of transferring financial resources to developing countries, but also to help countries solve development problems in accordance with a strategy that aims to insure wide participation of the poor in the benefits of development on a sustained basis. Moreover, assistance shall be provided in a prompt and effective manner, using appropriate United States institutions for carrying out this strategy. In order to achieve these objectives and the broad objectives set forth in section 2151 of this title and in subsection (a) of this section, bilateral development assistance authorized by this chapter shall be carried out in accordance with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Development is primarily the responsibility of the people of the developing countries themselves. Assistance from the United States shall be used in support of, rather than substitution for, the self-help efforts that are essential to successful development programs and shall be concentrated in those countries that take positive steps to help themselves. Maximum effort shall be made, in the administration of subchapter I of this chapter, to stimulate the involvement of the people in the development process through the encouragement of democratic participation in private and local governmental activities and institution building appropriate to the requirements of the recipient countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Development planning must be the responsibility of each sovereign country. United States assistance should be administered in a collaborative style to support the development goals chosen by each country receiving assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) United States bilateral development assistance should give high priority to undertakings submitted by host governments which directly improve the lives of the poorest of their people and their capacity to participate in the development of their countries, while also helping such governments enhance their planning, technical, and administrative capabilities needed to insure the success of such undertakings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Development assistance provided under this part shall be concentrated in countries which will make the most effective use of such assistance to help satisfy basic human needs of poor people through equitable growth, especially in those countries having the greatest need for outside assistance. In order to make possible consistent and informed judgments in this respect, the President shall assess the commitment and progress of countries in moving toward the objectives and purposes of this part by utilizing criteria, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increase in agricultural productivity per unit of land through small-farm, labor-intensive agriculture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduction of infant mortality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) control of population growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) promotion of greater equality of income distribution, including measures such as more progressive taxation and more equitable returns to small farmers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) reduction of rates of unemployment and underemployment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increase in literacy; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) progress in combating corruption and improving transparency and accountability in the public and private sector.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) United States development assistance should focus on critical problems in those functional sectors which affect the lives of the majority of the people in the developing countries; food production and nutrition; rural development and generation of gainful employment; population planning and health; environment and natural resources; education, development administration, and human resource development; and energy development and production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) United States assistance shall encourage and promote the participation of women in the national economies of developing countries and the improvement of women's status as an important means of promoting the total development effort.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) United States bilateral assistance shall recognize that the prosperity of developing countries and effective development efforts require the adoption of an overall strategy that promotes the development, production, and efficient utilization of energy and, therefore, consideration shall be given to the full implications of such assistance on the price, availability, and consumption of energy in recipient countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) United States cooperation in development should be carried out to the maximum extent possible through the private sector, including those institutions which already have ties in the developing areas, such as educational institutions, cooperatives, credit unions, free labor unions, and private and voluntary agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To the maximum extent practicable, United States private investment should be <!-- PDFPage:486 -->encouraged in economic and social development programs to which the United States lends support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Assistance shall be planned and utilized to encourage regional cooperation by developing countries in the solution of common problems and the development of shared resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Assistance efforts of the United States shall be planned and furnished to the maximum extent practicable in coordination and cooperation with assistance efforts of other countries, including the planning and implementation of programs and projects on a multilateral and multidonor basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) United States bilateral development assistance should be concentrated on projects which do not involve large-scale capital transfers. However, to the extent that such assistance does involve large-scale capital transfers, it should be furnished in association with contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) United States encouragement of policy reforms is necessary if developing countries are to achieve economic growth with equity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Development assistance should, as a fundamental objective, promote private sector activity in open and competitive markets in developing countries, recognizing such activity to be a productive and efficient means of achieving equitable and long term economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) United States cooperation in development should recognize as essential the need of developing countries to have access to appropriate technology in order to improve food and water, health and housing, education and employment, and agriculture and industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) United States assistance should focus on establishing and upgrading the institutional capacities of developing countries in order to promote long term development. An important component of institution building involves training to expand the human resource potential of people in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Economic reform and development of effective institutions of democratic governance are mutually reinforcing. The successful transition of a developing country is dependent upon the quality of its economic and governance institutions. Rule of law, mechanisms of accountability and transparency, security of person, property, and investments, are but a few of the critical governance and economic reforms that underpin the sustainability of broad-based economic growth. Programs in support of such reforms strengthen the capacity of people to hold their governments accountable and to create economic opportunity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Worldwide cooperative effort to overcome aspects of absolute poverty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, recognizing the desirability of overcoming the worst aspects of absolute poverty by the end of this century by, among other measures, substantially lowering infant mortality and birth rates, and increasing life expectancy, food production, literacy, and employment, encourages the President to explore with other countries, through all appropriate channels, the feasibility of a worldwide cooperative effort to overcome the worst aspects of absolute poverty and to assure self-reliant growth in the developing countries by the year 2000.</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization to President to furnish assistance; appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In recognition of the fact that the great majority of the people of developing countries live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture and agricultural-related pursuits for their livelihood, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:487 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to alleviate starvation, hunger, and malnutrition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to expand significantly the provision of basic services to rural poor people to enhance their capacity for self-help; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to help create productive farm and off-farm employment in rural areas to provide a more viable economic base and enhance opportunities for improved incomes, living standards, and contributions by rural poor people to the economic and social development of their countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1987. Of these amounts, the President may use such amounts as he deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of section 316 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1980. Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year 1987, not less than $2,000,000 shall be available only for the purpose of controlling and eradicating amblyomma variegatum (heartwater) in bovine animals in the Caribbean.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use of assistance primarily in aid of rural poor; multilateral infrastructure projects; forestry projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Assistance provided under this section shall be used primarily for activities which are specifically designed to increase the productivity and income of the rural poor, through such means as creation and strengthening of local institutions linked to the regional and national levels; organization of a system of financial institutions which provide both savings and credit services to the poor; stimulation of small, labor-intensive enterprises in rural towns; improvement of marketing facilities and systems; expansion of rural infrastructure and utilities such as farm-to-market roads, water management systems, land improvement, energy, and storage facilities; establishment of more equitable and more secure land tenure arrangements; and creation and strengthening of systems to provide other services and supplies needed by farmers, such as extension, research, training, fertilizer, water, forestry, soil conservation, and improved seed, in ways which assure access to them by small farmers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In circumstances where development of major infrastructure is necessary to achieve the objectives set forth in this section, assistance for that purpose should be furnished under this part in association with significant contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework. Infrastructure projects so assisted should be complemented by other measures to ensure that the benefits of the infrastructure reach the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress recognizes that the accelerating loss of forests and tree cover in developing countries undermines and offsets efforts to improve agricultural production and nutrition and otherwise to meet the basic human needs of the poor. Deforestation results in increased flooding, reduction in water supply for agricultural capacity, loss of firewood and needed wood products, and loss of valuable plants and animals. In order to maintain and increase forest resources, the President is authorized to provide assistance under this section for forestry projects which are essential to fulfill the fundamental purposes of this section. Emphasis shall be given to community woodlots, agroforestry, reforestation, protection of watershed forests, and more effective forest management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increased agricultural production in least developed countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the greatest potential for significantly expanding availability of food for people in rural areas and augmenting world food production at relatively low cost lies in increasing the productivity of small farmers who constitute a majority of the agricultural producers in developing countries. Increasing the emphasis on rural development and expanded food production in the poorest nations of the developing world is a matter of social justice and a principal element contributing to broadly based economic growth, as well as an important factor in alleviating inflation in the industrialized countries. In the allocation of funds under this section, special attention shall be given to increasing agricultural production in countries which have been designated as &ldquo;least developed&rdquo; by the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination with population planning and health programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance provided under this section shall also be used in coordination with programs carried out under section 2151b of this title to help improve nutrition of the people of developing countries through encouragement of increased production of crops with greater nutritional value; improvement of planning, research, and education with respect to nutrition, particularly with reference to improvement and expanded use of indigenously produced foodstuffs; and the undertaking of pilot or demonstration programs explicitly addressing the problem of malnutrition of poor and vulnerable people. In particular, the President is encouraged&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to devise and carry out in partnership with developing countries a strategy for programs of nutrition and health improvement for mothers and children, including breast feeding; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to provide technical, financial, and material support to individuals or groups at the local level for such programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Use of local currency proceeds from sales of commodities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Local currency proceeds from sales of commodities provided under the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.] which are owned by foreign governments shall be used whenever practicable to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) National food security policies and programs; bilateral and multilateral assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to enhance their national food security deserves encouragement as a matter of United States development assistance policy. <!-- PDFPage:488 -->Measures complementary to assistance for expanding food production in developing countries are needed to help assure that food becomes increasingly available on a regular basis to the poor in such countries. Therefore, United States bilateral assistance under this chapter and the Food for Peace Act [7 U.S.C. 1691 et seq.], and United States participation in multilateral institutions, shall emphasize policies and programs which assist developing countries to increase their national food security by improving their food policies and management and by strengthening national food reserves, with particular concern for the needs of the poor, through measures encouraging domestic production, building national food reserves, expanding available storage facilities, reducing postharvest food losses, and improving food distribution.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) International Fund for Agricultural Development; participation and contributions; availability of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to carry out the purposes of this section, the President may continue United States participation in and may make contributions to the International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Of the aggregate amount authorized to be appropriated to carry out subchapter I of this chapter, up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and up to $50,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 may be made available, by appropriation or by transfer, for United States contributions to the second replenishment of the International Fund for Agricultural Development.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151b. Population planning and health programs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that poor health conditions and uncontrolled population growth can vitiate otherwise successful development efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Large families in developing countries are the result of complex social and economic factors which change relatively slowly among the poor majority least affected by economic progress, as well as the result of a lack of effective birth control. Therefore, effective family planning depends upon economic and social change as well as the delivery of services and is often a matter of political and religious sensitivity. While every country has the right to determine its own policies with respect to population growth, voluntary population planning programs can make a substantial contribution to economic development, higher living standards, and improved health and nutrition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Good health conditions are a principal element in improved quality of life and contribute to the individual's capacity to participate in the development process, while poor health and debilitating disease can limit productivity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance for voluntary population planning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to increase the opportunities and motivation for family planning and to reduce the rate of population growth, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms <!-- PDFPage:490 -->and conditions as he may determine, for voluntary population planning. In addition to the provision of family planning information and services, including also information and services which relate to and support natural family planning methods, and the conduct of directly relevant demographic research, population planning programs shall emphasize motivation for small families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance for health programs; special health needs of children and mothers; Child Survival Fund; promotion of immunization and oral rehydration; control of AIDS and tuberculosis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to contribute to improvements in the health of the greatest number of poor people in developing countries, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for health programs. Assistance under this subsection shall be used primarily for basic integrated health services, safe water and sanitation, disease prevention and control, and related health planning and research. This assistance shall emphasize self-sustaining community-based health programs by means such as training of health auxiliary and other appropriate personnel, support for the establishment and evaluation of projects that can be replicated on a broader scale, measures to improve management of health programs, and other services and supplies to support health and disease prevention programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In carrying out the purposes of this subsection, the President shall promote, encourage, and undertake activities designed to deal directly with the special health needs of children and mothers. Such activities should utilize simple, available technologies which can significantly reduce childhood mortality, such as improved and expanded immunization programs, oral rehydration to combat diarrhoeal diseases, and education programs aimed at improving nutrition and sanitation and at promoting child spacing. In carrying out this paragraph, guidance shall be sought from knowledgeable health professionals from outside the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter. In addition to government-to-government programs, activities pursuant to this paragraph should include support for appropriate activities of the types described in this paragraph which are carried out by international organizations (which may include international organizations receiving funds under part III of this subchapter) and by private and voluntary organizations, and should include encouragement to other donors to support such types of activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In addition to amounts otherwise available for such purpose, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 for use in carrying out this paragraph. Amounts appropriated under this subparagraph are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Appropriations pursuant to subparagraph (B) may be referred to as the &ldquo;Child Survival Fund&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress recognizes that the promotion of primary health care is a major objective of the foreign assistance program. The Congress further recognizes that simple, relatively low cost means already exist to reduce incidence of communicable diseases among children, mothers, and infants. The promotion of vaccines for immunization, and salts for oral rehydration, therefore, is an essential feature of the health assistance program. To this end, the Congress expects the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter to set as a goal the protection of not less than 80 percent of all children, in those countries in which such agency has established development programs, from immunizable diseases by January 1, 1991. Of the aggregate amounts made available for fiscal year 1987 to carry out paragraph (2) of this subsection (relating to the Child Survival Fund) and to carry out subsection (c) of this section (relating to development assistance for health), $50,000,000 shall be used to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) <cap-smallcap>Relationship to other laws</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Assistance made available under this subsection and sections 2151b&ndash;2, 2151b&ndash;3, and 2151b&ndash;4 of this title, and assistance made available under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter to carry out the purposes of this subsection and the provisions cited in this paragraph, may be made available notwithstanding any other provision of law that restricts assistance to foreign countries, except for the provisions of this subsection, the provisions of law cited in this paragraph, subsection (f) of this section, section 2394&ndash;1 of this title, and provisions of law that limit assistance to organizations that support or participate in a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization included under the Child Survival and Health Programs Fund heading in the Consolidated Appropriations Resolution, 2003 (Public Law 108&ndash;7).</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) Assistance under this part shall be administered so as to give particular attention to the interrelationship between (A) population growth, and (B) development and overall improvement in living standards in developing countries, and to the impact of all programs, projects, and activities on population growth. All appropriate activities proposed for financing under this part shall be designed to build motivation for smaller families through modification of economic and social conditions supportive of the desire for large families, in programs such as education in and out of school, nutrition, disease control, maternal and child health services, improvements in the status and employment of women, agricultural production, rural development, and assistance to the urban poor, and through community-based development programs which give recognition to people motivated to limit the size of their families. Population planning programs shall be coordinated with other programs aimed at reducing the infant mortality rate, providing better nutrition for pregnant women and infants, and raising the standard of living of the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Since the problems of malnutrition, disease, and rapid population growth are closely related, planning for assistance to be provided under subsections (b) and (c) of this section and <!-- PDFPage:491 -->under section 2151a of this title shall be coordinated to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Assistance provided under this section shall emphasize low-cost integrated delivery systems for health, nutrition, and family planning for the poorest people, with particular attention to the needs of mothers and young children, using paramedical and auxiliary medical personnel, clinics and health posts, commercial distribution systems, and other modes of community outreach.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Research and analysis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Health and population research and analysis carried out under this chapter shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be undertaken to the maximum extent practicable in developing countries by developing country personnel, linked as appropriate with private and governmental biomedical research facilities within the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) take account of the special needs of the poor people of developing countries in the determination of research priorities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make extensive use of field testing to adapt basic research to local conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President is authorized to study the complex factors affecting population growth in developing countries and to identify factors which might motivate people to plan family size or to space their children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on use of funds for performance or research respecting abortions or involuntary sterilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilizations as a method of family planning or to coerce or provide any financial incentive to any person to undergo sterilizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for any biomedical research which relates, in whole or in part, to methods of, or the performance of, abortions or involuntary sterilization as a means of family planning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $205,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $180,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since the development of antibiotics in the 1950s, tuberculosis has been largely controlled in the United States and the Western World.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Due to societal factors, including growing urban decay, inadequate health care systems, persistent poverty, overcrowding, and malnutrition, as well as medical factors, including the HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of multi-drug resistant strains of tuberculosis, tuberculosis has again become a leading and growing cause of adult deaths in the developing world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the World Health Organization&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) in 1998, about 1,860,000 people worldwide died of tuberculosis-related illnesses;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) one-third of the world's total population is infected with tuberculosis; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) tuberculosis is the world's leading killer of women between 15 and 44 years old and is a leading cause of children becoming orphans.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Because of the ease of transmission of tuberculosis, its international persistence and growth pose a direct public health threat to those nations that had previously largely controlled the disease. This is complicated in the United States by the growth of the homeless population, the rate of incarceration, international travel, immigration, and HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) With nearly 40 percent of the tuberculosis cases in the United States attributable to foreign-born persons, tuberculosis will never be controlled in the United States until it is controlled abroad.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The means exist to control tuberculosis through screening, diagnosis, treatment, patient compliance, monitoring, and ongoing review of outcomes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Efforts to control tuberculosis are complicated by several barriers, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) the labor intensive and lengthy process involved in screening, detecting, and treating the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) a lack of funding, trained personnel, and medicine in virtually every nation with a high rate of the disease;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) the unique circumstances in each country, which requires the development and implementation of country-specific programs; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) the risk of having a bad tuberculosis program, which is worse than having no tuberculosis <!-- PDFPage:493 -->program because it would significantly increase the risk of the development of more widespread drug-resistant strains of the disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Eliminating the barriers to the international control of tuberculosis through a well-structured, comprehensive, and coordinated worldwide effort would be a significant step in dealing with the increasing public health problem posed by the disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The World Health Organization estimates that there are 300,000,000 to 500,000,000 cases of malaria each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) According to the World Health Organization, more than 1,000,000 persons are estimated to die due to malaria each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) According to the National Institutes of Health, about 40 percent of the world's population is at risk of becoming infected.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) About half of those who die each year from malaria are children under 9 years of age.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Malaria kills one child each 30 seconds.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Although malaria is a public health problem in more than 90 countries, more than 90 percent of all malaria cases are in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) In addition to Africa, large areas of Central and South America, Haiti and the Dominican Republic, the Indian subcontinent, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East are high risk malaria areas.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Congress recognizes the growing international problem of tuberculosis and the impact its continued existence has on those countries that had previously largely controlled the disease.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Congress further recognizes that the means exist to control and treat tuberculosis through expanded use of the DOTS (Directly Observed Treatment Short-course) treatment strategy, including DOTS-Plus to address multi-drug resistant tuberculosis, and adequate investment in newly created mechanisms to increase access to treatment, including the Global Tuberculosis Drug Facility established in 2001 pursuant to the Amsterdam Declaration to Stop TB and the Global Alliance for TB Drug Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is a major objective of the foreign assistance program of the United States to control tuberculosis. In all countries in which the Government of the United States has established development programs, particularly in countries with the highest burden of tuberculosis and other countries with high rates of tuberculosis, the United States should support the objectives of the Global Plan to Stop TB, including through achievement of the following goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Reduce by half the tuberculosis death and disease burden from the 1990 baseline.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Sustain or exceed the detection of at least 70 percent of sputum smear-positive cases of tuberculosis and the successful treatment of at least 85 percent of the cases detected in countries with established United States Agency for International Development tuberculosis programs.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151d. Development of indigenous energy resources</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Congress finds that energy development and production are vital elements in the development process, that energy shortages in developing countries severely limit the development process in such countries, that two-thirds of the developing countries which import oil depend on it for at least 90 percent of the energy which their economies require, and that the dramatic increase in world oil prices since 1973 has resulted in considerable economic hardship for many developing countries. The Congress is concerned that the value and purpose of much of the assistance provided to developing countries under sections 2151a, 2151b, and 2151c of this title are undermined by the inability of many developing countries to satisfy their energy requirements. Unless the energy deficit of the developing countries can be narrowed by more fully exploiting indigenous sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, and coal, scarce foreign exchange will increasingly have to be diverted to oil imports, primarily to the detriment of long-term development and economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Congress recognizes that many developing countries lack access to the financial resources and technology necessary to locate, explore, and develop indigenous energy resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Congress declares that there is potential for at least a moderate increase by 1990 in the production of energy for commercial use in the developing countries which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In addition, there is a compelling need for vigorous efforts to improve the available data on the location, scale, and commercial exploitability of potential oil, natural gas, and coal reserves in developing countries, especially those which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Congress further declares that there are many benefits to be gained by the developing countries and by the United States and other developed countries through expanded efforts to expedite the location, exploration, and development of potential sources of energy in developing countries. These benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<!-- PDFPage:505 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The world's energy supply would be increased and the fear of abrupt depletion would be lessened with new energy production. This could have a positive impact upon energy prices in international markets as well as a positive effect upon the balance of payments problems of many developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Diversification of the world's supplies of energy from fossil fuels would make all countries, developing and developed, less susceptible to supply interruptions and arbitrary production and pricing policies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Even a moderate increase in energy production in the developing countries would improve their ability to expand commercial trade, foreign investment, and technology transfer possibilities with the United States and other developed countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Assistance for the production of energy from indigenous resources, as authorized by subsection (b) of this section, would be of direct benefit to the poor in developing countries because of the overwhelming impact of imported energy costs upon the lives of the poor and their ability to participate in development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress also finds that energy production from renewable, decentralized sources and energy conservation are vital elements in the development process. Inadequate access by the poor to energy sources as well as the prospect of depleted fossil fuel reserves and higher energy prices require an enhanced effort to expand the energy resources of developing countries through greater emphasis on renewable sources. Renewable and decentralized energy technologies have particular applicability for the poor, especially in rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General assistance authority; cooperative programs in energy production and conservation; program goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to help developing countries alleviate their energy problems by improving their ability to use indigenous energy resources to produce the energy needed by their economies, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, to enable such countries to prepare for and undertake development of their energy resources. Such assistance may include data collection and analysis, the training of skilled personnel, research on and development of suitable energy sources, and pilot projects to test new methods of energy production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President is authorized to furnish assistance under this part for cooperative programs with developing countries in energy production and conservation, through research on and development and use of small-scale, decentralized, renewable energy sources for rural areas carried out as integral parts of rural development efforts in accordance with section 2151a of this title. Such programs shall also be directed toward the earliest practicable development and use of energy technologies which are environmentally acceptable, require minimum capital investment, are most acceptable to and affordable by the people using them, are simple and inexpensive to use and maintain, and are transferable from one region of the world to another. Such programs may include research on and the development, demonstration, and application of suitable energy technologies (including use of wood); analysis of energy uses, needs, and resources; training and institutional development; and scientific interchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative coordination of planning and implementation of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter and the Department of Energy shall coordinate with one another, to the maximum extent possible, the planning and implementation of energy programs under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assistance for programs of technical cooperation and development, research, etc.</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that if current trends in the degradation of natural resources in developing countries continue, they will severely undermine the best efforts to meet basic human needs, to achieve sustained economic growth, and to prevent international tension and conflict. The Congress also finds that the world faces enormous, urgent, and complex problems, with respect to natural resources, which require new forms of cooperation between the United States and developing countries to prevent such problems from becoming unmanageable. It is, therefore, in the economic and security interest of the United States to provide leadership both in thoroughly reassessing policies relating to natural resources and the environment, and in cooperating extensively with developing countries in order to achieve environmentally sound development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance authority and emphasis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to address the serious problems described in subsection (a) of this section, the President is authorized to furnish assistance under subchapter I of this chapter for developing and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to protect and manage their environment and natural resources. Special efforts shall be made to maintain and where possible to restore the land, vegetation, water, wildlife, and other resources upon which depend economic growth and human well-being, especially of the poor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation considerations applicable to programs and projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President, in implementing programs and projects under this part and part X of this subchapter, shall take fully into account the impact of such programs and projects upon the environment and natural resources of developing countries. Subject to such procedures as the President considers appropriate, the President shall require all agencies and officials responsible for programs or projects under this part and part X of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to prepare and take fully into account an environmental impact statement for any program or project under this part and part X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of the global commons outside the jurisdiction of any country, the environment of the United States, or other aspects of the environment which the President may specify; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prepare and take fully into account an environmental assessment of any proposed program or project under this part and part X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of any foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such agencies and officials should, where appropriate, use local technical resources in preparing environmental impact statements and environmental assessments pursuant to this subsection.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151p&ndash;1. Tropical forests</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Importance of forests and tree cover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In enacting section 2151a(b)(3) of this title the Congress recognized the importance of forests and tree cover to the developing countries. The Congress is particularly concerned about the continuing and accelerating alteration, destruction, and loss of tropical forests in developing countries, which pose a serious threat to development and the environment. Tropical forest destruction and loss&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) result in shortages of wood, especially wood for fuel; loss of biologically productive wetlands; siltation of lakes, reservoirs, and irrigation systems; floods; destruction of indigenous peoples; extinction of plant and animal species; reduced capacity for food production; and loss of genetic resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) can result in desertification and destabilization of the earth's climate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Properly managed tropical forests provide a sustained flow of resources essential to the economic growth of developing countries, as well as genetic resources of value to developed and developing countries alike.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The concerns expressed in subsection (a) of this section and the recommendations of the United States Interagency Task Force on Tropical Forests shall be given high priority by the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in formulating and carrying out programs and policies with respect to developing countries, including those relating to bilateral and multilateral assistance and those relating to private sector activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in seeking opportunities to coordinate public and private development and investment activities which affect forests in developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance to developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing assistance to developing countries, the President shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Place a high priority on conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which stress the importance of conserving and sustainably managing forest resources for the long-term economic benefit of those countries, as well as the irreversible losses associated with forest destruction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which identify and focus on policies of those countries which directly or indirectly contribute to deforestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and activities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which offer employment and income alternatives to those who otherwise would cause destruction and loss of forests, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which help developing countries identify and implement alternatives to colonizing forested areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the fullest extent feasible, support training programs, educational efforts, and the establishment or strengthening of institutions which increase the capacity of developing countries to formulate forest policies, engage in relevant land-use planning, and otherwise improve the management of their forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To the fullest extent feasible, help end destructive slash-and-burn agriculture by supporting stable and productive farming practices in areas already cleared or degraded and on lands which inevitably will be settled, with special emphasis on demonstrating the feasibility of agroforestry and other techniques <!-- PDFPage:518 -->which use technologies and methods suited to the local environment and traditional agricultural techniques and feature close consultation with and involvement of local people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To the fullest extent feasible, help conserve forests which have not yet been degraded, by helping to increase production on lands already cleared or degraded through support of reforestation, fuelwood, and other sustainable forestry projects and practices, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and other activities to conserve forested watersheds and rehabilitate those which have been deforested, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To the fullest extent feasible, support training, research, and other actions which lead to sustainable and more environmentally sound practices for timber harvesting, removal, and processing, including reforestation, soil conservation, and other activities to rehabilitate degraded forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To the fullest extent feasible, support research to expand knowledge of tropical forests and identify alternatives which will prevent forest destruction, loss, or degradation, including research in agroforestry, sustainable management of natural forests, small-scale farms and gardens, small-scale animal husbandry, wider application of adopted traditional practices, and suitable crops and crop combinations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) To the fullest extent feasible, conserve biological diversity in forest areas by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) supporting and cooperating with United States Government agencies, other donors (both bilateral and multilateral), and other appropriate governmental, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental organizations in efforts to identify, establish, and maintain a representative network of protected tropical forest ecosystems on a worldwide basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whenever appropriate, making the establishment of protected areas a condition of support for activities involving forest clearance or degradation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) helping developing countries identify tropical forest ecosystems and species in need of protection and establish and maintain appropriate protected areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in efforts to increase the awareness of United States Government agencies and other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, of the immediate and long-term value of tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) To the fullest extent feasible, utilize the resources and abilities of all relevant United States Government agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Require that any program or project under this part significantly affecting tropical forests (including projects involving the planting of exotic plant species)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be based upon careful analysis of the alternatives available to achieve the best sustainable use of the land, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take full account of the environmental impacts of the proposed activities on biological diversity,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as provided for in the environmental procedures of the Agency for International Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Deny assistance under this part for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the procurement or use of logging equipment, unless an environmental assessment indicates that all timber harvesting operations involved will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which minimizes forest destruction and that the proposed activity will produce positive economic benefits and sustainable forest management systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) actions which significantly degrade national parks or similar protected areas which contain tropical forests or introduce exotic plants or animals into such areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) Deny assistance under this part for the following activities unless an environmental assessment indicates that the proposed activity will contribute significantly and directly to improving the livelihood of the rural poor and will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which supports sustainable development:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Activities which would result in the conversion of forest lands to the rearing of livestock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The construction, upgrading, or maintenance of roads (including temporary haul roads for logging or other extractive industries) which pass through relatively undegraded forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The colonization of forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The construction of dams or other water control structures which flood relatively undegraded forest lands.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the survival of many animal and plant species is endangered by over-hunting, by the presence of toxic chemicals in water, air and soil, and by the destruction of habitats. The Congress further finds that the extinction of animal and plant species is an irreparable loss with potentially serious environmental and economic consequences for developing and developed countries alike. Accordingly, the preservation of animal and plant species through the regulation of the hunting and trade in endangered species, through limitations on the pollution of natural ecosystems, and through the protection of wildlife habitats should be an important objective of the United States development assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Remedial measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to preserve biological diversity, the President is authorized to furnish assistance under subchapter I of this chapter, notwithstanding section 2420 of this title, to assist countries in protecting and maintaining wildlife habitats and in developing sound wildlife management and plant conservation programs. Special efforts should be made to establish and maintain wildlife sanctuaries, reserves, and parks; to enact and enforce anti-poaching measures; and to identify, study, and catalog animal and plant species, especially in tropical environments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funding level</h4>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151u. Private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives in overseas development</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional finding of importance of participation by private and voluntary organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the participation of rural and urban poor people in their countries&rsquo; development can be assisted and accelerated in an effective manner through an increase in activities planned and carried out by private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives. Such organizations and cooperatives, embodying the American spirit of self-help and assistance to others to improve their lives and incomes, constitute an important means of mobilizing private American financial and human resources to benefit poor people in developing countries. The Congress declares that it is in the interest of the United States that such organizations and cooperatives expand their overseas development efforts without compromising their private and independent nature. The Congress further declares that the financial resources of such organizations and cooperatives should be supplemented by the contribution of public funds for the purpose of undertaking development activities in accordance with the principles set forth in section 2151&ndash;1 of this title and, if necessary and determined on a case-by-case basis, for the purpose of sharing the cost of developing programs related to such activities. The Congress urges the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, in implementing programs authorized under subchapter I of this chapter, to draw on the resource of private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives to plan and carry out development activities and to establish simplified procedures for the development and approval of programs to be carried out by such private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives as have demonstrated a capacity to undertake effective development activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of transportation charges on shipments by American National Red Cross and United States voluntary agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to further the efficient use of United States voluntary contributions for development, relief, and rehabilitation of friendly peoples, the President is authorized to use funds made available for the purposes of this part and part X of this subchapter to pay transportation charges on shipments by the American National Red Cross and by United States voluntary agencies registered with the Agency for International Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reimbursement for transportation charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursement under this section may be provided for transportation charges on shipments from United States ports, or in the case of excess or surplus property supplied by the United States from foreign ports, to ports of entry abroad or to points of entry abroad in cases (1) of landlocked countries, (2) where ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disturbances, (3) where carriers to a specified country are unavailable, or (4) where a substantial savings in costs or time can be effected by the utilization of points of entry other than ports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Arrangements with receiving country for free entry of shipments and for availability of local currency to defray transportation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where practicable, the President shall make arrangements with the receiving country for free entry of such shipments and for the making available by the country of local currencies for the purpose of defraying the transportation costs of such shipments from the port or point of entry of the receiving country to the designated shipping point of the consignee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuation of support for programs in countries antedating prohibitions on assistance; national interest considerations; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prohibitions on assistance to countries contained in this chapter or any other Act shall not be construed to prohibit assistance by the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter in support of programs of private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives already being supported prior to the date such prohibition becomes applicable. The President shall take into consideration, in any case in which statutory prohibitions on assistance would be applicable but for this subsection, whether continuation of support for such programs is in the national interest of the United States. If the President continues such support after such date, he shall prepare and transmit, not later than one year after such date, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report setting forth the reasons for such continuation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Funds for private and voluntary organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1989, funds in an amount not less than thirteen and one half percent of the aggregate amount appropriated for that fiscal year to carry out sections <!-- PDFPage:523 -->2151a(a), 2151b(b), 2151b(c), 2151c, 2151d, 2151s,<sup><a href="#2151u_1_target" name="2151u_1">1</a></sup> and 2292 of this title shall be made available for the activities of private and voluntary organizations, and the President shall seek to channel funds in an amount not less than 16 percent of such aggregate amount for the activities of private and voluntary organizations. Funds made available under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter for the activities of private and voluntary organizations may be considered in determining compliance with the requirements of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Repealed. Pub. L. 105&ndash;277, div. A, &sect;101(d) [title II], Oct. 21, 1998, 112 Stat. 2681&ndash;150, 2681&ndash;156</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Promotion of democratic cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that, in addition to their role in social and economic development, cooperatives provide an opportunity for people to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Therefore, assistance under this part shall be provided to rural and urban cooperatives which offer large numbers of low- and middle-income people in developing countries an opportunity to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Such assistance shall be designed to encourage the adoption of self-help, private sector cooperative techniques and practices which have been successful in the United States.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151v. Aid to relatively least developed countries</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Characterization of least developed countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Relatively least developed countries (as determined on the basis of criteria comparable to those used for the United Nations General Assembly list of &ldquo;least developed countries&rdquo;) are characterized by extreme poverty, very limited infrastructure, and limited administrative capacity to implement basic human needs growth strategies. In such countries special measures may be necessary to insure the full effectiveness of assistance furnished under subchapter I of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance on grant basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of promoting economic growth in these countries, the President is authorized and encouraged to make assistance under this part available on a grant basis to the maximum extent that is consistent with the attainment of United States development objectives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of principal and interest on prior liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress recognizes that the relatively least developed countries have virtually no access to private international capital markets. Insofar as possible, prior assistance terms should be consistent with present grant assistance terms for relatively least developed countries. Therefore, notwithstanding section 2370(r) of this title and section 321 of the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1975 but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the President on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of the country for financial resources and the commitment of the country to the development objectives set forth in sections 2151 and 2151&ndash;1 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may permit a relatively least developed country to place amounts, which would otherwise be paid to the United States as payments on principal or interest on liability incurred by that country under subchapter I of this chapter (or any predecessor legislation) into local currency accounts (in equivalent amounts of local currencies as determined by the official exchange rate for United States dollars) for use by the relatively least developed country, with the concurrence of the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, for activities which are consistent with section 2151&ndash;1 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may waive interest payments on liability incurred by a relatively least developed coun<!-- PDFPage:525 -->try under subchapter I of this chapter (or any predecessor legislation) if the President determines that that country would be unable to use for development purposes the equivalent amounts of local currencies which could be made available under subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The aggregate amount of interest waived and interest and principal paid into local currency accounts under this subsection in any fiscal year may not exceed the amount approved for such purpose in an Act appropriating funds to carry out this part for that fiscal year, which amount may not exceed the amount authorized to be so approved by the annual authorizing legislation for development assistance programs. Amounts due and payable during fiscal year 1981 to the United States from relatively least developed countries on loans made under this subchapter (or any predecessor legislation) are authorized to be approved for use, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, in an amount not to exceed $10,845,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In exercising the authority granted by this subsection, the President should act in concert with other creditor countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of requirement of contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may on a case-by-case basis waive the requirement of section 2151h(a) of this title for financial or &ldquo;in kind&rdquo; contributions in the case of programs, projects, or activities in relatively least developed countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of time limitations on aid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 2151h(b) of this title shall not apply with respect to grants to relatively least developed countries.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that illicit narcotics cultivation is related to overall development problems and that the vast majority of all individuals employed in the cultivation of illicit <!-- PDFPage:526 -->narcotics reside in the developing countries and are among the poorest of the poor in those countries and that therefore the ultimate success of any effort to eliminate illicit narcotics production depends upon the availability of alternative economic opportunities for those individuals, upon other factors which assistance under this part could address, as well as upon direct narcotics control efforts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program planning priorities; resource utilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In planning programs of assistance under this part, and part X of this subchapter, and under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter for countries in which there is illicit narcotics cultivation, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should give priority consideration to programs which would help reduce illicit narcotics cultivation by stimulating broader development opportunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter may utilize resources for activities aimed at increasing awareness of the effects of production and trafficking of illicit narcotics on source and transit countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In furtherance of the purposes of this section, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall cooperate fully with, and share its expertise in development matters with, other agencies of the United States Government involved in narcotics control activities abroad.</p>

<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The American people abhor torture by any government or person. The existence of torture creates a <!-- PDFPage:531 -->climate of fear and international insecurity that affects all people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Torture is the deliberate mental and physical damage caused by governments to individuals to destroy individual personality and terrorize society. The effects of torture are long term. Those effects can last a lifetime for the survivors and affect future generations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) By eliminating the leadership of their opposition and frightening the general public, repressive governments often use torture as a weapon against democracy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Torture survivors remain under physical and psychological threats, especially in communities where the perpetrators are not brought to justice. In many nations, even those who treat torture survivors are threatened with reprisals, including torture, for carrying out their ethical duty to provide care. Both the survivors of torture and their treatment providers should be accorded protection from further repression.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering the United States have been victims of torture. Those claiming asylum deserve prompt consideration of their applications for political asylum to minimize their insecurity and sense of danger. Many torture survivors now live in the United States. They should be provided with the rehabilitation services which would enable them to become productive members of our communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored and other acts of torture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers, together with overall efforts to eliminate torture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect their families, the United States can help to heal the effects of torture and prevent its use around the world.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. DEFINITION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;As used in this Act, the term &lsquo;torture&rsquo; has the meaning given the term in section 2340(1) of title 18, United States Code, and includes the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence by a person acting under the color of law upon another person under his custody or physical control.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2152f. Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) There are more than 143,000,000 orphans living&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2152f_1_target" name="2152f_1">1</a></sup> sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean. Of this number, approximately 16,200,000 children have lost both parents.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been hardest hit. The pandemic is deepening poverty in entire communities, and is jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children in affected countries. It is estimated that 14,000,000 children have lost one or both parents to AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for human welfare, development, and political stability that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Extended families and local communities are struggling to meet the basic needs of orphans and vulnerable children by providing food, health care including treatment of children living with HIV/AIDS, education expenses, and clothing.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Famines, natural disasters, chronic poverty, ongoing conflicts, and civil wars in developing countries are adversely affecting children in these countries, the vast majority of whom currently do not receive humanitarian assistance or other support from the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) The United States Government administers various assistance programs for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. In order to improve targeting and programming of resources, the United States Agency for International Development should develop methods to adequately track the overall number of orphans and other vulnerable children receiving assistance, the kinds of programs for such children by sector and location, and any other such related data and analysis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The United States Agency for International Development should improve its capabilities to deliver assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries through partnerships with private volunteer organizations, including community and faith-based organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) The United States Agency for International Development should be the primary United States Government agency responsible for identifying and assisting orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) Providing assistance to such children is an important expression of the humanitarian concern and tradition of the people of the United States.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 109&ndash;95, &sect;2, Nov. 8, 2005, 119 Stat. 2111, provided that: &ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) As of July 2004, there were more than 143,000,000 children living in sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean who were identified as orphans, having lost one or both of their parents. Of this number, approximately 16,200,000 children were identified as double orphans, having lost both parents&mdash;the vast majority of whom died of AIDS. These children often are disadvantaged in numerous and devastating ways and most households with orphans cannot meet the basic needs of health care, food, clothing, and educational expenses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) It is estimated that 121,000,000 children worldwide do not attend school and that the majority of such children are young girls. According to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), orphans are less likely to be in school and more likely to be working full time.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) School food programs, including take-home rations, in developing countries provide strong incentives for children to remain in school and continue their education. School food programs can reduce short-term hunger, improve cognitive functions, and enhance learning, behavior, and achievement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Financial barriers, such as school fees and other costs of education, prevent many orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries from attending school. Providing children with free primary school education, while simultaneously ensuring that adequate resources exist for teacher training and infrastructure, would help more orphans and other vulnerable children obtain a quality education.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The trauma that results from the loss of a parent can trigger behavior problems of aggression or emotional withdrawal and negatively affect a child's performance in school and the child's social relations. Children living in families affected by HIV/AIDS or who have been orphaned by AIDS often face stigmatization and discrimination. Providing culturally appropriate psychosocial support to such children can assist them in successfully accepting and adjusting to their circumstances.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries routinely are denied their inheritance or encounter difficulties in claiming the land and other property which they have inherited. Even when the inheritance rights of women and children are spelled out in law, such rights are difficult to claim and are seldom enforced. In many countries it is difficult or impossible for a widow, even if she has young children, to claim property after the death of her husband.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has had a devastating affect on children and is deepening poverty in entire communities and jeopardizing the health, safety, and survival of all children in affected areas.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) The HIV/AIDS pandemic has increased the number of orphans worldwide and has exacerbated the poor living conditions of the world's poorest and most vulnerable children. AIDS has created an unprecedented orphan crisis, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where children have been hardest hit. An estimated 14,000,000 orphans have lost 1 or both parents to AIDS. By 2010, it is estimated that over 25,000,000 children will have been orphaned by AIDS.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Approximately 2,500,000 children under the age of 15 worldwide have HIV/AIDS. Every day another 2,000 children under the age of 15 are infected with HIV. Without treatment, most children born with HIV can expect to die by age two, but with sustained drug treatment through childhood, the chances of long-term survival and a productive adulthood improve dramatically.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Few international development programs specifically target the treatment of children with HIV/AIDS in developing countries. Reasons for this include the perceived low priority of pediatric treatment, a lack of pediatric health care professionals, lack of expertise and experience in pediatric drug dosing and monitoring, the perceived complexity of pediatric treatment, and mistaken beliefs regarding the risks and benefits of pediatric treatment.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Although a number of organizations seek to meet the needs of orphans or other vulnerable children, extended families and local communities continue to be the primary providers of support for such children.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The HIV/AIDS pandemic is placing huge burdens on communities and is leaving many orphans with little support. Alternatives to traditional orphanages, such as community-based resource centers, continue to evolve in response to the massive number of orphans that has resulted from the pandemic.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) The AIDS orphans crisis in sub-Saharan Africa has implications for political stability, human welfare, and development that extend far beyond the region, affecting governments and people worldwide, <!-- PDFPage:538 -->and this crisis requires an accelerated response from the international community.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Although section 403(b) of the United States Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Act of 2003 (22 U.S.C. 7673(b)) establishes the requirement that not less than 10 percent of amounts appropriated for HIV/AIDS assistance for each of fiscal years 2006 through 2008 shall be expended for assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children affected by HIV/AIDS, there is an urgent need to provide assistance to such children prior to 2006.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) Numerous United States and indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, provide assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. Many of these organizations have submitted applications for grants to the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development to provide increased levels of assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Increasing the amount of assistance that is provided by the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development through United States and indigenous private voluntary organizations, including faith-based organizations, will provide greater protection for orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) It is essential that the United States Government adopt a comprehensive approach for the provision of assistance to orphans and other vulnerable children in developing countries. A comprehensive approach would ensure that important services, such as basic care, psychosocial support, school food programs, increased educational opportunities and employment training and related services, the protection and promotion of inheritance rights for such children, and the treatment of orphans and other vulnerable children with HIV/AIDS, are made more accessible.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) Assistance for orphans and other vulnerable children can best be provided by a comprehensive approach of the United States Government that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) ensures that Federal agencies and the private sector coordinate efforts to prevent and eliminate duplication of efforts and waste in the provision of such assistance; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to the maximum extent possible, focuses on community-based programs that allow orphans and other vulnerable children to remain connected to the traditions and rituals of their families and communities.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of 2005&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Water-related diseases are a human tragedy, killing up to five million people annually, preventing millions of people from leading healthy lives, and undermining development efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) A child dies an average of every 15 seconds because of lack of access to safe water and adequate sanitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the poorest countries in the world, one out of five children dies from a preventable, water-related disease.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Lack of access to safe drinking water, inadequate sanitation, and poor hygiene practices are di<!-- PDFPage:540 -->rectly responsible for the vast majority of diarrheal diseases which kill over two million children each year.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) At any given time, half of all people in the developing world are suffering from one or more of the main diseases associated with inadequate provision of water supply and sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Over 1.1 billion people, one in every six people in the world, lack access to safe drinking water.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Nearly 2.6 billion people, two in every five people in the world, lack access to basic sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Half of all schools in the world do not have access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Over the past 20 years, two billion people have gained access to safe drinking water and 600 million people have gained access to basic sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) Access to safe water and sanitation and improved hygiene are significant factors in controlling the spread of disease in the developing world and positively affecting worker productivity and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) Increasing access to safe water and sanitation advances efforts toward other development objectives, such as fighting poverty and hunger, promoting primary education and gender equality, reducing child mortality, promoting environmental stability, improving the lives of slum dwellers, and strengthening national security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Providing safe supplies of water and sanitation and hygiene improvements would save millions of lives by reducing the prevalence of water-borne diseases, water-based diseases, water-privation diseases, and water-related vector diseases.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) Because women and girls in developing countries are often the carriers of water, lack of access to safe water and sanitation disproportionately affects women and limits women's opportunities at education, livelihood, and financial independence.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) Between 20 percent and 50 percent of existing water systems in developing countries are not operating or are operating poorly.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) In developing world water delivery systems, an average of 50 percent of all water is lost before it gets to the end-user.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Every $1 invested in safe water and sanitation would yield an economic return of between $3 and $34, depending on the region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Developing sustainable financing mechanisms, such as pooling mechanisms and revolving funds, is necessary for the long-term viability of improved water and sanitation services.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) The annual level of investment needed to meet the water and sanitation needs of developing countries far exceeds the amount of Official Development Assistance (ODA) and spending by governments of developing countries, so facilitating and attracting greater public and private investment is essential.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) Meeting the water and sanitation needs of the lowest-income developing countries will require an increase in the resources available as grants from donor countries.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) The long-term sustainability of improved water and sanitation services can be advanced by promoting community level action and engagement with civil society.</p>
