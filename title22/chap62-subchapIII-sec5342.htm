<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) United States companies can successfully compete in foreign markets if they are given fair access to such markets;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) in contrast to the barriers faced by United States firms in Japan, Japanese firms generally have enjoyed access to United States financial markets on the same terms as United States firms; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) United States firms seeking to compete in Japan face or have faced a variety of discriminatory barriers effectively precluding such firms from fairly competing for Japanese business, including&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) high fixed commission rates (ranging as high as 80 percent) which must be paid to members of the exchange by nonmembers for executing trades;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) unequal opportunities to participate in and act as lead manager for equity and bond underwritings;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) restrictions on access to automated teller machines;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) arbitrarily applied employment requirements for opening branch offices;</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Certain prior acquisitions excepted</h4>
