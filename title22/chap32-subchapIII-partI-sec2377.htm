<h4 class="note-head">Congressional Findings</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 324 of Pub. L. 104&ndash;132 provided that: &ldquo;The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the President should continue to make efforts to counter international terrorism a national security priority;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) because the United Nations has been an inadequate forum for the discussion of cooperative, multilateral responses to the threat of international terrorism, the President should undertake immediate efforts to develop effective multilateral responses to international terrorism as a complement to national counter terrorist efforts;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the President should use all necessary means, including covert action and military force, to disrupt, dismantle, and destroy international infrastructure used by international terrorists, including overseas terrorist training facilities and safe havens;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the President should continue to undertake efforts to increase the international isolation of state sponsors of international terrorism, including efforts to strengthen international sanctions, and should oppose any future initiatives to ease sanctions on Libya or other state sponsors of terrorism.&rdquo;</p>
