<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) of this section, the President shall impose the sanction described in subsection (c) of this section if the President determines in writing that, on or after the effective date of this subchapter, a foreign person or a United States person has materially and with requisite knowledge contributed, through the export from the United States or any other country of any goods or technology (as defined in section 6305(2) of this title), to the efforts by any individual, group, or non-nuclear-weapon state to acquire unsafeguarded special nuclear material or to use, develop, produce, stockpile, or otherwise acquire any nuclear explosive device.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">For purposes of this subsection, the term &ldquo;requisite knowledge&rdquo; means situations in which a person &ldquo;knows&rdquo;, as &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; is defined in section 78dd&ndash;2 of title 15.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President makes a determination described in subsection (a)(1) of this section with respect to a foreign person, the Congress urges the President to initiate consultations immediately with the government with primary jurisdiction over that foreign person with respect to the imposition of the sanction pursuant to this section.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Actions by government of jurisdiction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In order to pursue such consultations with that government, the President may delay imposition of the sanction pursuant to this section for up to 90 days. Following these consultations, the President shall impose the sanction unless the President determines and certifies in writing to the Congress that that government has taken specific and effective actions, including appropriate penalties, to terminate the involvement of the foreign person in the activities described in subsection (a)(1) of this section. The President may delay the imposition of the sanction for up to an additional 90 days if the President determines and certifies in writing to the Congress that that government is in the process of taking the actions described in the preceding sentence.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Not later than 90 days after making a determination under subsection (a)(1) of this section, the President shall submit to the Committee on Foreign Relations and the Committee on Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives a report on the status of consultations with the appropriate government under this subsection, and the basis for any determination under paragraph (2) of this subsection that such government has taken specific corrective actions.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) if the President determines in writing that the person or other entity to which the sanction would otherwise be applied is a sole source supplier of the defense articles or services, that the defense articles or services are essential, and that alternative sources are not readily or reasonably available; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) if the President determines in writing that such articles or services are essential to the national security under defense coproduction agreements;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Advisory opinions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Upon the request of any person, the Secretary of State may, in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, issue in writing an advisory opinion to that person as to whether a proposed activity by that person would subject that person to the sanction under this section. Any person who relies in good faith on such an advisory opinion which states that the proposed activity would not subject a person to such sanction, and any person who thereafter engages in such activity, may not be made subject to such sanction on account of such activity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Termination of sanction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The sanction imposed pursuant to this section shall apply for a period of at least 12 months following the imposition of the sanction and shall cease to apply thereafter only if the President determines and certifies in writing to the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) reliable information indicates that the foreign person or United States person with respect to which the determination was made under subsection (a)(1) of this section has <!-- PDFPage:1380 -->ceased to aid or abet any individual, group, or non-nuclear-weapon state in its efforts to acquire unsafeguarded special nuclear material or any nuclear explosive device, as described in that subsection; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">The President may waive the application of the sanction imposed on any person pursuant to this section, after the end of the 12-month period beginning on the date on which that sanction was imposed on that person, if the President determines and certifies in writing to the Congress that the continued imposition of the sanction would have a serious adverse effect on vital United States interests.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Notification of and report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">If the President decides to exercise the waiver authority provided in paragraph (1), the President shall so notify the Congress not less than 20 days before the waiver takes effect. Such notification shall include a report fully articulating the rationale and circumstances which led the President to exercise the waiver authority.</p>
