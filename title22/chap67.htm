<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;199, title I, &sect;&sect;101&ndash;103, Dec. 17, 1993, 107 Stat. 2318, 2319, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 101. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The purpose of this Act [see Short Title of 1993 Amendment note above] is to amend or repeal numerous statutory provisions that restrict or otherwise impede normal relations between the United States and the Russian Federation, Ukraine, and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union. All of the statutory provisions amended or repealed by this Act were relevant and appropriate at the time of enactment, but with the end of the Cold War, they have become obsolete. It is not the purpose of this Act to rewrite or erase history, or to forget those who suffered in the past from the injustices or repression of communist regimes in the Soviet Union, but rather to update United States law to reflect changed international circumstances and to demonstrate for reformers and democrats in the independent states of the former Soviet Union the resolve of the people of the United States to support the process of democratic and economic reform and to conduct business with those states in a new spirit of friendship and cooperation.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 102. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress finds and declares as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The Vancouver Declaration issued by President Clinton and President Yeltsin in April 1993 marked a new milestone in the development of the spirit of cooperation and partnership between the United States and Russia. The Congress affirms its support for the principles contained in the Vancouver Declaration.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The Vancouver Declaration underscored that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) a dynamic and effective partnership between the United States and Russia is vital to the success of Russia's historic transformation;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) the rapid integration of Russia into the community of democratic nations and the world economy is important to the national interest of the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) cooperation between the United States and Russia is essential to the peaceful resolution of international conflicts and the promotion of democratic values, the protection of human rights, and the solution of global problems such as environmental pollution, terrorism, and narcotics trafficking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The Congress enacted the FREEDOM Support Act (Public Law 102&ndash;511) [see Short Title note above], as well as other legislation such as the Soviet Nuclear Threat Reduction Act of 1991 (title II of Public Law 102&ndash;228) [22 U.S.C. 2551 note] and the Former Soviet Union Demilitarization Act of 1992 (title XIV of Public Law 102&ndash;484) [22 U.S.C. 5901 et seq.], to help meet the historic opportunities and challenges presented by the transformation that has taken place, and is continuing to take place, in what once was the Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The process of reform in Russia, Ukraine, and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union is ongoing. The holding of a referendum in Russia on April 25, 1993, that was free and fair, and that reflected the support of the Russian people for the process of continued and strengthened democratic and economic reform, represents an important and encouraging hallmark in this ongoing process.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) There remain in force many United States laws that are relics of the Cold War, and repeals or revisions of these provisions can play an important role in efforts to foster and strengthen the bonds of trust and friendship, as well as mutually beneficial trade and economic relations, between the United States and Russia, the United States and Ukraine, and the United States and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 103. STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN APPLICABLE TO THE SOVIET UNION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>In General</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;There are numerous statutory provisions that were enacted in the context of United States relations with a country, the Soviet Union, that are fundamentally different from the relations that now exist between the United States and Russia, between the United States and Ukraine, and between the United States and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Extent of Such Provisions</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Many of the provisions referred to in subsection (a) imposed limitations specifically with respect to the Soviet Union, and its constituent republics, or utilized language that reflected the tension that existed between the United States and the Soviet Union at the time of their enactment. Other such provisions did not refer specifically to the Soviet Union, but nonetheless were directed (or may be construed as having been directed) against the Soviet Union on the basis of the relations that formerly existed between the United States and the Soviet Union, particularly in its role as the leading communist country.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Findings and Affirmation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress finds and affirms that provisions such as those described in this section, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) section 216 of the State Department Basic Authorities Act of 1956 (22 U.S.C. 4316),</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) sections 136 [22 U.S.C. 3943 note] and 804 [99 Stat. 449] of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1986 and 1987 (Public Law 99&ndash;93),</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) section 1222 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1988 and 1989 (Public Law 100&ndash;204; 101 Stat. 1411 [1414]),</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Multilateral Export Control Enhancement Amendments Act [see Short Title of 1988 Amendment note set out under section 2410 of Title 50, App., War and National Defense] (50 [App.] U.S.C. 2410 note, et seq.),</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the joint resolution providing for the designation of &lsquo;Captive Nations Week&rsquo; (Public Law 86&ndash;90) [73 Stat. 212],</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the Communist Control Act of 1954 (Public Law 83&ndash;637) [see Short Title note set out under section 781 of Title 50],</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) provisions in the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.), including sections 101(a)(40), 101(e)(3), and 313(a)(3) [8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(40), (e)(3), 1424(a)(3)],</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) section 2 of the joint resolution entitled &lsquo;A joint resolution to promote peace and stability in the Middle East&rsquo;, approved March 9, 1957 (Public Law 85&ndash;7) [22 U.S.C. 1961 et seq.], and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) section 43 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act (22 U.S.C. 286aa),</p>
<p class="note-body-block">should not be construed as being directed against Russia, Ukraine, or the other independent states of the former Soviet Union, connoting an adversarial relationship between the United States and the independent states, or signifying or implying in any manner unfriendliness toward the independent states.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) recent developments in Russia and the other independent states of the former Soviet Union present an historic opportunity for a transition to a peaceful and stable international order and the integration of the independent states of the former Soviet Union into the community of democratic nations;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1396 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the entire international community has a vital interest in the success of this transition, and the dimension of the problems now faced in the independent states of the former Soviet Union makes it imperative for donor countries and institutions to provide the expertise and support necessary to ensure continued progress on economic and political reforms;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the United States is especially well-positioned because of its heritage and traditions to make a substantial contribution to this transition by building on current technical cooperation, medical, and food assistance programs, by assisting in the development of democratic institutions, and by fostering conditions that will encourage the United States business community to engage in trade and investment;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) failure to meet the opportunities presented by these developments could threaten United States national security interests and jeopardize substantial savings in United States defense that these developments have made possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) the independent states of the former Soviet Union face unprecedented environmental problems that jeopardize the quality of life and the very existence of not only their own peoples but also the peoples of other countries, and it is incumbent on the international community to assist the independent states in addressing these problems and in promoting sustainable use of resources and development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) the success of United States assistance for the independent states of the former Soviet Union depends on&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) effective coordination of United States efforts with similar activities of friendly and allied donor countries and of international financial institutions, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reciprocal commitments by the governments of the independent states to work toward the creation of democratic institutions and an environment hospitable to foreign investment based upon the rule of law, including negotiation of bilateral and multilateral agreements on open trade and investment, adoption of commercial codes, establishment of transparency in regulatory and other governmental decision making, and timely payment of obligations carried over from previous governmental entities; and</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) trade and investment opportunities in the independent states of the former Soviet Union will generate employment and other economic benefits for the United States as the economies of the independent states of the former Soviet Union begin to realize their enormous potential as both customers and suppliers.</p>
