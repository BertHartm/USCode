<p class="statutory-body">Congress declares that the relationship between the United States and Pakistan should be based on the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Pakistan is a critical friend and ally to the United States, both in times of strife and in times of peace, and the two countries share many common goals, including combating terrorism and violent radicalism, solidifying democracy and rule of law in Pakistan, and promoting the social and economic development of Pakistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) United States assistance to Pakistan is intended to supplement, not supplant, Pakistan's own efforts in building a stable, secure, and prosperous Pakistan.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The United States requires a balanced, integrated, countrywide strategy for Pakistan that provides assistance throughout the country and does not disproportionately focus on security-related assistance or one particular area or province.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The United States supports Pakistan's struggle against extremist elements and recognizes the profound sacrifice made by Pakistan in the fight against terrorism, including the loss of more than 1,900 soldiers and police since 2001 in combat with al Qaeda, the Taliban, and other extremist and terrorist groups.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) The United States intends to work with the Government of Pakistan&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) to build mutual trust and confidence by actively and consistently pursuing a sus<!-- PDFPage:1681 -->tained, long-term, multifaceted relationship between the two countries, devoted to strengthening the mutual security, stability, and prosperity of both countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) to support the people of Pakistan and their democratic government in their efforts to consolidate democracy, including strengthening Pakistan's parliament, helping Pakistan reestablish an independent and transparent judicial system, and working to extend the rule of law in all areas in Pakistan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) to promote sustainable long-term development and infrastructure projects, including in healthcare, education, water management, and energy programs, in all areas of Pakistan, that are sustained and supported by each successive democratic government in Pakistan;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) to ensure that all the people of Pakistan, including those living in areas governed by the Frontier Crimes Regulation, have access to public, modernized education and vocational training to enable them to provide for themselves, for their families, and for a more prosperous future for their children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) to support the strengthening of core curricula and the quality of schools across Pakistan, including madrassas, in order to improve the prospects for Pakistani children's futures and eliminate incitements to violence and intolerance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) to encourage and promote public-private partnerships in Pakistan in order to bolster ongoing development efforts and strengthen economic prospects, especially with respect to opportunities to build civic responsibility and professional skills of the people of Pakistan, including support for institutions of higher learning with international accreditation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) to expand people-to-people engagement between the two countries, through increased educational, technical, and cultural exchanges and other methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) to encourage the development of local analytical capacity to measure program effectiveness and progress on an integrated basis, especially across the areas of United States assistance and payments to Pakistan, and increase accountability for how such assistance and payments are being spent;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) to assist Pakistan's efforts to improve counterterrorism financing and anti-money laundering regulatory structure in order to achieve international standards and encourage Pakistan to apply for &ldquo;Financial Action Task Force&rdquo; observer status and adhere to the United Nations International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(J) to strengthen Pakistan's counterinsurgency and counterterrorism strategy to help prevent any territory of Pakistan from being used as a base or conduit for terrorist attacks in Pakistan or elsewhere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(K) to strengthen Pakistan's efforts to develop strong and effective law enforcement and national defense forces under civilian leadership;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(L) to achieve full cooperation in matters of counter-proliferation of nuclear materials and related networks;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(M) to strengthen Pakistan's efforts to gain control of its under-governed areas and address the threat posed by any person or group that conducts violence, sabotage, or other terrorist activities in Pakistan or its neighboring countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(N) to explore means to consult with and utilize the relevant expertise and skills of the Pakistani-American community.</p>
