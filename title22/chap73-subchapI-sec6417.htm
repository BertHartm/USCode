<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To encourage involvement with religious freedom concerns at every possible opportunity and by all appropriate representatives of the United States Government, it is the sense of the Congress that officials of the executive branch of Government should promote increased advocacy on such issues during meetings between foreign dignitaries and executive branch officials or Members of Congress.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Prisoner lists and issue briefs on religious freedom concerns</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State, in consultation with the Ambassador at Large, the Assistant Secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor, United States chiefs of mission abroad, regional experts, and nongovernmental human rights and religious groups, shall prepare and maintain issue briefs on religious freedom, on a country-by-country basis, consisting of lists of persons believed to be imprisoned, detained, or placed under house arrest for their religious faith, together with brief evaluations and critiques of the policies of the respective country restricting religious freedom. In considering the inclusion of names of prisoners on such lists, the Secretary of State shall exercise appropriate discretion, including concerns regarding the safety, security, and benefit to such prisoners.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Availability of information</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall, as appropriate, provide religious freedom issue briefs under subsection (b) of this section to executive branch officials and Members of Congress in anticipation of bilateral contacts with foreign leaders, both in the United States and abroad.</p>
