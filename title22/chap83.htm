<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7601. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) During the last 20 years, HIV/AIDS has assumed pandemic proportions, spreading from the most severely affected regions, sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, to all corners of the world, and leaving an unprecedented path of death and devastation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 65,000,000 individuals worldwide have been infected with HIV since the epidemic began, more than 25,000,000 of these individuals have lost their lives to the disease, and more than 14,000,000 children have been orphaned by the disease. HIV/AIDS is the fourth-highest cause of death in the world.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) At the end of 2002, an estimated 42,000,000 individuals were infected with HIV or living with AIDS, of which more than 75 percent live in Africa or the Caribbean. Of these individuals, more than 3,200,000 were children under the age of 15 and more than 19,200,000 were women.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Women are four times more vulnerable to infection than are men and are becoming infected at increasingly high rates, in part because many societies do not provide poor women and young girls with the social, legal, and cultural protections against high risk activities that expose them to HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Women and children who are refugees or are internally displaced persons are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation and violence, thereby increasing the possibility of HIV infection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) As the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS has killed more than 19,400,000 individuals (more than 3 times the <!-- PDFPage:1615 -->number of AIDS deaths in the rest of the world) and will claim the lives of one-quarter of the population, mostly adults, in the next decade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) An estimated 2,000,000 individuals in Latin America and the Caribbean and another 7,100,000 individuals in Asia and the Pacific region are infected with HIV or living with AIDS. Infection rates are rising alarmingly in Eastern Europe (especially in the Russian Federation), Central Asia, and China.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) HIV/AIDS threatens personal security by affecting the health, lifespan, and productive capacity of the individual and the social cohesion and economic well-being of the family.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) HIV/AIDS undermines the economic security of a country and individual businesses in that country by weakening the productivity and longevity of the labor force across a broad array of economic sectors and by reducing the potential for economic growth over the long term.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) HIV/AIDS destabilizes communities by striking at the most mobile and educated members of society, many of whom are responsible for security at the local level and governance at the national and subnational levels as well as many teachers, health care personnel, and other community workers vital to community development and the effort to combat HIV/AIDS. In some countries the overwhelming challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are accelerating the outward migration of critically important health care professionals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) HIV/AIDS weakens the defenses of countries severely affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis through high infection rates among members of their military forces and voluntary peacekeeping personnel. According to UNAIDS, in sub-Saharan Africa, many military forces have infection rates as much as five times that of the civilian population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) HIV/AIDS poses a serious security issue for the international community by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increasing the potential for political instability and economic devastation, particularly in those countries and regions most severely affected by the disease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) decreasing the capacity to resolve conflicts through the introduction of peacekeeping forces because the environments into which these forces are introduced pose a high risk for the spread of HIV/AIDS; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increasing the vulnerability of local populations to HIV/AIDS in conflict zones from peacekeeping troops with HIV infection rates significantly higher than civilian populations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The devastation wrought by the HIV/AIDS pandemic is compounded by the prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria, particularly in developing countries where the poorest and most vulnerable members of society, including women, children, and those individuals living with HIV/AIDS, become infected. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria accounted for more than 5,700,000 deaths in 2001 and caused debilitating illnesses in millions more.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Together, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and related diseases are undermining agricultural production throughout Africa. According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, 7,000,000 agricultural workers throughout 25 African countries have died from AIDS since 1985. Countries with poorly developed agricultural systems, which already face chronic food shortages, are the hardest hit, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where high HIV prevalence rates are compounding the risk of starvation for an estimated 14,400,000 people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Tuberculosis is the cause of death for one out of every three people with AIDS worldwide and is a highly communicable disease. HIV infection is the leading threat to tuberculosis control. Because HIV infection so severely weakens the immune system, individuals with HIV and latent tuberculosis infection have a 100 times greater risk of developing active tuberculosis diseases thereby increasing the risk of spreading tuberculosis to others. Tuberculosis, in turn, accelerates the onset of AIDS in individuals infected with HIV.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Malaria, the most deadly of all tropical parasitic diseases, has been undergoing a dramatic resurgence in recent years due to increasing resistance of the malaria parasite to inexpensive and effective drugs. At the same time, increasing resistance of mosquitoes to standard insecticides makes control of transmission difficult to achieve. The World Health Organization estimates that between 300,000,000 and 500,000,000 new cases of malaria occur each year, and annual deaths from the disease number between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000. Persons infected with HIV are particularly vulnerable to the malaria parasite. The spread of HIV infection contributes to the difficulties of controlling resurgence of the drug resistant malaria parasite.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) HIV/AIDS is first and foremost a health problem. Successful strategies to stem the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic will require clinical medical interventions, the strengthening of health care delivery systems and infrastructure, and determined national leadership and increased budgetary allocations for the health sector in countries affected by the epidemic as well as measures to address the social and behavioral causes of the problem and its impact on families, communities, and societal sectors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) Basic interventions to prevent new HIV infections and to bring care and treatment to people living with AIDS, such as voluntary counseling and testing and mother-to-child transmission programs, are achieving meaningful results and are cost-effective. The challenge is to expand these interventions from a pilot program basis to a national basis in a coherent and sustainable manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Appropriate treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS can prolong the lives of such individuals, preserve their families, prevent children from becoming orphans, and increase productivity of such individuals by allowing them to lead active lives and reduce the need for costly hospitalization for treatment of opportunistic infections caused by HIV.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) Nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based organizations, with experience <!-- PDFPage:1616 -->in health care and HIV/AIDS counseling, have proven effective in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic and can be a resource in assisting indigenous organizations in severely affected countries in their efforts to provide treatment and care for individuals infected with HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) Faith-based organizations are making an important contribution to HIV prevention and AIDS treatment programs around the world. Successful HIV prevention programs in Uganda, Jamaica, and elsewhere have included local churches and faith-based groups in efforts to promote behavior changes to prevent HIV, to reduce stigma associated with HIV infection, to treat those afflicted with the disease, and to care for orphans. The Catholic Church alone currently cares for one in four people being treated for AIDS worldwide. Faith-based organizations possess infrastructure, experience, and knowledge that will be needed to carry out these programs in the future and should be an integral part of United States efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20)(A) Uganda has experienced the most significant decline in HIV rates of any country in Africa, including a decrease among pregnant women from 20.6 percent in 1991 to 7.9 percent in 2000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Uganda made this remarkable turnaround because President Yoweri Museveni spoke out early, breaking long-standing cultural taboos, and changed widespread perceptions about the disease. His leadership stands as a model for ways political leaders in Africa and other developing countries can mobilize their nations, including civic organizations, professional associations, religious institutions, business and labor to combat HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Uganda's successful AIDS treatment and prevention program is referred to as the ABC model: &ldquo;Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms&rdquo;, in order of priority. Jamaica, Zambia, Ethiopia and Senegal have also successfully used the ABC model. Beginning in 1986, Uganda brought about a fundamental change in sexual behavior by developing a low-cost program with the message: &ldquo;Stop having multiple partners. Be faithful. Teenagers, wait until you are married before you begin sex.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) By 1995, 95 percent of Ugandans were reporting either one or zero sexual partners in the past year, and the proportion of sexually active youth declined significantly from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. The greatest percentage decline in HIV infections and the greatest degree of behavioral change occurred in those 15 to 19 years old. Uganda's success shows that behavior change, through the use of the ABC model, is a very successful way to prevent the spread of HIV.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) The magnitude and scope of the HIV/AIDS crisis demands a comprehensive, long-term, international response focused upon addressing the causes, reducing the spread, and ameliorating the consequences of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prevention and education, care and treatment, basic and applied research, and training of health care workers, particularly at the community and provincial levels, and other community workers and leaders needed to cope with the range of consequences of the HIV/AIDS crisis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) development of health care infrastructure and delivery systems through cooperative and coordinated public efforts and public and private partnerships;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) development and implementation of national and community-based multisector strategies that address the impact of HIV/AIDS on the individual, family, community, and nation and increase the participation of at-risk populations in programs designed to encourage behavioral and social change and reduce the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) coordination of efforts between international organizations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO), national governments, and private sector organizations, including faith-based organizations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(22) The United States has the capacity to lead and enhance the effectiveness of the international community's response by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) providing substantial financial resources, technical expertise, and training, particularly of health care personnel and community workers and leaders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promoting vaccine and microbicide research and the development of new treatment protocols in the public and commercial pharmaceutical research sectors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) making available pharmaceuticals and diagnostics for HIV/AIDS therapy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) encouraging governments and faith-based and community-based organizations to adopt policies that treat HIV/AIDS as a multisectoral public health problem affecting not only health but other areas such as agriculture, education, the economy, the family and society, and assisting them to develop and implement programs corresponding to these needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) promoting healthy lifestyles, including abstinence, delaying sexual debut, monogamy, marriage, faithfulness, use of condoms, and avoiding substance abuse; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) encouraging active involvement of the private sector, including businesses, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the medical and scientific communities, charitable foundations, private and voluntary organizations and nongovernmental organizations, faith-based organizations, community-based organizations, and other nonprofit entities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(23) Prostitution and other sexual victimization are degrading to women and children and it should be the policy of the United States to eradicate such practices. The sex industry, the trafficking of individuals into such industry, and sexual violence are additional causes of and factors in the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One in nine South Africans is living with AIDS, and sexual assault is rampant, at a victimization rate of one in three women. Meanwhile in Cambodia, as many as 40 percent <!-- PDFPage:1617 -->of prostitutes are infected with HIV and the country has the highest rate of increase of HIV infection in all of Southeast Asia. Victims of coercive sexual encounters do not get to make choices about their sexual activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(24) Strong coordination must exist among the various agencies of the United States to ensure effective and efficient use of financial and technical resources within the United States Government with respect to the provision of international HIV/AIDS assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(25) In his address to Congress on January 28, 2003, the President announced the Administration's intention to embark on a five-year emergency plan for AIDS relief, to confront HIV/AIDS with the goals of preventing 7,000,000 new HIV/AIDS infections, treating at least 2,000,000 people with life-extending drugs, and providing humane care for millions of people suffering from HIV/AIDS, and for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(26) In this address to Congress, the President stated the following: &ldquo;Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30,000,000 people have the AIDS virus&mdash;including 3,000,000 children under the age of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than 4,000,000 require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims&mdash;only 50,000&mdash;are receiving the medicine they need.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(27) Furthermore, the President focused on care and treatment of HIV/AIDS in his address to Congress, stating the following: &ldquo;Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, &lsquo;We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, you've got AIDS, we can't help you. Go home and die.&rsquo; In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(28) Finally, the President stated that &ldquo;[w]e have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country&rdquo;, proposing now that the United States should lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature, and asking Congress &ldquo;to commit $15,000,000,000 over the next five years, including nearly $10,000,000,000 in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(29) On May 27, 2003, the President signed this chapter into law, launching the largest international public health program of its kind ever created.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(30) Between 2003 and 2008, the United States, through the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and in conjunction with other bilateral programs and the multilateral Global Fund has helped to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) provide antiretroviral therapy for over 1,900,000 people;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) ensure that over 150,000 infants, most of whom would have likely been infected with HIV during pregnancy or childbirth, were not infected; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) provide palliative care and HIV prevention assistance to millions of other people.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(31) While United States leadership in the battles against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria has had an enormous impact, these diseases continue to take a terrible toll on the human race.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(32) According to the 2007 AIDS Epidemic Update of the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) an estimated 2,100,000 people died of AIDS-related causes in 2007; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) an estimated 2,500,000 people were newly infected with HIV during that year.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(33) According to the World Health Organization, malaria kills more than 1,000,000 people per year, 70 percent of whom are children under 5 years of age.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(34) According to the World Health Organization, 1/3 of the world's population is infected with the tuberculosis bacterium, and tuberculosis is 1 of the greatest infectious causes of death of adults worldwide, killing 1,600,000 people per year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(35) Efforts to promote abstinence, fidelity, the correct and consistent use of condoms, the delay of sexual debut, and the reduction of concurrent sexual partners represent important elements of strategies to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(36) According to UNAIDS&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) women and girls make up nearly 60 percent of persons in sub-Saharan Africa who are HIV positive;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) women and girls are more biologically, economically, and socially vulnerable to HIV infection; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) gender issues are critical components in the effort to prevent HIV/AIDS and to care for those affected by the disease.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(37) Children who have lost a parent to HIV/AIDS, who are otherwise directly affected by the disease, or who live in areas of high HIV prevalence may be vulnerable to the disease or its socioeconomic effects.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(38) Lack of health capacity, including insufficient personnel and inadequate infrastructure, in sub-Saharan Africa and other regions of the world is a critical barrier that limits the effectiveness of efforts to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, and to achieve other global health goals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(39) On March 30, 2007, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies released a report entitled &ldquo;PEPFAR Implementation: Progress and Promise&rdquo;, which found that budget allocations setting percentage levels for spending on prevention, care, and treatment and for certain subsets of activities within the prevention category&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) have &ldquo;adversely affected implementation of the U.S. Global AIDS Initiative&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) have inhibited comprehensive, integrated, evidence based approaches;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) &ldquo;have been counterproductive&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) &ldquo;may have been helpful initially in ensuring a balance of attention to activities within the 4 categories of prevention, treat<!-- PDFPage:1618 -->ment, care, and orphans and vulnerable children&rdquo;;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) &ldquo;have also limited PEPFAR's ability to tailor its activities in each country to the local epidemic and to coordinate with the level of activities in the countries&rsquo; national plans&rdquo;; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) should be removed by Congress and replaced with more appropriate mechanisms that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) &ldquo;ensure accountability for results from Country Teams to the U.S. Global AIDS Coordinator and to Congress&rdquo;; and</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(1) In furtherance of the purposes of section 2151b&ndash;2 of this title, and to assist in providing a safe, secure, reliable, and sustainable supply chain of pharmaceuticals and other products needed to provide care and treatment of persons with HIV/AIDS and related infections, the Coordinator of the United States Government Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally (the &ldquo;Coordinator&rdquo;) is authorized to establish an HIV/AIDS Working Capital Fund (in this section referred to as the &ldquo;HIV/AIDS Fund&rdquo;).</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds deposited during any fiscal year in the HIV/AIDS Fund shall be available without fiscal year limitation and used for pharmaceuticals and other products needed to provide care and treatment of persons with HIV/AIDS and related infections, including, but not limited to&mdash;</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Innovative partnerships between governments and organizations in the private sector (including foundations, universities, corporations, faith-based and community-based organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations) have proliferated in recent years, particularly in the area of health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Public-private sector partnerships multiply local and international capacities to strengthen the delivery of health services in developing countries and to accelerate research for vaccines and other pharmaceutical products that are essential to combat infectious diseases decimating the populations of these countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) These partnerships maximize the unique capabilities of each sector while combining financial and other resources, scientific knowledge, and expertise toward common goals which neither the public nor the private sector can achieve alone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Sustaining existing public-private partnerships and building new ones are critical to the success of the international community's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases around the globe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sustainment and promotion of public-private partnerships should be a priority element of the strategy pursued by the United States to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other global health crises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the United States should systematically track the evolution of these partnerships and work with others in the public and private sector to profile and build upon those models that are most effective.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings; sense of Congress</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (Public Law 106&ndash;264) [22 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Global Fund is an innovative financing mechanism which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) has made progress in many areas in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) represents the multilateral component of this chapter, extending United States efforts to more than 130 countries around the world.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Global Fund and United States bilateral assistance programs&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) are demonstrating increasingly effective coordination, with each possessing certain comparative advantages in the fight against HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) often work most effectively in concert with each other.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The United States Government&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) is the largest supporter of the Global Fund in terms of resources and technical support;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) made the founding contribution to the Global Fund; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) is fully committed to the success of the Global Fund as a multilateral public-private partnership.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) transparency and accountability are crucial to the long-term success and viability of the Global Fund;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) the Global Fund has made significant progress toward addressing concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) improving risk assessment and risk management capabilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) providing clearer guidance for and oversight of Local Fund Agents; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) strengthening the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) the provision of sufficient resources and authority to the Office of the Inspector General for the Global Fund to ensure that office has the staff and independence necessary to carry out its mandate will be a measure of the commitment of the Global Fund to transparency and accountability;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) regular, publicly published financial, programmatic, and reporting audits of the Fund, its grantees, and Local Fund Agents are also important benchmarks of transparency;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) the Global Fund should establish and maintain a system to track&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) the amount of funds disbursed to each subrecipient on the grant's fiscal cycle; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) the distribution of resources, by grant and principal recipient, for prevention, care, treatment, drug and commodity purchases, and other purposes;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) relevant national authorities in recipient countries should exempt from duties and taxes all products financed by Global Fund grants and procured by any principal recipient or subrecipient for the purpose of carrying out such grants;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1628 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) the Global Fund, UNAIDS, and the Global AIDS Coordinator should work together to standardize program indicators wherever possible;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(H) for purposes of evaluating total amounts of funds contributed to the Global Fund under subsection (d)(4)(A)(i), the timetable for evaluations of contributions from sources other than the United States should take into account the fiscal calendars of other major contributors; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) the Global Fund should not support activities involving the &ldquo;Affordable Medicines Facility-Malaria&rdquo; or similar entities pending compelling evidence of success from pilot programs as evaluated by the Coordinator of United States Government Activities to Combat Malaria Globally.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority for United States participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) United States participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States is hereby authorized to participate in the Global Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Privileges and immunities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The Global Fund shall be considered a public international organization for purposes of section 288 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Statement of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States Government regards the imposition by recipient countries of taxes or tariffs on goods or services provided by the Global Fund, which are supported through public and private donations, including the substantial contribution of the American people, as inappropriate and inconsistent with standards of good governance. The Global AIDS Coordinator or other representatives of the United States Government shall work with the Global Fund to dissuade governments from imposing such duties, tariffs, or taxes.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reports to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than 1 year after May 27, 2003, and annually thereafter for the duration of the Global Fund, the President shall submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the Global Fund, including contributions pledged to, contributions (including donations from the private sector) received by, and projects funded by the Global Fund, and the mechanisms established for transparency and accountability in the grant-making process.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) United States financial participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to any other funds authorized to be appropriated for bilateral or multilateral HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, or malaria programs, of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 7671 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President up to $2,000,000,000 for fiscal year 2009,,<sup><a href="#7622_1_target" name="7622_1">1</a></sup> and such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2010 through 2013, for contributions to the Global Fund.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(4) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A)(i) At any time during fiscal years 2009 through 2013, no United States contribution to the Global Fund may cause the total amount of United States Government contributions to the Global Fund to exceed 33 percent of the total amount of funds contributed to the Global Fund from all sources. Contributions to the Global Fund from the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the International Monetary Fund shall not be considered in determining compliance with this paragraph.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) If, at any time during any of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013, the President determines that the Global Fund has provided assistance to a country, the government of which the Secretary of State has determined, for purposes of section 2405(j)(1) of title 50, Appendix, has repeatedly provided support for acts of international terrorism, then the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal to the amount expended by the Fund to the government of each such country. The President may waive the application of this clause with respect to assistance for Sudan that is overseen by the Southern Country Coordinating Mechanism, including Southern Sudan, Southern Kordofan, Blue Nile State, and Abyei, if the President determines that the national interest or humanitarian reasons justify such a waiver. The President shall publish each waiver of this clause in the Federal Register and, not later than 15 days before the waiver takes effect, shall consult with the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives regarding the proposed waiver.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) If at any time the President determines that the expenses of the Governing, Administrative, and Advisory Bodies (including the Partnership Forum, the Foundation Board, the Secretariat, and the Technical Review Board) of the Global Fund exceed 10 percent of the total expenditures of the Fund for any 2-year period, the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal the to the average annual amount expended by the Fund for such 2-year period for the expenses of the Governing, Administrative, and Advisory Bodies in excess of 10 percent of the total expenditures of the Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) The President may waive the application of clause (iii) if the President determines that extraordinary circumstances warrant such a waiver. No waiver under this clause may be for any period that exceeds 1 year.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1629 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(v) If, at any time during any of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008, the President determines that the salary of any individual employed by the Global Fund exceeds the salary of the Vice President of the United States (as determined under section 104 of title 3) for that fiscal year, then the United States shall withhold from its contribution for the next fiscal year an amount equal to the aggregate amount by which the salary of each such individual exceeds the salary of the Vice President of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(vi) For the purposes of clause (i), &ldquo;funds contributed to the Global Fund from all sources&rdquo; means funds contributed to the Global Fund at any time during fiscal years 2009 through 2013 that are not contributed to fulfill a commitment made for a fiscal year before fiscal year 2009.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B)(i) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) shall be contributed to the Global Fund as soon as practicable, subject to subparagraph (A)(i), after additional contributions to the Global Fund are made from other sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be transferred to the Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally Fund and shall remain available under the same terms and conditions as funds appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 7671 of this title for HIV/AIDS assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of clause (ii) or (iii) of subparagraph (A) is authorized to be made available to carry out section 2151b&ndash;2 of this title. Amounts made available under the preceding sentence are in addition to amounts appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 7671 of this title for HIV/AIDS assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iv) Notwithstanding clause (i), after July 31 of each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013, any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(i) is authorized to be made available to carry out sections 2151b&ndash;2, 2151b&ndash;3, and 2151b&ndash;4 of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) The President may suspend the application of subparagraph (A) with respect to a fiscal year if the President determines that an international health emergency threatens the national security interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The President shall notify the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate not less than 5 days before making a determination under clause (i) with respect to the application of subparagraph (A)(i) and shall include in the notification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a justification as to why increased United States Government contributions to the Global Fund is preferable to increased United States assistance to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria on a bilateral basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) an explanation as to why other government donors to the Global Fund are unable to provide adequate contributions to the Fund.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(5) Withholding funds</h4>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">As indicated in the report produced by the Institute of Medicine, entitled &ldquo;PEPFAR Implementation: Progress and Promise&rdquo;, inadequate caloric intake has been clearly identified as a principal reason for failure of clinical response to antiretroviral therapy.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 7671 of this title, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2009 through 2013 to carry out this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility for assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An organization, including a faith-based organization, that is otherwise eligible to receive assistance under section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 [22 U.S.C. 2151b&ndash;2], under this chapter, or under any amendment made by this chapter or by the Tom Lantos and Henry J. Hyde United States Global Leadership Against HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria Reauthorization Act of 2008, for HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment, or care&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds made available to carry out this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, except that this subsection shall not apply to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative or to any United Nations agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sense of Congress relating to food assistance for individuals living with HIV/AIDS</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The United States provides more than 60 percent of all food assistance worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) According to the United Nations World Food Program and other United Nations agencies, food insecurity of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS is a major problem in countries with large populations of such individuals, particularly in African countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Although the United States is willing to provide food assistance to these countries in need, a few of the countries object to part or all of the assistance because of fears of benign genetic modifications to the foods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Healthy and nutritious foods for individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS are an important complement to HIV/AIDS medicines for such individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Individuals infected with HIV have higher nutritional requirements than individuals who are not infected with HIV, particularly with respect to the need for protein. Also, there is evidence to suggest that the full benefit of therapy to treat HIV/AIDS may not be achieved in individuals who are malnourished, particularly in pregnant and lactating women.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7651. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Approximately 2,000 children around the world are infected each day with HIV through mother-to-child transmission. Transmission can occur during pregnancy, labor, and delivery or through breast feeding. Over 90 percent of these cases are in developing nations with little or no access to public health facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Mother-to-child transmission is largely preventable with the proper application of pharmaceuticals, therapies, and other public health interventions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Certain antiretroviral drugs reduce mother-to-child transmission by nearly 50 percent. Universal availability of this drug could prevent up to 400,000 infections per year and dramatically reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) At the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June 2001, the United States committed to the specific goals with respect to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, including the goals of reducing the proportion of infants infected with HIV by 20 percent by the year 2005 and by 50 percent by the year 2010, as specified in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the Special Session.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Several United States Government agencies including the United States Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control are already supporting programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission in resource-poor nations and have the capacity to expand these programs rapidly by working closely with foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission can provide the basis for a broader response that includes care and treatment of mothers, fathers, and other family members who are infected with HIV or living with AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) HIV/AIDS has devastated the lives of countless children and families across the globe. Since the epidemic began, an estimated 13,200,000 children under the age of 15 have been orphaned by AIDS, that is they have lost their mother or both parents to the disease. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that this number will double by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) HIV/AIDS also targets young people between the ages of 15 to 24, particularly young women, many of whom carry the burden of caring for family members living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 10,300,000 young people are now living with HIV/AIDS. One-half of all new infections are occurring among this age group.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States Government's response to the global HIV/AIDS pandemic should place high priority on the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, the care and treatment of family members and caregivers, and the care of children orphaned by AIDS. To the maximum extent possible, the United States Government should seek to leverage its funds by seeking matching contributions from the private sector, other national governments, and international organizations.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The President, acting through the United States Agency for International Development, should establish a program of assistance that would demonstrate the feasibility of the provision of care and treatment to orphans and other children and young people affected by HIV/AIDS in foreign countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The program should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) build upon and be integrated into programs administered as of May 27, 2003, by the relevant executive branch agencies for children affected by HIV/AIDS;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) work in conjunction with indigenous community-based programs and activities, particularly those that offer proven services for children;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) reduce the stigma of HIV/AIDS to encourage vulnerable children infected with HIV or living with AIDS and their family members and caregivers to avail themselves of voluntary counseling and testing, and related programs, including treatments;</p>
