<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7601. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) During the last 20 years, HIV/AIDS has assumed pandemic proportions, spreading from the most severely affected regions, sub-Saharan Africa and the Caribbean, to all corners of the world, and leaving an unprecedented path of death and devastation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) According to the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), more than 65,000,000 individuals worldwide have been infected with HIV since the epidemic began, more than 25,000,000 of these individuals have lost their lives to the disease, and more than 14,000,000 children have been orphaned by the disease. HIV/AIDS is the fourth-highest cause of death in the world.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3)(A) At the end of 2002, an estimated 42,000,000 individuals were infected with HIV or living with AIDS, of which more than 75 percent live in Africa or the Caribbean. Of these individuals, more than 3,200,000 were children under the age of 15 and more than 19,200,000 were women.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:1580 --><p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Women are four times more vulnerable to infection than are men and are becoming infected at increasingly high rates, in part because many societies do not provide poor women and young girls with the social, legal, and cultural protections against high risk activities that expose them to HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Women and children who are refugees or are internally displaced persons are especially vulnerable to sexual exploitation and violence, thereby increasing the possibility of HIV infection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) As the leading cause of death in sub-Saharan Africa, AIDS has killed more than 19,400,000 individuals (more than 3 times the number of AIDS deaths in the rest of the world) and will claim the lives of one-quarter of the population, mostly adults, in the next decade.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) An estimated 2,000,000 individuals in Latin America and the Caribbean and another 7,100,000 individuals in Asia and the Pacific region are infected with HIV or living with AIDS. Infection rates are rising alarmingly in Eastern Europe (especially in the Russian Federation), Central Asia, and China.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) HIV/AIDS threatens personal security by affecting the health, lifespan, and productive capacity of the individual and the social cohesion and economic well-being of the family.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) HIV/AIDS undermines the economic security of a country and individual businesses in that country by weakening the productivity and longevity of the labor force across a broad array of economic sectors and by reducing the potential for economic growth over the long term.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) HIV/AIDS destabilizes communities by striking at the most mobile and educated members of society, many of whom are responsible for security at the local level and governance at the national and subnational levels as well as many teachers, health care personnel, and other community workers vital to community development and the effort to combat HIV/AIDS. In some countries the overwhelming challenges of the HIV/AIDS epidemic are accelerating the outward migration of critically important health care professionals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) HIV/AIDS weakens the defenses of countries severely affected by the HIV/AIDS crisis through high infection rates among members of their military forces and voluntary peacekeeping personnel. According to UNAIDS, in sub-Saharan Africa, many military forces have infection rates as much as five times that of the civilian population.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) HIV/AIDS poses a serious security issue for the international community by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increasing the potential for political instability and economic devastation, particularly in those countries and regions most severely affected by the disease;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) decreasing the capacity to resolve conflicts through the introduction of peacekeeping forces because the environments into which these forces are introduced pose a high risk for the spread of HIV/AIDS; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) increasing the vulnerability of local populations to HIV/AIDS in conflict zones from peacekeeping troops with HIV infection rates significantly higher than civilian populations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) The devastation wrought by the HIV/AIDS pandemic is compounded by the prevalence of tuberculosis and malaria, particularly in developing countries where the poorest and most vulnerable members of society, including women, children, and those individuals living with HIV/AIDS, become infected. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria accounted for more than 5,700,000 deaths in 2001 and caused debilitating illnesses in millions more.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Together, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and related diseases are undermining agricultural production throughout Africa. According to the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization, 7,000,000 agricultural workers throughout 25 African countries have died from AIDS since 1985. Countries with poorly developed agricultural systems, which already face chronic food shortages, are the hardest hit, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa, where high HIV prevalence rates are compounding the risk of starvation for an estimated 14,400,000 people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Tuberculosis is the cause of death for one out of every three people with AIDS worldwide and is a highly communicable disease. HIV infection is the leading threat to tuberculosis control. Because HIV infection so severely weakens the immune system, individuals with HIV and latent tuberculosis infection have a 100 times greater risk of developing active tuberculosis diseases thereby increasing the risk of spreading tuberculosis to others. Tuberculosis, in turn, accelerates the onset of AIDS in individuals infected with HIV.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Malaria, the most deadly of all tropical parasitic diseases, has been undergoing a dramatic resurgence in recent years due to increasing resistance of the malaria parasite to inexpensive and effective drugs. At the same time, increasing resistance of mosquitoes to standard insecticides makes control of transmission difficult to achieve. The World Health Organization estimates that between 300,000,000 and 500,000,000 new cases of malaria occur each year, and annual deaths from the disease number between 2,000,000 and 3,000,000. Persons infected with HIV are particularly vulnerable to the malaria parasite. The spread of HIV infection contributes to the difficulties of controlling resurgence of the drug resistant malaria parasite.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) HIV/AIDS is first and foremost a health problem. Successful strategies to stem the spread of the HIV/AIDS pandemic will require clinical medical interventions, the strengthening of health care delivery systems and infrastructure, and determined national leadership and increased budgetary allocations for the health sector in countries affected by the epidemic as well as measures to address the social and behavioral causes of the problem and its impact on families, communities, and societal sectors.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) Basic interventions to prevent new HIV infections and to bring care and treatment to people living with AIDS, such as voluntary <!-- PDFPage:1581 -->counseling and testing and mother-to-child transmission programs, are achieving meaningful results and are cost-effective. The challenge is to expand these interventions from a pilot program basis to a national basis in a coherent and sustainable manner.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(17) Appropriate treatment of individuals with HIV/AIDS can prolong the lives of such individuals, preserve their families, prevent children from becoming orphans, and increase productivity of such individuals by allowing them to lead active lives and reduce the need for costly hospitalization for treatment of opportunistic infections caused by HIV.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(18) Nongovernmental organizations, including faith-based organizations, with experience in health care and HIV/AIDS counseling, have proven effective in combating the HIV/AIDS pandemic and can be a resource in assisting indigenous organizations in severely affected countries in their efforts to provide treatment and care for individuals infected with HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(19) Faith-based organizations are making an important contribution to HIV prevention and AIDS treatment programs around the world. Successful HIV prevention programs in Uganda, Jamaica, and elsewhere have included local churches and faith-based groups in efforts to promote behavior changes to prevent HIV, to reduce stigma associated with HIV infection, to treat those afflicted with the disease, and to care for orphans. The Catholic Church alone currently cares for one in four people being treated for AIDS worldwide. Faith-based organizations possess infrastructure, experience, and knowledge that will be needed to carry out these programs in the future and should be an integral part of United States efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(20)(A) Uganda has experienced the most significant decline in HIV rates of any country in Africa, including a decrease among pregnant women from 20.6 percent in 1991 to 7.9 percent in 2000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Uganda made this remarkable turnaround because President Yoweri Museveni spoke out early, breaking long-standing cultural taboos, and changed widespread perceptions about the disease. His leadership stands as a model for ways political leaders in Africa and other developing countries can mobilize their nations, including civic organizations, professional associations, religious institutions, business and labor to combat HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) Uganda's successful AIDS treatment and prevention program is referred to as the ABC model: &ldquo;Abstain, Be faithful, use Condoms&rdquo;, in order of priority. Jamaica, Zambia, Ethiopia and Senegal have also successfully used the ABC model. Beginning in 1986, Uganda brought about a fundamental change in sexual behavior by developing a low-cost program with the message: &ldquo;Stop having multiple partners. Be faithful. Teenagers, wait until you are married before you begin sex.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) By 1995, 95 percent of Ugandans were reporting either one or zero sexual partners in the past year, and the proportion of sexually active youth declined significantly from the late 1980s to the mid-1990s. The greatest percentage decline in HIV infections and the greatest degree of behavioral change occurred in those 15 to 19 years old. Uganda's success shows that behavior change, through the use of the ABC model, is a very successful way to prevent the spread of HIV.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(21) The magnitude and scope of the HIV/AIDS crisis demands a comprehensive, long-term, international response focused upon addressing the causes, reducing the spread, and ameliorating the consequences of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) prevention and education, care and treatment, basic and applied research, and training of health care workers, particularly at the community and provincial levels, and other community workers and leaders needed to cope with the range of consequences of the HIV/AIDS crisis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) development of health care infrastructure and delivery systems through cooperative and coordinated public efforts and public and private partnerships;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) development and implementation of national and community-based multisector strategies that address the impact of HIV/AIDS on the individual, family, community, and nation and increase the participation of at-risk populations in programs designed to encourage behavioral and social change and reduce the stigma associated with HIV/AIDS; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) coordination of efforts between international organizations such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), the World Health Organization (WHO), national governments, and private sector organizations, including faith-based organizations.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(22) The United States has the capacity to lead and enhance the effectiveness of the international community's response by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) providing substantial financial resources, technical expertise, and training, particularly of health care personnel and community workers and leaders;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) promoting vaccine and microbicide research and the development of new treatment protocols in the public and commercial pharmaceutical research sectors;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) making available pharmaceuticals and diagnostics for HIV/AIDS therapy;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) encouraging governments and faith-based and community-based organizations to adopt policies that treat HIV/AIDS as a multisectoral public health problem affecting not only health but other areas such as agriculture, education, the economy, the family and society, and assisting them to develop and implement programs corresponding to these needs;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) promoting healthy lifestyles, including abstinence, delaying sexual debut, monogamy, marriage, faithfulness, use of condoms, and avoiding substance abuse; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) encouraging active involvement of the private sector, including businesses, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, the medical and scientific communities, charitable foundations, private and vol<!-- PDFPage:1582 -->untary organizations and nongovernmental organizations, faith-based organizations, community-based organizations, and other nonprofit entities.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(23) Prostitution and other sexual victimization are degrading to women and children and it should be the policy of the United States to eradicate such practices. The sex industry, the trafficking of individuals into such industry, and sexual violence are additional causes of and factors in the spread of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. One in nine South Africans is living with AIDS, and sexual assault is rampant, at a victimization rate of one in three women. Meanwhile in Cambodia, as many as 40 percent of prostitutes are infected with HIV and the country has the highest rate of increase of HIV infection in all of Southeast Asia. Victims of coercive sexual encounters do not get to make choices about their sexual activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(24) Strong coordination must exist among the various agencies of the United States to ensure effective and efficient use of financial and technical resources within the United States Government with respect to the provision of international HIV/AIDS assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(25) In his address to Congress on January 28, 2003, the President announced the Administration's intention to embark on a five-year emergency plan for AIDS relief, to confront HIV/AIDS with the goals of preventing 7,000,000 new HIV/AIDS infections, treating at least 2,000,000 people with life-extending drugs, and providing humane care for millions of people suffering from HIV/AIDS, and for children orphaned by HIV/AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(26) In this address to Congress, the President stated the following: &ldquo;Today, on the continent of Africa, nearly 30,000,000 people have the AIDS virus&mdash;including 3,000,000 children under the age of 15. There are whole countries in Africa where more than one-third of the adult population carries the infection. More than 4,000,000 require immediate drug treatment. Yet across that continent, only 50,000 AIDS victims&mdash;only 50,000&mdash;are receiving the medicine they need.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(27) Furthermore, the President focused on care and treatment of HIV/AIDS in his address to Congress, stating the following: &ldquo;Because the AIDS diagnosis is considered a death sentence, many do not seek treatment. Almost all who do are turned away. A doctor in rural South Africa describes his frustration. He says, &lsquo;We have no medicines. Many hospitals tell people, you've got AIDS, we can't help you. Go home and die.&rsquo; In an age of miraculous medicines, no person should have to hear those words. AIDS can be prevented. Anti-retroviral drugs can extend life for many years *&nbsp;*&nbsp;* Ladies and gentlemen, seldom has history offered a greater opportunity to do so much for so many.&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(28) Finally, the President stated that &ldquo;[w]e have confronted, and will continue to confront, HIV/AIDS in our own country&rdquo;, proposing now that the United States should lead the world in sparing innocent people from a plague of nature, and asking Congress &ldquo;to commit $15,000,000,000 over the next five years, including nearly $10,000,000,000 in new money, to turn the tide against AIDS in the most afflicted nations of Africa and the Caribbean&rdquo;.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Innovative partnerships between governments and organizations in the private sector (including foundations, universities, corporations, faith-based and community-based organizations, and other nongovernmental organizations) have proliferated in recent years, particularly in the area of health.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Public-private sector partnerships multiply local and international capacities to strengthen the delivery of health services in developing countries and to accelerate research for vaccines and other pharmaceutical products that are essential to combat infectious diseases decimating the populations of these countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) These partnerships maximize the unique capabilities of each sector while combining financial and other resources, scientific knowledge, and expertise toward common goals which neither the public nor the private sector can achieve alone.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Sustaining existing public-private partnerships and building new ones are critical to the success of the international community's efforts to combat HIV/AIDS and other infectious diseases around the globe.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the sustainment and promotion of public-private partnerships should be a priority element of the strategy pursued by the United States to combat the HIV/AIDS pandemic and other global health crises; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the United States should systematically track the evolution of these partnerships and work with others in the public and private sector to profile and build upon those models that are most effective.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7622. Participation in the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The establishment of the Global Fund in January 2002 is consistent with the general principles for an international AIDS trust fund first outlined by the Congress in the Global AIDS and Tuberculosis Relief Act of 2000 (Public Law 106&ndash;264) [22 U.S.C. 6801 et seq.].</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Section 2, Article 5 of the bylaws of the Global Fund provides for the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development to serve as the initial collection trustee for the Global Fund.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The trustee agreement signed between the Global Fund and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development narrows the range of duties to include receiving and investing funds from donors, disbursing the funds upon the instruction of the Global Fund, reporting on trust fund resources to donors and the Global Fund, and providing an annual external audit report to the Global Fund.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authority for United States participation</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) United States participation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The United States is hereby authorized to participate in the Global Fund.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Any amount made available under this subsection that is withheld by reason of subparagraph (A)(iii) shall be transferred to the Activities to Combat HIV/AIDS Globally Fund and shall remain available under the same terms and conditions as funds appropriated pursuant to the authorization of appropriations under section 7671 of this title for HIV/AIDS assistance.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C)(i) The President may suspend the application of subparagraph (A) with respect to a fiscal year if the President determines that an international health emergency threatens the national security interests of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) The President shall notify the Committee on International Relations of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate not less than 5 days before making a determination under <!-- PDFPage:1588 -->clause (i) with respect to the application of subparagraph (A)(i) and shall include in the notification&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(I) a justification as to why increased United States Government contributions to the Global Fund is preferable to increased United States assistance to combat HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria on a bilateral basis; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(II) an explanation as to why other government donors to the Global Fund are unable to provide adequate contributions to the Fund.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Omitted</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">In addition to funds available under section 104(c) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. 2151b(c)) for such purpose or under any other provision of that Act [22 U.S.C. 2151 et seq.], there are authorized to be appropriated to the President, from amounts authorized to be appropriated under section 7671 of this title, such sums as may be necessary for each of the fiscal years 2004 through 2008 to carry out section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as added by subsection (a) [22 U.S.C. 2151b&ndash;2].</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Availability of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Amounts appropriated pursuant to paragraph (1) are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(3) Allocation of funds</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Of the amount authorized to be appropriated by paragraph (1) for the fiscal years 2004 through 2008, such sums as may be necessary are authorized to be appropriated to carry out section 104A(d)(4) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by subsection (a)) [22 U.S.C. 2151b&ndash;2(d)(4)], relating to the procurement and distribution of HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Relationship to assistance programs to enhance nutrition</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In recognition of the fact that malnutrition may hasten the progression of HIV to AIDS and may exacerbate the decline among AIDS patients leading to a shorter life span, the Administrator of the United States Agency for International Development shall, as appropriate&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) integrate nutrition programs with HIV/AIDS activities, generally;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide, as a component of an anti-retroviral therapy program, support for food and nutrition to individuals infected with and affected by HIV/AIDS; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) provide support for food and nutrition for children affected by HIV/AIDS and to communities and households caring for children affected by HIV/AIDS.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Eligibility for assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">An organization that is otherwise eligible to receive assistance under section 104A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (as added by subsection (a)) [22 U.S.C. 2151b&ndash;2] or under any other provision of this chapter (or any amendment made by this chapter) to prevent, treat, or monitor HIV/AIDS shall not be required, as a condition of receiving the assistance, to endorse or utilize a multisectoral approach to combatting HIV/AIDS, or to endorse, utilize, or participate in a prevention method or treatment program to which the organization has a religious or moral objection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds made available to carry out this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, may be used to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution or sex trafficking. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall be construed to preclude the provision to individuals of palliative care, treatment, or post-exposure pharmaceutical prophylaxis, and necessary pharmaceuticals and commodities, including test kits, condoms, and, when proven effective, microbicides.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Limitation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No funds made available to carry out this chapter, or any amendment made by this chapter, may be used to provide assistance to any group or organization that does not have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and sex trafficking, except that this subsection shall not apply to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, the World Health Organization, the International AIDS Vaccine Initiative or to any United Nations agency.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Sense of Congress relating to food assistance for individuals living with HIV/AIDS</h4>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(1) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) The United States provides more than 60 percent of all food assistance worldwide.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) According to the United Nations World Food Program and other United Nations agencies, food insecurity of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS is a major problem in countries with large populations of such individuals, particularly in African countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) Although the United States is willing to provide food assistance to these countries in need, a few of the countries object to part or all of the assistance because of fears of benign genetic modifications to the foods.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) Healthy and nutritious foods for individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS are an important complement to HIV/AIDS medicines for such individuals.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) Individuals infected with HIV have higher nutritional requirements than individuals who are not infected with HIV, particularly with respect to the need for protein. Also, there is evidence to suggest that the full benefit of therapy to treat HIV/AIDS may not be achieved in individuals who are malnourished, particularly in pregnant and lactating women.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Sense of Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">It is therefore the sense of Congress that United States food assistance should be accepted by countries with large populations of individuals infected or living with HIV/AIDS, particularly African countries, in order to help feed such individuals.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;7651. Findings</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Approximately 2,000 children around the world are infected each day with HIV through mother-to-child transmission. Transmission can occur during pregnancy, labor, and delivery or through breast feeding. Over 90 percent of these cases are in developing nations with little or no access to public health facilities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Mother-to-child transmission is largely preventable with the proper application of pharmaceuticals, therapies, and other public health interventions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Certain antiretroviral drugs reduce mother-to-child transmission by nearly 50 percent. Universal availability of this drug could prevent up to 400,000 infections per year and dramatically reduce the number of AIDS-related deaths.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) At the United Nations Special Session on HIV/AIDS in June 2001, the United States committed to the specific goals with respect to the prevention of mother-to-child transmission, including the goals of reducing the proportion of infants infected with HIV by 20 percent by the year 2005 and by 50 percent by the year 2010, as specified in the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS adopted by the United Nations General Assembly at the Special Session.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Several United States Government agencies including the United States Agency for International Development and the Centers for Disease Control are already supporting programs to prevent mother-to-child transmission in resource-poor nations and have the capacity to expand these programs rapidly by working closely with foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) Efforts to prevent mother-to-child transmission can provide the basis for a broader response that includes care and treatment of mothers, fathers, and other family members who are infected with HIV or living with AIDS.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) HIV/AIDS has devastated the lives of countless children and families across the globe. Since the epidemic began, an estimated 13,200,000 children under the age of 15 have been orphaned by AIDS, that is they have lost their mother or both parents to the disease. The Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) estimates that this number will double by the year 2010.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) HIV/AIDS also targets young people between the ages of 15 to 24, particularly young women, many of whom carry the burden of caring for family members living with HIV/AIDS. An estimated 10,300,000 young people are now living with HIV/AIDS. One-half of all new infections are occurring among this age group.</p>
