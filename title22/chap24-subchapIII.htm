<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic should not be the last emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe invited to join NATO;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States should ensure that NATO continues a process whereby all other emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that wish to join NATO will be considered for membership in NATO as soon as they meet the criteria for such membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States should ensure that no limitations are placed on the numbers of NATO troops or types of equipment, including tactical nuclear weapons, to be deployed on the territory of new member states;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the United States should reject all efforts to condition NATO decisions on review or approval by the United Nations Security Council;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the United States should clearly delineate those NATO deliberations, including but not limited to discussions on arms control, further Alliance enlargement, procurement matters, and strategic doctrine, that are not subject to review or discussion in the NATO-Russia Permanent Joint Council;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the United States should work to ensure that countries invited to join the Alliance are provided an immediate seat in NATO discussions; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the United States already pays more than a proportionate share of the costs of the common defense of Europe and should obtain, in advance, agreement on an equitable distribution of the cost of NATO enlargement to ensure that the United States does not continue to bear a disproportionate burden.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>Policy With Respect to Negotiations With Russia.&mdash;</cap-smallcap></p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>Implementation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;NATO enlargement should be carried out in such a manner as to underscore the Alliance's defensive nature and demonstrate to Russia that NATO enlargement will enhance the security of all countries in Europe, including Russia. Accordingly, the United States and its NATO allies should make this intention clear in negotiations with Russia, including negotiations regarding adaptation of the Conventional Armed Forces in Europe (CFE) Treaty of November 19, 1990.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Limitations on commitments to russia</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In seeking to demonstrate to Russia NATO's defensive and security-enhancing intentions, it is essential that neither fundamental United States security interests in Europe nor the effectiveness and flexibility of NATO as a defensive alliance be jeopardized. In particular, no commitments should be made to Russia that would have the effect of&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) extending rights or imposing responsibilities on new NATO members different from those applicable to current NATO members, including rights or responsibilities with respect to the deployment of nuclear weapons and the stationing of troops and equipment from other NATO members;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) limiting the ability of NATO to defend the territory of new NATO members by, for example, restricting the construction of defense infrastructure or limiting the ability of NATO to deploy necessary reinforcements;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) providing any international organization, or any country that is not a member of NATO, with authority to delay, veto, or otherwise impede deliberations and decisions of the North Atlantic Council or the implementation of such decisions, including deliberations and decisions with respect to the deployment of NATO forces or the admission of additional members to NATO;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) impeding the development of enhanced relations between NATO and other European countries that do not belong to the Alliance;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(E) establishing a nuclear weapons-free zone in Central or Eastern Europe;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(F) requiring NATO to subsidize Russian arms sales, service, or support to the militaries of those former Warsaw Pact countries invited to join the Alliance; or</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(G) legitimizing Russian efforts to link concessions in arms control negotiations to NATO enlargement.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) <cap-smallcap>Commitments from russia</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;In order to enhance security and stability in Europe, the United States should seek commitments from Russia&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) to demarcate and respect all its borders with neighboring states;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) to achieve the immediate and complete withdrawal of any armed forces and military equipment under the control of Russia that are deployed on the territories of the independent states of the former Soviet Union without the full and complete agreement of those states;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) to station its armed forces on the territory of other states only with the full and complete agreement of that state and in strict accordance with international law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(D) to take steps to reduce further its nuclear and conventional forces in Kaliningrad.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) <cap-smallcap>Consultations</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As negotiations on adaptation of the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe proceed, the United States should engage in close and continuous consultations not only with its NATO allies, but also with the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe, Ukraine, and the South Caucasus.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(c) <cap-smallcap>Policy With Respect to Ballistic Missile Defense Cooperation</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) <cap-smallcap>In general</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;As the United States proceeds with efforts to develop defenses against ballistic missile attack, it should seek to foster a climate of co<!-- PDFPage:367 -->operation with Russia on matters related to missile defense.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) <cap-smallcap>Discussions with nato allies</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The United States should initiate discussions with its NATO allies for the purpose of examining the feasibility of deploying a ballistic missile defense capable of protecting NATO's southern and eastern flanks from a limited ballistic missile attack.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">NATO Enlargement Facilitation</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 104&ndash;208, div. A, title I, &sect;101(c) [title VI], Sept. 30, 1996, 110 Stat. 3009&ndash;121, 3009&ndash;173, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 601. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This title may be cited as the &lsquo;NATO Enlargement Facilitation Act of 1996&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 602. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Since 1949, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has played an essential role in guaranteeing the security, freedom, and prosperity of the United States and its partners in the Alliance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) The NATO Alliance is, and has been since its inception, purely defensive in character, and it poses no threat to any nation. The enlargement of the NATO Alliance to include as full and equal members emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe will serve to reinforce stability and security in Europe by fostering their integration into the structures which have created and sustained peace in Europe since 1945. Their admission into NATO will not threaten any nation. America's security, freedom, and prosperity remain linked to the security of the countries of Europe.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) The sustained commitment of the member countries of NATO to a mutual defense has made pos<!-- PDFPage:369 -->sible the democratic transformation of Central and Eastern Europe. Members of the Alliance can and should play a critical role in addressing the security challenges of the post-Cold War era and in creating the stable environment needed for those emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe to successfully complete political and economic transformation.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The United States continues to regard the political independence and territorial integrity of all emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe as vital to European peace and security.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The active involvement by the countries of Central and Eastern Europe has made the Partnership for Peace program an important forum to foster cooperation between NATO and those countries seeking NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) NATO has enlarged its membership on 3 different occasions since 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Congress supports the admission of qualified new members to NATO and the European Union at an early date and has sought to facilitate the admission of qualified new members into NATO.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Lasting security and stability in Europe requires not only the military integration of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe into existing European structures, but also the eventual economic and political integration of these countries into existing European structures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) As new members of NATO assume the responsibilities of Alliance membership, the costs of maintaining stability in Europe should be shared more widely. Facilitation of the enlargement process will require current members of NATO, and the United States in particular, to demonstrate the political will needed to build on successful ongoing programs such as the Warsaw Initiative and the Partnership for Peace by making available the resources necessary to supplement efforts prospective new members are themselves undertaking.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) New members will be full members of the Alliance, enjoying all rights and assuming all the obligations under the North Atlantic Treaty, signed at Washington on April 4, 1949 (hereafter in this Act referred to as the &lsquo;Washington Treaty&rsquo;).</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) In order to assist emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO to be prepared to assume the responsibilities of NATO membership, the United States should encourage and support efforts by such countries to develop force structures and force modernization priorities that will enable such countries to contribute to the full range of NATO missions, including, most importantly, territorial defense of the Alliance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) Cooperative regional peacekeeping initiatives involving emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe that have expressed interest in joining NATO, such as the Baltic Peacekeeping Battalion, the Polish-Lithuanian Joint Peacekeeping Force, and the Polish-Ukrainian Peacekeeping Force, can make an important contribution to European peace and security and international peacekeeping efforts, can assist those countries preparing to assume the responsibilities of possible NATO membership, and accordingly should receive appropriate support from the United States.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) NATO remains the only multilateral security organization capable of conducting effective military operations and preserving security and stability of the Euro-Atlantic region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(14) NATO is an important diplomatic forum and has played a positive role in defusing tensions between members of the Alliance and, as a result, no military action has occurred between two Alliance member states since the inception of NATO in 1949.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(15) The admission to NATO of emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe which are found to be in a position to further the principles of the Washington Treaty would contribute to international peace and enhance the security of the region. Countries which have become democracies and established market economies, which practice good neighborly relations, and which have established effective democratic civilian control over their defense establishments and attained a degree of interoperability with NATO, should be evaluated for their potential to further the principles of the Washington Treaty.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(16) Democratic civilian control of defense forces is an essential element in the process of preparation for those states interested in possible NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(17) Protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights is an integral aspect of genuine security, and in evaluating requests for membership in NATO, the human rights records of the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be evaluated according to their commitments to fulfill in good faith the human rights obligations of the Charter of the United Nations, the principles of the Universal Declaration on Human Rights, and the Helsinki Final Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(18) A number of Central and Eastern European countries have expressed interest in NATO membership, and have taken concrete steps to demonstrate this commitment, including their participation in Partnership for Peace activities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(19) The Caucasus region remains important geographically and politically to the future security of Central Europe. As NATO proceeds with the process of enlargement, the United States and NATO should continue to examine means to strengthen the sovereignty and enhance the security of United Nations recognized countries in that region.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(20) In recognition that not all countries which have requested membership in NATO will necessarily qualify at the same pace, the accession date for each new member will vary.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(21) The provision of additional NATO transition assistance should include those emerging democracies most ready for closer ties with NATO and should be designed to assist other countries meeting specified criteria of eligibility to move forward toward eventual NATO membership.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(22) The Congress of the United States finds in particular that Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic have made significant progress toward achieving the criteria set forth in section 203(d)(3) of the NATO Participation Act of 1994 [Pub. L. 103&ndash;447, set out in a note below] and should be eligible for the additional assistance described in this Act.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(23) The evaluation of future membership in NATO for emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should be based on the progress of those nations in meeting criteria for NATO membership, which require enhancement of NATO's security and the approval of all NATO members.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(24) The process of NATO enlargement entails the consensus agreement of the governments of all 16 NATO members and ratification in accordance with their constitutional procedures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(25) Some NATO members, such as Spain and Norway, do not allow the deployment of nuclear weapons on their territory although they are accorded the full collective security guarantees provided by Article 5 of the Washington Treaty. There is no a priori requirement for the stationing of nuclear weapons on the territory of new NATO members, particularly in the current security climate. However, NATO retains the right to alter its security posture at any time as circumstances warrant.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 603. UNITED STATES POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the policy of the United States&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) to join with the NATO allies of the United States to adapt the role of the NATO Alliance in the post-Cold War world;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) to actively assist the emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe in their transition so that such countries may eventually qualify for NATO membership;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:370 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) to support the enlargement of NATO in recognition that enlargement will benefit the interests of the United States and the Alliance and to consider these benefits in any analysis of the costs of NATO enlargement;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) to ensure that all countries in Central and Eastern Europe are fully aware of and capable of assuming the costs and responsibilities of NATO membership, including the obligation set forth in Article 10 of the Washington Treaty that new members be able to contribute to the security of the North Atlantic area; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) to work to define a constructive and cooperative political and security relationship between an enlarged NATO and the Russian Federation.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 604. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING FURTHER ENLARGEMENT OF NATO.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;It is the sense of the Congress that in order to promote economic stability and security in Slovakia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Romania, Bulgaria, Albania, Moldova, and Ukraine&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) the United States Government should use all diplomatic means available to press the European Union to admit as soon as possible any country which qualifies for membership;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) the United States Government and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization should continue and expand their support for military exercises and peacekeeping initiatives between and among these nations, nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and Russia; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the process of enlarging NATO to include emerging democracies in Central and Eastern Europe should not be limited to consideration of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and Slovenia as full members of the NATO Alliance.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 605. SENSE OF THE CONGRESS REGARDING ESTONIA, LATVIA AND LITHUANIA.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;In view of the forcible incorporation of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania into the Soviet Union in 1940 under the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the refusal of the United States and other countries to recognize that incorporation for over 50 years, it is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania have valid historical security concerns that must be taken into account by the United States; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania should not be disadvantaged in seeking to join NATO by virtue of their forcible incorporation into the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) The modernization of the theater nuclear capabilities of NATO is a continuing process and stems from the 1983 Montebello decision by NATO to reduce the stockpile of nuclear weapons in Europe while taking steps to ensure that the remaining nuclear weapons of the alliance are responsive, survivable, and effective.</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) in recognition of these and other threats, the United States has greatly increased its annual defense spending through sustained real growth averaging 8.8 percent yearly between fiscal 1981 and 1985, and cumulative real growth of 50 percent in that period;</p>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the United States Government applauds the policy of Japan to obtain the capabilities to defend its sea and air lanes out to 1,000 miles, expects that these capabilities should be acquired by the end of the decade, and recognizes that achieving those capabilities would significantly improve the national security of both Japan and the United States;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) the United States Government appreciates the contribution already made by Japan through the Host Nation Support Program and its recent efforts to increase its defense spending; and</p>

There is no existing program, however, under which United States civilians who are hired directly by these organizations can be screened and cleared for access to such Organization's TOP SECRET, SECRET, or CONFIDENTIAL information while so employed. It is, of course, in the interest of the United States that United States citizens who participate in the activities of NATO, SEATO, and CENTO as direct hire employees of the civil or military agencies of those organizations be reliable, trustworthy, of good conduct and character, and of complete and unswerving loyalty to the United States.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;1942. Development assistance in Latin America; Congressional declaration of policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">(a) It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the historic, economic, political, and geographic relationships among the American Republics are unique and of special significance and, as appropriate, should be so recognized in future legislation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) although governmental forms differ among the American Republics, the peoples of all the Americas are dedicated to the creation and maintenance of governments which will promote individual freedom;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the interests of the American Republics are so interrelated that sound social and economic progress in each is of importance to all and that lack of it in any American Republic may have serious repercussions in others;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) for the peoples of Latin America to continue to progress within the framework of our common heritage of democratic ideals, there is a compelling need for the achievement of social and economic advance adequate to meet the legitimate aspirations of the individual citizens of the countries of Latin America for a better way of life;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) there is a need for a plan of hemispheric development, open to all American Republics which cooperate in such plan, based upon a strong production effort, the expansion of foreign trade, the creation and maintenance of internal financial stability, the growth of free economic and social institutions, and the development of economic cooperation, including all possible steps to establish and maintain equitable rates of exchange and to bring about the progressive elimination of trade barriers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) mindful of the advantages which the United States has enjoyed through the existence of a large domestic market with no internal trade barriers, and believing that similar advantages can accrue to all countries, it is the hope of the people of the United States that all American Republics will jointly exert sustained common efforts which will speedily achieve that economic cooperation in the Western Hemisphere which is essential for lasting peace and prosperity; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) accordingly, it is declared to be the policy of the people of the United States to sustain and strengthen principles of individual liberty, free institutions, private enterprise, and genuine independence in the Western Hemisphere through cooperation with all American Republics which participate in a joint development program based upon self-help and mutual efforts.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(b) In order to carry forward the above policy, the Congress hereby&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) urges the President through our constitutional processes to develop cooperative programs on a bilateral or multilateral basis which will set forth specific plans of action designed to foster economic progress and improvements in the welfare and level of living of all the peoples of the American Republics on the basis of joint aid, mutual effort, and common sacrifice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) proposes the development of workable procedures to expand hemispheric trade and to moderate extreme price fluctuations in commodities which are of exceptional importance in the economies of the American Republics, and encourages the development of regional economic cooperation among the American Republics;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) supports the development of a more accurate and sympathetic understanding among the peoples of the American Republics through a greater interchange of persons, ideas, techniques, and educational, scientific, and cultural achievements;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) supports the strengthening of free democratic trade unions to raise standards of living through improved management-labor relations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) favors the progressive development of common standards with respect to the rights and the responsibilities of private investment which flows across national boundaries within the Western Hemisphere;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) supports the consolidation of the public institutions and agencies of inter-American cooperation, insofar as feasible, within the structure of the Organization of American States and the strengthening of the personnel resources and authority of the Organization in order that it may play a role of increasing importance in all aspects of hemispheric cooperation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) declares that it is prepared to give careful and sympathetic consideration to programs which the President may develop for the purpose of promoting these policies.</p>
