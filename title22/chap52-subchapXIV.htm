<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">It shall be the duty of a consular officer, or, if no consular officer is present, a diplomatic officer, under such procedural regulations as the Secretary of State may prescribe&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body">First. To take possession and to dispose of the personal estate left by any citizen of the United States, except a seaman who is a member of the crew of an American vessel, who shall die within or is domiciled at time of death within his jurisdiction: <em>Provided</em>, That such procedure is authorized by treaty provisions or permitted by the laws or authorities of the country wherein the death occurs, or the decedent is domiciled, or that such privilege is accorded by established usage: <em>Provided further</em>, That the decedent shall leave in the country where the death occurred or where he was domiciled, no legal representative, partner in trade, or trustee by him appointed to take care of his personal estate. A consular officer or, in his absence, a diplomatic officer shall act as the provisional conservator of the personal property within his jurisdiction of a deceased citizen of the United States but, unless authorized by treaty provisions, local law, or usage, he shall not act as administrator of such personal property. He shall render assistance in guarding, collecting, and transmitting the property to the United States to be disposed of according to the law of the decedent's domicile.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Second. After having taken possession of the personal property, as provisional conservator, to inventory and carefully appraise the effects with the assistance of two competent persons who, together with such officer, shall sign the inventory and annex thereto an appropriate certificate as to the accuracy of the appraised value of each article.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Third. To collect the debts due to the decedent in his jurisdiction and pay from the estate the obligations owed there by the decedent.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Fourth. To sell at auction, after reasonable public notice, unless the amount involved does not justify such expenditure, such part of the estate as shall be of a perishable nature, and after reasonable public notice and notice to next of kin if they can be ascertained by reasonable diligence such further part, if any, as shall be necessary for the payment of the decedent's debts incurred in such country, and funeral expenses, and expenses incident to the disposition of the estate. If, at the expiration of one year from the date of death (or for such additional period as may be required for final settlement of the estate), no claimant shall appear, the residue of the estate, with the exception of investments of bonds, shares of stocks, notes of indebtedness, jewelry or heirlooms, or other articles having a sentimental value, shall be sold.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Fifth. To transmit to the Department of State the proceeds of the sale (and any unsold effects, such as investments of bonds, shares of stocks, notes of indebtedness, jewelry or heirlooms, or other articles having a sentimental value), there to be held in trust for the legal claimant. If, however, at any time prior to such transmission, the decedent's legal representative should appear and demand the proceeds and effects in the officer's hands, he shall deliver them to such representative after having collected the prescribed fee therefor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary of State or the Secretary's representative shall act as conservator of such parts of these estates as may be received by the Department of State or are in its possession, and may, when deemed to be in the interest of the estate, sell such effects, including bonds, shares of stock, notes of indebtedness, jewelry, or other articles, which have heretofore or may hereafter be so received, and pay the expenses of such sale out of the proceeds: <em>Provided</em>, That application <!-- PDFPage:1134 -->for such effects shall not have been made by the legal claimant within six years after their receipt. The Secretary of State is authorized, for and in behalf of the estate of the deceased, to receive any balances due to such estates, to draw therefor on banks, safe deposits, trust or loan companies, or other like institutions, to endorse all checks, bills of exchange, promissory notes, and other evidences of indebtedness due to such estates, and take such other action as may be deemed necessary for the conservation of such estates. The net proceeds of such sales, together with such other moneys as may be collected by him, shall be deposited into the Treasury to a fund in trust for the legal claimant and reported to the Secretary of State.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">If no claim to the effects the proceeds of which have been so deposited shall have been received from a legal claimant of the deceased within six years from the date of the receipt of the effects by the Department of State, the funds so deposited, with any remaining unsold effects, less transmittal charges, shall be transmitted by that department to the proper officer of the State or Territory of the last domicile in the United States of the deceased citizen, if known, or, if not, such funds shall be covered into the general fund of the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts on account of proceeds of deceased citizens, and any such remaining unsold effects shall be disposed of by the Department of State in such manner as, in the judgment of the Secretary of State, is deemed appropriate, or they may be destroyed if considered no longer possessed of any value: <em>Provided</em>, That when the estate shall be valued in excess of $500, and no claim therefor has been presented to the Department of State by a legal claimant within the period specified in this paragraph or the legal claimant is unknown, before disposition of the estate as provided herein, notice shall be given by publishing once a week for four consecutive weeks in a newspaper published in the county of the last known domicile of the deceased, in the United States, the expense thereof to be deducted from the proceeds of such estate, and any lawful claim received as the result of such advertisement shall be adjusted and settled as provided for herein.</p>

If such citizen has named, by any lawful testamentary disposition, any other person than a consular officer or diplomatic officer to take charge of and manage such property, it shall be the duty of the officer, whenever required by the person so named, to give his official aid in whatever way may be practicable to facilitate the proceedings of such person in the lawful execution of his trust, and, so far as the laws of the country or treaty provisions permit, to protect the property of the deceased from any interference by the authorities of the country where such citizen died. To this end it shall be the duty of the consular officer, or if no consular officer is present a diplomatic officer, to safeguard the decedent's property by placing thereon his official seal and to break and remove such seal only upon the request of the person designated by the deceased to take charge of and manage his property.</p>

At any post, port, or place where there is no consular officer, the Secretary of State may authorize any other officer or employee of the United States Government who is a United States citizen serving overseas, including any contract employee of the United States Government, to perform such acts, and any such contractor so authorized shall not be considered to be a consular officer. Every such oath, affirmation, affidavit, deposition, and notarial act administered, sworn, affirmed, taken, had, or done, by or before any such officer, when certified under his hand and seal of office, shall be as valid, and of like force and effect within the United States, to all intents and purposes, as if administered, sworn, affirmed, taken, had, or done, by or before any other person within the United States duly authorized and competent thereto. If any person shall willfully and corruptly commit perjury, or by any means procure any person to commit perjury in any such oath, affirmation, affidavit, or deposition, within the intent and meaning of any Act of Congress now or hereafter made, such offender may be charged, proceeded against, tried, convicted, and dealt with in any district of the United States, in the same manner, in all respects, as if such offense had been committed in the United States, before any officer duly authorized therein to administer or take such oath, affirmation, affidavit, or deposition, and shall be subject to the same punishment and disability therefor as are or shall be prescribed by any such act for such offense; and any document purporting to have affixed, impressed, or subscribed thereto, or thereon the seal and signature of the officer administering or taking the same in testimony thereof, shall be admitted in evidence without proof of any such seal or signature being genuine or of the official character of such person; and if any person shall forge any such seal or signature, or shall tender in evidence any such document with a false or counterfeit seal or signature thereto, knowing the same to be false or counterfeit, he shall be deemed and taken to be guilty of a misdemeanor and on conviction shall be imprisoned not exceeding three years nor less than one year, and fined, in a sum not to exceed $3,000, and may be charged, proceeded against, tried, convicted, and dealt with therefor in the district where he may be arrested or in custody. Pursuant to such regulations as the Secretary of State may prescribe, the Secretary may designate any other employee of the Department of State who is a citizen of the United States to perform any notarial function authorized to be performed by a consular officer of the United States under this Act.</p>
