<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the extent of cooperation of such government in permitting an unimpeded investigation of alleged violations of internationally recognized human rights by appropriate international organizations, including the International Committee of the Red Cross, or <!-- PDFPage:445 -->groups or persons acting under the authority of the United Nations or of the Organization of American States; and</p>
