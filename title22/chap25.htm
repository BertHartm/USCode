<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Agreement to reimburse for actual costs, confiscation or spoilage of fish, and loss of income</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary, upon receipt of an application filed with him at any time after the effective date of this section by the owner of any vessel of the United States which is documented or certificated as a commercial fishing vessel, shall enter into an agreement with such owner subject to the provision of this section and such other terms and conditions as the Secretary deems appropriate. Such agreement shall provide that, if said vessel is seized by a foreign country and detained under the conditions of section 1972 of this title, the Secretary shall guarantee&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the owner of such vessel for all actual costs, except those covered by section 1973 of this title, incurred by the owner during the seizure and detention period and as a direct result thereof, as determined by the Secretary, resulting (A) from any damage to, or destruction of, such vessel, or its fishing gear or other equipment, (B) from the loss or confiscation of such vessel, gear, or equipment, or (C) from dockage fees or utilities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the owner of such vessel and its crew for the market value of fish caught before seizure of such vessel and confiscated or spoiled during the period of detention; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the owner of such vessel and its crew for not to exceed 50 per centum of the gross income lost as a direct result of such seizure and detention, as determined by the Secretary of State, based on the value of the average catch per day's fishing during the three most recent calendar years immediately preceding such seizure and detention of the vessel seized, or, if such experience is not available, then of all commercial fishing vessels of the United States engaged in the same fishery as that of the type and size of the seized vessel.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Distribution of payments according to commercial fishing practices and procedures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Payments made by the Secretary under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (a) of this section shall be distributed by the Secretary in accordance with the usual practices and procedures of the particular segment of the United States <!-- PDFPage:401 -->commercial fishing industry to which the seized vessel belongs relative to the sale of fish caught and the distribution of the proceeds of such sale.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Establishment of fees; amount of fees; credit of fees to separate Treasury account; payment from collected fees; authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Secretary shall from time to time establish by regulation fees which shall be paid by the owners of vessels entering into agreements under this section. Such fees shall be adequate (1) to recover the costs of administering this section, and (2) to cover a reasonable portion of any payments made by the Secretary under this section. All fees collected by the Secretary shall be credited to a separate account established in the Treasury of the United States which shall remain available without fiscal year limitation to carry out the provisions of this section. Those fees not currently needed for payments under this section shall be kept on deposit or invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States and all revenues accruing from such deposits or investments shall be credited to such separate account. If a transfer of funds is made to the separate account under section 1975(b)(2) of this title with respect to an unpaid claim and such claim is later paid, the amount so paid shall be covered into the Treasury as miscellaneous receipts. All payments under this section shall be made first out of such fees so long as they are available and thereafter out of funds which are hereby authorized to be appropriated to such account to carry out the provisions of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Finality of determinations; insured losses</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All determinations made under this section shall be final. No payment under this section shall be made with respect to any losses covered by any policy of insurance or other provision of law.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Effective date</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The provisions of this section shall be effective until October 1, 2008; except that payments may be made under this section only to such extent and in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Definitions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purposes of this section&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the term &ldquo;Secretary&rdquo; means the Secretary of State.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) The term &ldquo;fishing gear&rdquo; means any equipment or appurtenance which is necessary for the carrying out of fishing operations by a fishing vessel, whether or not such equipment or appurtenance is attached to such vessel.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) The term &ldquo;fund&rdquo; means the Fishing Vessel and Gear Damage Compensation Fund established under subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) The term &ldquo;resulting economic loss&rdquo; means the gross income, as estimated by the Secretary, that a fishing vessel owner or operator who is eligible for compensation under this section for damage to, loss of, or destruction of, a fishing vessel or the fishing gear used with such vessel will lose by reason of not being able to engage in fishing, or having to reduce his fishing effort, during the period before the vessel or gear, or both, are repaired or replaced and available for use.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Causes of loss or destruction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the provisions of this section, the owner or operator (hereinafter referred to as the &ldquo;vessel owner&rdquo;) of any fishing vessel which is a vessel of the United States is eligible for monetary compensation under this section for any damage to, loss of, or destruction of such vessel, or any fishing gear used with such vessel, or both, and for any resulting economic loss, if the damage, loss, or destruction&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Eligibility for compensation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A vessel owner is not eligible for compensation under this section with respect to fishing vessel or fishing gear damage, loss, or destruction and resulting economic loss unless such owner&mdash;</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The amount of compensation awarded to any vessel owner under this section shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) the depreciated replacement cost, or the repair cost, whichever cost is less, of the fishing vessel or the fishing gear concerned; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) 25 percent of any resulting economic loss.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Any amount determined pursuant to subparagraph (A) or (B) shall be reduced to the extent that evidence indicates that negligence by the vessel owner or operator contributed to the cause or the extent of the damage, loss, or destruction and shall be further reduced by the amount of compensation, if any, that the vessel owner or operator has received or will receive with respect to the damage, loss, destruction, or resulting economic loss through insurance, pursuant to any other provision of law, or otherwise.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The initial determination made by the Secretary under paragraph (1) with respect to any application shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) if the application is disapproved, set forth the reasons therefor; or</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(4) Any vessel owner who is aggrieved by any decision of the Secretary contained in the initial determination of the Secretary regarding such owner's application may, within thirty days after the date of issue of the initial determination, petition the Secretary for a review of the decision. If petition for review is not made to the Secretary within such thirty-day period regarding the initial determination, the initial determination shall be deemed to be the final determination on the application. Before undertaking any such review, the Secretary shall provide to the vessel owner opportunity to submit additional written or oral evidence relating to the decision. After review the Secretary shall issue a final determination with respect to the application.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5) If compensation is awarded under the final determination on any application, the Secretary shall promptly pay from the fund to such owner the amount of compensation stated in the final determination. Upon the acceptance of such payment by the vessel owner, the United States shall be subrogated to all rights of the vessel owner with respect to which the payment is made.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Surcharge on foreign fishing vessels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In addition to any fee imposed under section 204(b)(10) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1824(b)(10)) with respect to any foreign fishing vessel for any year after 1978, the Secretary shall impose a surcharge in an amount not to exceed 20 percent of the amount of the fee imposed under such section for such year. The failure to pay any surcharge imposed under this subsection with respect to any foreign fishing vessel shall be treated by the Secretary as a failure to pay the fee for such vessel under such section 204(b)(10).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Fishing Vessel and Gear Damage Compensation Fund; requirements, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There is established in the Treasury of the United States the Fishing Vessel and Gear Damage Compensation Fund.

<p class="statutory-body">(2) The fund shall consist of&mdash;</p>

Sums in the fund which are not currently needed for the purpose of paying such awards shall be kept on deposit or invested in obligations of, or guaranteed by, the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Whenever the amount in the fund is not sufficient to pay compensation under this section, the Secretary may issue, in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000, notes or other obligations to the Secretary of the Treasury, in such forms and denominations, bearing such maturities, and subject to such terms and conditions as the Sec<!-- PDFPage:406 -->retary of the Treasury may prescribe. Such notices&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1980_2_target" name="1980_2">2</a></sup> or other obligations shall bear interest at a rate to be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury on the basis of the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of such notices&nbsp;<sup><a href="#1980_2_target" name="1980_2">2</a></sup> or other obligations.

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) a copy of the receipt for payment;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Funding; appropriations</h4>

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) in 1994 Canada required all commercial fishing vessels of the United States to pay 1,500 Canadian dollars to obtain a &lsquo;license which authorizes transit&rsquo; through the Inside Passage;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) this action was inconsistent with international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, and, in particular, Article 26 of that Convention, which specifically prohibits such fees, and threatened the safety of United States commer<!-- PDFPage:408 -->cial fishermen who sought to avoid the fee by traveling in less protected waters;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 [22 U.S.C. 1971 et seq.] provides for the reimbursement of vessel owners who are forced to pay a license fee to secure the release of a vessel which has been seized, but does not permit reimbursement of a fee paid by the owner in advance in order to prevent a seizure;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) Canada required that the license fee be paid in person in 2 ports on the Pacific Coast of Canada, or in advance by mail;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) significant expense and delay was incurred by commercial fishing vessels of the United States that had to travel from the point of seizure back to one of those ports in order to pay the license fee required by Canada, and the costs of that travel and delay cannot be reimbursed under the Fishermen's Protective Act;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) the Fishermen's Protective Act of 1967 should be amended to permit vessel owners to be reimbursed for fees required by a foreign government to be paid in advance in order to navigate in the waters of that foreign country if the United States considers that fee to be inconsistent with international law;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the Secretary of State should seek to recover from Canada any amounts paid by the United States to reimburse vessel owners who paid the transit license fee;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) the United States should review its current policy with respect to anchorage by commercial fishing vessels of Canada in waters of the United States off Alaska, including waters in and near the Dixon Entrance, and should accord such vessels the same treatment that commercial fishing vessels of the United States are accorded for anchorage in the waters of Canada off British Columbia;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) the President should ensure that, consistent with international law, the United States Coast Guard has available adequate resources in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska to provide for the safety of United States citizens, the enforcement of United States law, and to protect the rights of the United States and keep the peace among vessels operating in disputed waters;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) the President should continue to review all agreements between the United States and Canada to identify other actions that may be taken to convince Canada that any reinstatement of the transit license fee would be against Canada's long-term interests, and should immediately implement any actions which the President deems appropriate if Canada reinstates the fee;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) the President should continue to convey to Canada in the strongest terms that the United States will not now, nor at any time in the future, tolerate any action by Canada which would impede or otherwise restrict the right of passage of vessels of the United States in a manner inconsistent with international law; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(13) the United States should continue its efforts to seek expeditious agreement with Canada on appropriate fishery conservation and management measures that can be implemented through the Pacific Salmon Treaty to address issues of mutual concern.&rdquo;</p>
