<h4 class="note-head">Recycling Balance-of-Payments Surpluses by Oil Exporting Countries</h4>
<p class="note-body">Section 4(a) of Pub. L. 96&ndash;389 provided that: &ldquo;It is the sense of the Congress that (1) the interests of the United States and those of other member countries require an effective International Monetary Fund equipped with resources adequate to facilitate orderly balance-of-payments adjustments; (2) persistent balance-of-payments surpluses in oil exporting countries have placed, and will continue to place, severe strains on the resources of oil importing countries and on the liquidity of the Fund; (3) these strains can only be relieved if the oil exporting countries assume a greater burden for financing balance-of-payments deficits through direct methods of recycling their surpluses and through proportionally greater contributions to the Fund and to the international lending institutions; and (4) the Fund must explore innovative proposals to encourage more direct recycling of oil surpluses and to increase its own liquidity.&rdquo;</p>
