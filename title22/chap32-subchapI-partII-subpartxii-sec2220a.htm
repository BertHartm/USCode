<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional objectives and findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that, in order to achieve the mutual goals among nations of ensuring food security, human health, agricultural growth, trade expansion, and the wise and sustainable use of natural resources, the United States should mobilize the capacities of the United States land-grant universities, other eligible universities, and public and private partners of universities in the United States and other countries, consistent with sections 2151a and 2151a&ndash;1 of this title, for: (1) global research on problems affecting food, agriculture, forestry, and fisheries; (2) improved human capacity and institutional resource development for the global application of agricultural and related environmental sciences; (3) agricultural development and trade research and extension services in the United States and other countries to support the entry of rural industries into world markets; and (4) providing for the application of agricultural sciences to solving food, health, nutrition, rural income, and environmental problems, especially such problems in low-income, food deficit countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress so declares because it finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) that the establishment, endowment, and continuing support of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress with and through the private sector in this country and to understanding processes of economic development;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with international agencies, educational and research institutions in other countries, the private sector, and nongovernmental organizations worldwide, in expanding global agricultural production, processing, business and trade, to the benefit of aid recipient countries and of the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) that, in a world of growing populations with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger and ensure human health and child survival, but to build the basis for economic growth and trade, and the social security in which democracy and a market economy can thrive, and moreover, that the greatest potential for increasing world food supplies and incomes to purchase food is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current incomes are lowest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) that, with expanding global markets and increasing imports into many countries, including the United States, food safety and quality, as well as secure supply, have emerged as mutual concerns of all countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional and policy development therefore are prime factors in improving agricultural production, food distribution, processing, storage, and marketing abroad (as well as in the United States);</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture and the broader economy of the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(H) that there is a need to responsibly manage the world's agricultural and natural resources for sustained productivity, health and resilience to climate variability; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(I) that universities and public and private partners of universities need a dependable source of funding in order to increase the impact of their own investments and those of their State governments and constituencies, in order to continue and expand their efforts to advance agricultural development in cooperating countries, to translate development into economic growth and trade for the United States and cooperating countries, and to prepare future teachers, researchers, extension specialists, entrepreneurs, managers, and decisionmakers for the world economy.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional declaration for collation of components to increase world food production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Accordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, the following components must be brought together in a coordinated program to increase world food and fiber production, agricultural trade, and responsible management of natural resources, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) continued efforts by the international agricultural research centers and other international research entities to provide a global network, including United States universities, for international scientific collaboration on crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems of worldwide importance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) contract research and the implementation of collaborative research support programs and other research collaboration led by United States universities, and involving research systems in other countries focused on crops, livestock, forests, fisheries, farming resources, and food systems, with benefits to the United States and partner countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) broadly disseminating the benefits of global agricultural research and development including increased benefits for United States agriculturally related industries through establishment of development and trade information and service centers, for rural as well as urban communities, through extension, cooperatively with, and supportive of, existing public and private trade and development related organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) facilitation of participation by universities and public and private partners of uni<!-- PDFPage:562 -->versities in programs of multilateral banks and agencies which receive United States funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) expanding learning opportunities about global agriculture for students, teachers, community leaders, entrepreneurs, and the general public through international internships and exchanges, graduate assistantships, faculty positions, and other means of education and extension through long-term recurring Federal funds matched by State funds; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) competitive grants through universities to United States agriculturalists and public and private partners of universities from other countries for research, institution and policy development, extension, training, and other programs for global agricultural development, trade, and responsible management of natural resources.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) University involvement, participation, and cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) effectively involve the United States land-grant and other eligible universities more extensively in each of the program components described in paragraphs (1) through (6) of subsection (b) of this section;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide mechanisms for the universities and public and private partners of universities to participate and advise in the planning, development, implementation, and administration of each component;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assist such universities and public and private partners of universities in cooperative joint efforts with&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) agricultural institutions in developing nations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) regional and international agricultural research centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) multilateral banks and agencies receiving United States funds;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) development agencies of other countries; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) United States Government foreign assistance and economic cooperation programs;</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) generally engage the United States university community more extensively in the agricultural research, trade, and development initiatives undertaken outside the United States, with the objectives of strengthening its capacity to carry out research, teaching, and extension activities for solving problems in food production, processing, marketing, and consumption in agriculturally developing nations, and for transforming progress in global agricultural research and development into economic growth, trade, and trade benefits for aid recipient countries and United States communities and industries, and for the wise use of natural resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) ensure that all federally funded support to universities and public and private partners of universities relating to the goals of this subpart is periodically reviewed for its performance.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">International Food Reserve</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 95&ndash;426, title VI, &sect;604, Oct. 7, 1978, 92 Stat. 986, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) half a billion people suffer regularly from malnutrition or undernutrition;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) even very modest shortfalls in crop production can result in greatly increased human suffering, and undercut the benefits of bilateral and multilateral assistance programs, in poor developing countries with chronic food deficits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) increasing variability in world food production and trade presents a serious threat not only to consumers but also to producers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the World Food Conference recognized the urgent need for an international undertaking to achieve a system of world food security based largely upon strategic food reserves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Congress through legislation has repeatedly urged the President to negotiate with other nations to establish such a system of reserves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) although the nations of the world have agreed to begin discussions on a system of grain reserves to regulate food availability, agreement on a global network of nationally held reserves still eludes the international community;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) while some progress has taken place in the United States in creating domestic farmer held re<!-- PDFPage:564 -->serves, the scale of such reserves does not insure adequate protection against fluctuations in world production and price; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the United States, as the world's leading producer of foodstuffs, remains in a unique position to provide the leadership necessary to make world food security a reality.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 95&ndash;426, title VII, &sect;711, Oct. 7, 1978, 92 Stat. 994, which authorized funds to be appropriated for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 for a commission to conduct studies on global hunger and malnutrition, which commission was to make recommendations to the President and Congress on policies to increase the capacity of the United States to reduce hunger and malnutrition, was repealed by Pub.

<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) encourage, support, and expedite, studies relating to the long-range implications of the world food situation (including studies of national and world production, distribution, and utilization of agricultural commodities and other foodstuffs) and support the organizing of a world food conference under United Nations auspices in 1974;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) request the member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to explore the means for assuring equitable access by all nations to national markets and mineral and agricultural resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) consult and cooperate with appropriate international agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in determining the need for, the feasibility of, and cost on an equitably-shared basis of, establishing an international system of strategic food reserves; and</p>
