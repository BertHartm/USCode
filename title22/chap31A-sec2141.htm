<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) The travel and tourism industry is the second largest service and retail industry in the United States, and travel and tourism services ranked as the largest United States export in 1995, generating an $18.6 billion surplus for the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Domestic and international travel and tourism expenditures totaled $433 billion in 1995, $415 billion spent directly within the United States and an additional $18 billion spent by international travelers on United States carriers traveling to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Direct travel and tourism receipts make up 6 percent of the United States gross domestic product.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) In 1994, the travel and tourism industry was the nation's second largest employer, directly responsible for 6.3 million jobs and indirectly responsible for another 8 million jobs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) Employment in major sectors of the travel and tourism industry is expected to increase 35 percent by the year 2005.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) 99.7 percent of travel businesses are defined by the Federal government&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2141_1_target" name="2141_1">1</a></sup> as small businesses.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) The White House Conference on Travel and Tourism in 1995 recommended the establishment of a new national tourism organization to represent and promote international travel and tourism to the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) Recent Federal tourism promotion efforts have failed to stem the rapid erosion of our country's international tourism market share.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) In fact, the United States&rsquo; share of worldwide travel receipts dropped from a peak of 19.3 percent in 1992 down to 15.7 percent by the end of 1994.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) The United States has now fallen to only the third leading international destination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Because the United States Travel and Tourism Administration had insufficient resources and effectiveness to reverse the recent decline in the United States&rsquo; share of international travel and tourism, Congress discontinued USTTA's funding.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) Promotion of the United States&rsquo; international travel and tourism interests can be more effectively managed by a private organization at less cost to the taxpayers.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Purpose</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The purpose of this chapter is to create a privately managed, federally sanctioned United States National Tourism Organization to represent and promote United States international travel and tourism.</p>
