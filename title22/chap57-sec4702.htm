<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds and declares that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) it is in the national interest for the United States Government to provide a stable <!-- PDFPage:1125 -->source of financial support to give students in developing countries the opportunity to study in the United States, in order to improve the range and quality of educational alternatives, increase mutual understanding, and build lasting links between those countries and the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) providing scholarships to foreign students to study in the United States has proven over time to be an effective means of creating strong bonds between the United States and the future leadership of developing countries and, at the same time, assists countries substantially in their development efforts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) study in United States institutions by foreign students enhances trade and economic relationships by providing strong English language skills and establishing professional and business contacts;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) students from families of limited financial means have, in the past, largely not had the opportunity to study in the United States, and scholarship programs sponsored by the United States have made no provision for identifying, preparing, or supporting such students for study in the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) it is essential that the United States citizenry develop its knowledge and understanding of the developing countries and their languages, cultures, and socioeconomic composition as these areas assume an ever larger role in the world community;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) an undergraduate scholarship program for students of limited financial means from developing countries to study in the United States would complement current assistance efforts in the areas of advanced education and training of people of developing countries in such disciplines as are required for planning and implementation of public and private development activities;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) the National Bipartisan Commission on Central America has recommended a program of 10,000 United States Government-sponsored scholarships to bring Central American students to the United States, which program would involve careful targeting to encourage participation by young people from all social and economic classes, would maintain existing admission standards by providing intensive English and other training, and would encourage graduates to return to their home countries after completing their education; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) it is also in the interest of the United States, as well as peaceful cooperation in the Western Hemisphere, that particular attention be given to the students of the Caribbean region.</p>

<p class="note-body">1993&mdash;Pars. (6) to (10). Pub. L. 103&ndash;199 redesignated pars. (8) to (10) as (6) to (8), respectively, and struck out former pars. (6) and (7) which read as follows:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(6) the number of United States Government-sponsored scholarships for students in developing countries has been exceeded as much as twelve times in a given year by the number of scholarships offered by Soviet-bloc governments to students in developing countries, and this disparity entails the serious long-run cost of having so many of the potential future leaders of the developing world educated in Soviet-bloc countries;</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(7) from 1972 through 1982 the Soviet Union and Eastern European governments collectively increased their education exchange programs to Latin America and the Caribbean by 205 percent while those of the United States declined by 52 percent;&rdquo;.</p>
