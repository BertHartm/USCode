<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Transfer of personnel from ACDA and USIA</h4>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Transfer of personnel from AID</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as otherwise provided in subchapter III of this chapter, not later than the date of transfer of any function of AID to the Department of State under this chapter, all AID personnel performing such functions and all positions associated with such functions shall be transferred to the Department of State at the same grade or class and the same rate of basic pay or basic salary rate and with the same tenure held immediately preceding transfer.</p>

In carrying out the reorganization under this Act, the Secretary shall ensure that the advances made in increasing the number and status of women and minorities within the foreign affairs agencies of the Federal Government, in terms of representation within the agencies as well as relative rank, are not undermined by discrimination within the newly reorganized Department of State. The Secretary shall consult with the relevant exclusive representatives (as defined in section 4102 of this title and in section 7103 of title 5) with regard to the exercise of this authority. This subsection does not authorize the Secretary to assign any individual to any position that by law requires appointment by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate.</p>
