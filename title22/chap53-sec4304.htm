<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Benefits through Secretary as mandatory; compliance with terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">If the Secretary determines that such action is reasonably necessary on the basis of reciprocity or otherwise&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) to facilitate relations between the United States and a sending State,</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) to protect the interests of the United States,</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">then the Secretary may require a foreign mission (A) to obtain benefits from or through the <!-- PDFPage:1201 -->Secretary on such terms and conditions as the Secretary may approve, or (B) to forego the acceptance, use, or relation of any benefit or to comply with such terms and conditions as the Secretary may determine as a condition to the execution or performance in the United States of any contract or other agreement, the acquisition, retention, or use of any real property, or the application for or acceptance of any benefit (including any benefit from or authorized by any Federal, State, or municipal governmental authority, or any entity providing public services).</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Agent for waiver of recourse</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For purposes of effectuating a waiver of recourse which is required under this section, the Secretary may designate any officer of the Department of State as the agent of a foreign mission (or of any assignee of or person deriving rights from a foreign mission). Any such waiver by an officer so designated shall for all purposes (including any court or administrative proceeding) be deemed to be a waiver by the foreign mission (or the assignee of or other person deriving rights from a foreign mission).</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Secret Service protection</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to preclude or limit in any way the authority of the United States Secret Service to provide protective services pursuant to section 202 of title 3 or section 3056 of title 18 at a level commensurate with protective requirements as determined by the United States Secret Service.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Secretary of State shall prescribe regulations for the implementation of any in-kind exchange of properties pursuant to subsection (b)(5) of this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(4) At least 15 days before entering into any reciprocal agreement for the exchange of property with another foreign government, the Secretary of State shall notify the Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Committee on Public Works and Transportation of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(5)(A) Proceeds from the disposition of properties acquired pursuant to this subsection shall be credited to the Foreign Service Buildings Fund (referred to in section 9 of the Foreign Service Buildings Act, 1926 [22 U.S.C. 300]).</p>
