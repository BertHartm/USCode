<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that in order to maintain and enhance international confidence in the effectiveness of IAEA safeguards and in other multilateral undertakings to halt the global proliferation of nuclear weapons, the United States should seek to negotiate with other nations and groups of nations, including the IAEA Board of Governors and the Nuclear Suppliers Group, to&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) build international support for the principle that nuclear supply relationships must require purchasing nations to agree to full-scope international safeguards;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) encourage each nuclear-weapon state within the meaning of the Treaty to under<!-- PDFPage:1416 -->take a comprehensive review of its own procedures for declassifying information relating to the design or production of nuclear explosive devices and to investigate any measures that would reduce the risk of such information contributing to nuclear weapons proliferation;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) encourage the deferral of efforts to produce weapons-grade nuclear material for large-scale commercial uses until such time as safeguards are developed that can detect, on a timely and reliable basis, the diversion of significant quantities of such material for nuclear explosive purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) pursue greater financial support for the implementation and improvement of safeguards from all IAEA member nations with significant nuclear programs, particularly from those nations that are currently using or planning to use weapons-grade nuclear material for commercial purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) arrange for the timely payment of annual financial contributions by all members of the IAEA, including the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) pursue the elimination of international commerce in highly enriched uranium for use in research reactors while encouraging multilateral cooperation to develop and to use low-enriched alternative nuclear fuels;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) oppose efforts by non-nuclear-weapon states to develop or use unsafeguarded nuclear fuels for purposes of naval propulsion;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) pursue an international open skies arrangement that would authorize the IAEA to operate surveillance aircraft and would facilitate IAEA access to satellite information for safeguards verification purposes;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) develop an institutional means for IAEA member nations to share intelligence material with the IAEA on possible safeguards violations without compromising national security or intelligence sources or methods;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) require any exporter of a sensitive nuclear facility or sensitive nuclear technology to a non-nuclear-weapon state to notify the IAEA prior to export and to require safeguards over that facility or technology, regardless of its destination; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) seek agreement among the parties to the Treaty to apply IAEA safeguards in perpetuity and to establish new limits on the right to withdraw from the Treaty.</p>
