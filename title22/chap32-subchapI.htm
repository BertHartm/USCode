<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) United States development cooperation policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that fundamental political, economic, and technological changes have resulted in the interdependence of nations. The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect individual civil and economic rights and freedoms and which work together to use wisely the world's limited resources in an open and equitable international economic system. Furthermore, the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of the American people and renews its commitment to assist people in devel<!-- PDFPage:434 -->oping countries to eliminate hunger, poverty, illness, and ignorance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Therefore, the Congress declares that a principal objective of the foreign policy of the United States is the encouragement and sustained support of the people of developing countries in their efforts to acquire the knowledge and resources essential to development and to build the economic, political, and social institutions which will improve the quality of their lives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">United States development cooperation policy should emphasize four principal goals:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the alleviation of the worst physical manifestations of poverty among the world's poor majority;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the promotion of conditions enabling developing countries to achieve self-sustaining economic growth with equitable distribution of benefits;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) the encouragement of development processes in which individual civil and economic rights are respected and enhanced; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) the integration of the developing countries into an open and equitable international economic system.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that pursuit of these goals requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United States foreign policy and that United States development resources be effectively and efficiently utilized.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Coordination of development-related activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Under the policy guidance of the Secretary of State, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should have the responsibility for coordinating all United States development-related activities.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">African Conflict Resolution</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 103&ndash;381, Oct. 19, 1994, 108 Stat. 3513, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION. 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;African Conflict Resolution Act&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF POLICY.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) It is in the national interest of the United States to help build African capability in conflict resolution. A relatively small investment of assistance in promoting African conflict resolution&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(A) would reduce the enormous human suffering which is caused by wars in Africa;</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(B) would help the United States avoid huge future expenditures necessitated by Somalia-like humanitarian disasters; and</p>
<p class="note-body-2em">&ldquo;(C) would reduce the need for United Nations intervention as African institutions develop the ability to resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Africa, to a greater extent than any other continent, is afflicted by war. Africa has been marred by more than 20 major civil wars since 1960. Rwanda, Somalia, Angola, Sudan, Liberia, and Burundi are among those countries that have recently suffered serious armed conflict.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) In the last decade alone, between 2,000,000 and 4,000,000 Africans have died because of war. There were 5,200,000 refugees and 13,100,000 displaced people in Africa in 1993.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Millions more Africans are currently at risk of war-related death. Looming or ongoing conflicts in Zaire, Angola, Sudan, Rwanda, and other countries threaten Africa's future.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) War has caused untold economic and social damage to the countries of Africa. Food production is impossible in conflict areas, and famine often results. Widespread conflict has condemned many of Africa's children to lives of misery and, in certain cases, has threatened the existence of traditional African cultures.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) Conflict and instability in Africa, particularly in large, potentially rich countries such as Angola, Sudan, and Zaire, deprive the global economy of resources and opportunities for trade and investment. Peace in these countries could make a significant contribution to global economic growth, while creating new opportunities for United States businesses.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Excessive military expenditures threaten political and economic stability in Africa while diverting scarce resources from development needs. Demobilization and other measures to reduce the size of African armies, and civilian control of the military under the rule of law are in the interest of international security and economic development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) Conflict prevention, mediation, and demobilization are prerequisites to the success of development assistance programs. Nutrition and education programs, for example, cannot succeed in a nation at war. Billions of dollars of development assistance have been virtually wasted in war-ravaged countries such as Liberia, Somalia, and Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9) Africans have a long tradition of informal mediation. This tradition should be built upon to create effective institutions through which Africans can resolve African conflicts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10) The effectiveness of U.S. support for conflict resolution programs requires coordination and collaboration with multilateral institutions and other bilateral donors.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(11) African institutions are playing an active role in conflict resolution and mediation utilizing the experience of elder statesmen. Groups such as the All African Council of Churches have assisted in defusing conflicts. The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has sought to address the conflict in Liberia by deploying an African peacekeeping force. The Southern African states have been working to prevent a crisis in Lesotho. The Intergovernmental Authority on Desertification and Drought (IGADD) has been engaged in attempting to resolve the conflict in Sudan.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(12) The Organization of African Unity, under the leadership of Secretary General Salim Salim, has established a conflict resolution mechanism and has been active in mediation and conflict resolution in several African countries.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) <cap-smallcap>United States Policy</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;The Congress declares, therefore, that a key goal for United States foreign policy should be to help institutionalize conflict resolution capability in Africa.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151&ndash;1. Development assistance policy</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Principal purpose of bilateral development assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the efforts of developing countries to build and maintain the social and economic institutions necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth and to provide opportunities to improve the quality of life for their people depend primarily upon successfully marshalling their own economic and human resources. The Congress recognizes that the magnitude of these efforts exceeds the resources of developing countries and therefore accepts that there will be a long-term need for wealthy countries to contribute additional resources for development purposes. The United States should take the lead in concert with other nations to mobilize such resources from public and private sources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Provision of development resources must be adapted to the needs and capabilities of specific developing countries. United States assistance to countries with low per capita incomes which have limited access to private external resources should primarily be provided on concessional terms. Assistance to other developing countries should generally consist of programs which facilitate their access to private capital markets, investment, and technical skills, whether directly through guarantee or reimbursable programs by the United States Government or indirectly through callable capital provided to the international financial institutions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Bilateral assistance and United States participation in multilateral institutions shall emphasize programs in support of countries which pursue development strategies designed to meet basic human needs and achieve self-sustaining growth with equity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that the principal purpose of United States bilateral development assistance is to help the poor majority of people in developing countries to participate in a process of equitable growth through productive work and to influence decisions that shape their lives, with the goal of increasing their incomes and their access to public services which will enable them to satisfy their basic needs and lead lives of decency, dignity, and hope. Activities shall be emphasized that effectively involve the poor in development by expanding their access to the economy through services and institutions at the local level, increasing their participation in the making of decisions that affect their lives, increasing labor-intensive production and the use of appropriate technology, expanding productive investment and services out from major cities to small towns and rural areas, and otherwise providing opportunities for the poor to improve their lives through their own efforts. Par<!-- PDFPage:448 -->ticipation of the United States in multilateral institutions shall also place appropriate emphasis on these principles.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Form of assistance; principles governing assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance under this part should be used not only for the purpose of transferring financial resources to developing countries, but also to help countries solve development problems in accordance with a strategy that aims to insure wide participation of the poor in the benefits of development on a sustained basis. Moreover, assistance shall be provided in a prompt and effective manner, using appropriate United States institutions for carrying out this strategy. In order to achieve these objectives and the broad objectives set forth in section 2151 of this title and in subsection (a) of this section, bilateral development assistance authorized by this chapter shall be carried out in accordance with the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Development is primarily the responsibility of the people of the developing countries themselves. Assistance from the United States shall be used in support of, rather than substitution for, the self-help efforts that are essential to successful development programs and shall be concentrated in those countries that take positive steps to help themselves. Maximum effort shall be made, in the administration of subchapter I of this chapter, to stimulate the involvement of the people in the development process through the encouragement of democratic participation in private and local governmental activities and institution building appropriate to the requirements of the recipient countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Development planning must be the responsibility of each sovereign country. United States assistance should be administered in a collaborative style to support the development goals chosen by each country receiving assistance.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) United States bilateral development assistance should give high priority to undertakings submitted by host governments which directly improve the lives of the poorest of their people and their capacity to participate in the development of their countries, while also helping such governments enhance their planning, technical, and administrative capabilities needed to insure the success of such undertakings.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) Development assistance provided under this part shall be concentrated in countries which will make the most effective use of such assistance to help satisfy basic human needs of poor people through equitable growth, especially in those countries having the greatest need for outside assistance. In order to make possible consistent and informed judgments in this respect, the President shall assess the commitment and progress of countries in moving toward the objectives and purposes of this part by utilizing criteria, including but not limited to the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) increase in agricultural productivity per unit of land through small-farm, labor-intensive agriculture;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) reduction of infant mortality;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) control of population growth;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) promotion of greater equality of income distribution, including measures such as more progressive taxation and more equitable returns to small farmers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) reduction of rates of unemployment and underemployment; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) increase in literacy.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) United States development assistance should focus on critical problems in those functional sectors which affect the lives of the majority of the people in the developing countries; food production and nutrition; rural development and generation of gainful employment; population planning and health; environment and natural resources; education, development administration, and human resource development; and energy development and production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) United States assistance shall encourage and promote the participation of women in the national economies of developing countries and the improvement of women's status as an important means of promoting the total development effort.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) United States bilateral assistance shall recognize that the prosperity of developing countries and effective development efforts require the adoption of an overall strategy that promotes the development, production, and efficient utilization of energy and, therefore, consideration shall be given to the full implications of such assistance on the price, availability, and consumption of energy in recipient countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) United States cooperation in development should be carried out to the maximum extent possible through the private sector, including those institutions which already have ties in the developing areas, such as educational institutions, cooperatives, credit unions, free labor unions, and private and voluntary agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To the maximum extent practicable, United States private investment should be encouraged in economic and social development programs to which the United States lends support.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) Assistance shall be planned and utilized to encourage regional cooperation by developing countries in the solution of common problems and the development of shared resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) Assistance efforts of the United States shall be planned and furnished to the maximum extent practicable in coordination and cooperation with assistance efforts of other countries, including the planning and implementation of programs and projects on a multilateral and multidonor basis.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) United States bilateral development assistance should be concentrated on projects which do not involve large-scale capital transfers. However, to the extent that such assistance does involve large-scale capital transfers, it should be furnished in association with contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) United States encouragement of policy reforms is necessary if developing countries are to achieve economic growth with equity.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Development assistance should, as a fundamental objective, promote private sector ac<!-- PDFPage:449 -->tivity in open and competitive markets in developing countries, recognizing such activity to be a productive and efficient means of achieving equitable and long term economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) United States cooperation in development should recognize as essential the need of developing countries to have access to appropriate technology in order to improve food and water, health and housing, education and employment, and agriculture and industry.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(16) United States assistance should focus on establishing and upgrading the institutional capacities of developing countries in order to promote long term development. An important component of institution building involves training to expand the human resource potential of people in developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Worldwide cooperative effort to overcome aspects of absolute poverty</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress, recognizing the desirability of overcoming the worst aspects of absolute poverty by the end of this century by, among other measures, substantially lowering infant mortality and birth rates, and increasing life expectancy, food production, literacy, and employment, encourages the President to explore with other countries, through all appropriate channels, the feasibility of a worldwide cooperative effort to overcome the worst aspects of absolute poverty and to assure self-reliant growth in the developing countries by the year 2000.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151a. Agricultural development in rural areas</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Authorization to President to furnish assistance; appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In recognition of the fact that the great majority of the people of developing countries live in rural areas and are dependent on agriculture and agricultural-related pursuits for their livelihood, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for agriculture, rural development, and nutrition&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to alleviate starvation, hunger, and malnutrition;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to expand significantly the provision of basic services to rural poor people to enhance their capacity for self-help; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) to help create productive farm and off-farm employment in rural areas to provide a more viable economic base and enhance opportunities for improved incomes, living standards, and contributions by rural poor people to the economic and social development of their countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $760,000,000 for fiscal year 1987. Of these amounts, the President may use such amounts as he deems appropriate to carry out the provisions of section 316 of the International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1980. Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated in paragraph (2) for the fiscal year 1987, not less than $2,000,000 shall be available only for the purpose of controlling and eradicating amblyomma variegatum (heartwater) in bovine animals in the Caribbean.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Use of assistance primarily in aid of rural poor; multilateral infrastructure projects; forestry projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Assistance provided under this section shall be used primarily for activities which are specifically designed to increase the productivity and income of the rural poor, through such means as creation and strengthening of local institutions linked to the regional and national levels; organization of a system of financial institutions which provide both savings and credit services to the poor; stimulation of small, labor-intensive enterprises in rural towns; improvement of marketing facilities and systems; expansion of rural infrastructure and utilities such as farm-to-market roads, water management systems, land improvement, energy, and storage facilities; establishment of more equitable and more secure land tenure arrangements; and creation and strengthening of sys<!-- PDFPage:450 -->tems to provide other services and supplies needed by farmers, such as extension, research, training, fertilizer, water, forestry, soil conservation, and improved seed, in ways which assure access to them by small farmers.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) In circumstances where development of major infrastructure is necessary to achieve the objectives set forth in this section, assistance for that purpose should be furnished under this part in association with significant contributions from other countries working together in a multilateral framework. Infrastructure projects so assisted should be complemented by other measures to ensure that the benefits of the infrastructure reach the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress recognizes that the accelerating loss of forests and tree cover in developing countries undermines and offsets efforts to improve agricultural production and nutrition and otherwise to meet the basic human needs of the poor. Deforestation results in increased flooding, reduction in water supply for agricultural capacity, loss of firewood and needed wood products, and loss of valuable plants and animals. In order to maintain and increase forest resources, the President is authorized to provide assistance under this section for forestry projects which are essential to fulfill the fundamental purposes of this section. Emphasis shall be given to community woodlots, agroforestry, reforestation, protection of watershed forests, and more effective forest management.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Increased agricultural production in least developed countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the greatest potential for significantly expanding availability of food for people in rural areas and augmenting world food production at relatively low cost lies in increasing the productivity of small farmers who constitute a majority of the agricultural producers in developing countries. Increasing the emphasis on rural development and expanded food production in the poorest nations of the developing world is a matter of social justice and a principal element contributing to broadly based economic growth, as well as an important factor in alleviating inflation in the industrialized countries. In the allocation of funds under this section, special attention shall be given to increasing agricultural production in countries which have been designated as &ldquo;least developed&rdquo; by the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Coordination with population planning and health programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Assistance provided under this section shall also be used in coordination with programs carried out under section 2151b of this title to help improve nutrition of the people of developing countries through encouragement of increased production of crops with greater nutritional value; improvement of planning, research, and education with respect to nutrition, particularly with reference to improvement and expanded use of indigenously produced foodstuffs; and the undertaking of pilot or demonstration programs explicitly addressing the problem of malnutrition of poor and vulnerable people. In particular, the President is encouraged&mdash;</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151b. Population planning and health programs</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional declaration of policy</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that poor health conditions and uncontrolled population growth can vitiate otherwise successful development efforts.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Large families in developing countries are the result of complex social and economic factors which change relatively slowly among the poor majority least affected by economic progress, as well as the result of a lack of effective birth control. Therefore, effective family planning depends upon economic and social change as well as the delivery of services and is often a matter of political and religious sensitivity. While every country has the right to determine its own policies with respect to population growth, voluntary population planning programs can make a substantial contribution to economic development, higher living standards, and improved health and nutrition.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">Good health conditions are a principal element in improved quality of life and contribute to the individual's capacity to participate in the development process, while poor health and debilitating disease can limit productivity.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance for voluntary population planning</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to increase the opportunities and motivation for family planning and to reduce the rate of population growth, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for voluntary population planning. In addition to the provision of family planning information and services, including also information and services which relate to and support natural family planning methods, and the conduct of directly relevant demographic research, population planning programs shall emphasize motivation for small families.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance for health programs; special health needs of children and mothers; Child Survival Fund; promotion of immunization and oral rehydration</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to contribute to improvements in the health of the greatest number of poor people in developing countries, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for health programs. Assistance under this subsection shall be used primarily for basic integrated health services, safe water and sanitation, disease prevention and control, and related health planning and research. This assistance shall emphasize self-sustaining community-based health programs by means such as training of health auxiliary and other appropriate personnel, support for the establishment and evaluation of projects that can be replicated on a broader scale, measures to improve management of health programs, and other services and supplies to support health and disease prevention programs.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2)(A) In carrying out the purposes of this subsection, the President shall promote, encourage, and undertake activities designed to deal directly with the special health needs of children and mothers. Such activities should utilize simple, available technologies which can significantly reduce childhood mortality, such as improved and expanded immunization programs, oral rehydration to combat diarrhoeal diseases, and education programs aimed at improving nutrition and sanitation and at promoting child spacing. In carrying out this paragraph, guidance shall be sought from knowledgeable health professionals from outside the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter. In addition to government-to-government programs, activities pursuant to this paragraph should include support for appropriate activities of the types described in this paragraph which are carried out by international organizations (which may include international organizations receiving funds under part III of this subchapter) and by private and voluntary organizations, and should include encouragement to other donors to support such types of activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) In addition to amounts otherwise available for such purpose, there are authorized to be appropriated to the President $25,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $75,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 for use in carrying out this paragraph. Amounts appropriated under this subparagraph are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Appropriations pursuant to subparagraph (B) may be referred to as the &ldquo;Child Survival Fund&rdquo;.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) The Congress recognizes that the promotion of primary health care is a major objec<!-- PDFPage:453 -->tive of the foreign assistance program. The Congress further recognizes that simple, relatively low cost means already exist to reduce incidence of communicable diseases among children, mothers, and infants. The promotion of vaccines for immunization, and salts for oral rehydration, therefore, is an essential feature of the health assistance program. To this end, the Congress expects the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter to set as a goal the protection of not less than 80 percent of all children, in those countries in which such agency has established development programs, from immunizable diseases by January 1, 1991. Of the aggregate amounts made available for fiscal year 1987 to carry out paragraph (2) of this subsection (relating to the Child Survival Fund) and to carry out subsection (c) of this section (relating to development assistance for health), $50,000,000 shall be used to carry out this paragraph.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Administration of assistance</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Assistance under this part shall be administered so as to give particular attention to the interrelationship between (A) population growth, and (B) development and overall improvement in living standards in developing countries, and to the impact of all programs, projects, and activities on population growth. All appropriate activities proposed for financing under this part shall be designed to build motivation for smaller families through modification of economic and social conditions supportive of the desire for large families, in programs such as education in and out of school, nutrition, disease control, maternal and child health services, improvements in the status and employment of women, agricultural production, rural development, and assistance to the urban poor, and through community-based development programs which give recognition to people motivated to limit the size of their families. Population planning programs shall be coordinated with other programs aimed at reducing the infant mortality rate, providing better nutrition for pregnant women and infants, and raising the standard of living of the poor.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Since the problems of malnutrition, disease, and rapid population growth are closely related, planning for assistance to be provided under subsections (b) and (c) of this section and under section 2151a of this title shall be coordinated to the maximum extent practicable.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) Assistance provided under this section shall emphasize low-cost integrated delivery systems for health, nutrition, and family planning for the poorest people, with particular attention to the needs of mothers and young children, using paramedical and auxiliary medical personnel, clinics and health posts, commercial distribution systems, and other modes of community outreach.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Research and analysis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Health and population research and analysis carried out under this chapter shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) be undertaken to the maximum extent practicable in developing countries by developing country personnel, linked as appropriate with private and governmental biomedical research facilities within the United States;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) take account of the special needs of the poor people of developing countries in the determination of research priorities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) make extensive use of field testing to adapt basic research to local conditions.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President is authorized to study the complex factors affecting population growth in developing countries and to identify factors which might motivate people to plan family size or to space their children.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Prohibition on use of funds for performance or research respecting abortions or involuntary sterilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of abortions as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilizations as a method of family planning or to coerce or provide any financial incentive to any person to undergo sterilizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) None of the funds made available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter may be used to pay for any biomedical research which relates, in whole or in part, to methods of, or the performance of, abortions or involuntary sterilization as a means of family planning.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $290,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (b) of this section; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) $205,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $180,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 to carry out subsection (c) of this section.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Funds appropriated under this subsection are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151d. Development of indigenous energy resources</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1)(A) The Congress finds that energy development and production are vital elements in the development process, that energy shortages in developing countries severely limit the development process in such countries, that two-thirds <!-- PDFPage:456 -->of the developing countries which import oil depend on it for at least 90 percent of the energy which their economies require, and that the dramatic increase in world oil prices since 1973 has resulted in considerable economic hardship for many developing countries. The Congress is concerned that the value and purpose of much of the assistance provided to developing countries under sections 2151a, 2151b, and 2151c of this title are undermined by the inability of many developing countries to satisfy their energy requirements. Unless the energy deficit of the developing countries can be narrowed by more fully exploiting indigenous sources of energy such as oil, natural gas, and coal, scarce foreign exchange will increasingly have to be diverted to oil imports, primarily to the detriment of long-term development and economic growth.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) The Congress recognizes that many developing countries lack access to the financial resources and technology necessary to locate, explore, and develop indigenous energy resources.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) The Congress declares that there is potential for at least a moderate increase by 1990 in the production of energy for commercial use in the developing countries which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In addition, there is a compelling need for vigorous efforts to improve the available data on the location, scale, and commercial exploitability of potential oil, natural gas, and coal reserves in developing countries, especially those which are not members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. The Congress further declares that there are many benefits to be gained by the developing countries and by the United States and other developed countries through expanded efforts to expedite the location, exploration, and development of potential sources of energy in developing countries. These benefits include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) The world's energy supply would be increased and the fear of abrupt depletion would be lessened with new energy production. This could have a positive impact upon energy prices in international markets as well as a positive effect upon the balance of payments problems of many developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) Diversification of the world's supplies of energy from fossil fuels would make all countries, developing and developed, less susceptible to supply interruptions and arbitrary production and pricing policies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(iii) Even a moderate increase in energy production in the developing countries would improve their ability to expand commercial trade, foreign investment, and technology transfer possibilities with the United States and other developed countries.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(D) Assistance for the production of energy from indigenous resources, as authorized by subsection (b) of this section, would be of direct benefit to the poor in developing countries because of the overwhelming impact of imported energy costs upon the lives of the poor and their ability to participate in development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The Congress also finds that energy production from renewable, decentralized sources and energy conservation are vital elements in the development process. Inadequate access by the poor to energy sources as well as the prospect of depleted fossil fuel reserves and higher energy prices require an enhanced effort to expand the energy resources of developing countries through greater emphasis on renewable sources. Renewable and decentralized energy technologies have particular applicability for the poor, especially in rural areas.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) General assistance authority; cooperative programs in energy production and conservation; program goals</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In order to help developing countries alleviate their energy problems by improving their ability to use indigenous energy resources to produce the energy needed by their economies, the President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, to enable such countries to prepare for and undertake development of their energy resources. Such assistance may include data collection and analysis, the training of skilled personnel, research on and development of suitable energy sources, and pilot projects to test new methods of energy production.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President is authorized to furnish assistance under this part for cooperative programs with developing countries in energy production and conservation, through research on and development and use of small-scale, decentralized, renewable energy sources for rural areas carried out as integral parts of rural development efforts in accordance with section 2151a of this title. Such programs shall also be directed toward the earliest practicable development and use of energy technologies which are environmentally acceptable, require minimum capital investment, are most acceptable to and affordable by the people using them, are simple and inexpensive to use and maintain, and are transferable from one region of the world to another. Such programs may include research on and the development, demonstration, and application of suitable energy technologies (including use of wood); analysis of energy uses, needs, and resources; training and institutional development; and scientific interchange.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative coordination of planning and implementation of programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter and the Department of Energy shall coordinate with one another, to the maximum extent possible, the planning and implementation of energy programs under this part.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Assistance for programs of technical cooperation and development, research, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to furnish assistance, on such terms and conditions as he may determine, for the following activities, to the extent that such activities are not authorized by sections 2151a, 2151b, and 2151c of this title:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) programs of technical cooperation and development, particularly the development efforts of United States private and voluntary agencies and regional and international development organizations;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) programs of research into, and evaluation of, the process of economic development in less developed countries and areas, into the <!-- PDFPage:457 -->factors affecting the relative success and costs of development activities, and into the means, techniques, and such other aspects of development assistance as the President may determine in order to render such assistance of increasing value and benefit;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) programs of reconstruction following natural or manmade disasters and programs of disaster preparedness, including the prediction of and contingency planning for natural disasters abroad;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) programs designed to help solve special development problems in the poorest countries and to make possible proper utilization of infrastructure and related projects funded with earlier United States assistance; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) programs of urban development, with particular emphasis on small, labor intensive enterprises, marketing systems for small producers, and financial and other institutions which enable the urban poor to participate in the economic and social development of their country.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Authorization of appropriations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) There are authorized to be appropriated to the President for purposes of this section, in addition to funds otherwise available for such purposes, $207,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $207,000,000 for fiscal year 1987.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Amounts appropriated under this section are authorized to remain available until expended.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Financing cooperative projects among United States, Israel, and developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the amounts authorized to be appropriated to carry out this part, $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1986 and $5,000,000 for fiscal year 1987 shall be used to finance cooperative projects among the United States, Israel, and developing countries.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151f. Private sector revolving fund</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Establishment</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the development of private enterprise, including cooperatives, is a vital factor in the stable growth of developing countries and in the development and stability of a free, open, and equitable international economic system. It is therefore in the best interests of the United States to assist the development of the private sector in developing countries and to engage the United States private sector in that process. In order to promote such private sector development, the President is authorized to establish a revolving fund account in the United States Treasury. All funds deposited in such account shall, notwithstanding any provision in an appropriation Act to the contrary, be free from fiscal year limitations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Funding</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Of the funds made available under this part in each of the fiscal years 1986 and 1987, up to $18,000,000 may be deposited in this account. Such funds used in accordance with the policies and authorities of this section shall be in addition to other funds available for private sector activities under other authorities in this chapter. Any reflows and income arising from activities carried out pursuant to this section, including loan repayments and fee income (as provided in subsection (e) of this section), shall be deposited into the revolving fund and remain available to carry out the purposes of this section. All funds in such account may be invested in obligations of the United States.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Authorized uses; determination of small business enterprise; maximum amounts available; interest rate</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter is authorized to use the funds maintained in this revolving fund account to furnish assistance in furtherance of the policy of subsection (a) of this section on such terms and conditions as it may determine. Amounts in the revolving fund account shall be available for obligation for assistance under this section only to such extent as may be provided in advance in appropriation Acts. Assistance may be provided under this section without regard to section&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2151f_1_target" name="2151f_1">1</a></sup> 2354(a) and 2370(r) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Assistance under this section may be provided only to support private sector activities which&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) are consistent with the United States development assistance policies set forth in section 2151&ndash;1 of this title and with the development priorities of the host country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) are the types of activities for which assistance may be provided under sections 2151a through 2151d of this title;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) will have a demonstration effect;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) will be innovative;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) are financially viable;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) will maximize the development impact appropriate to the host country, particularly in employment and the use of appropriate technology; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(G) are primarily directed to making available to small business enterprises and cooperatives necessary support and services which are not otherwise generally available.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">In determining whether an enterprise is a small business enterprise, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall take into consideration the enterprise's total net fixed assets and number of employees, together with the relevant definition utilized by the host country government and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development and other international organizations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3)(A) Not more than $3,000,000 may be made available under this section to support any one project.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Not more than 50 per centum of the financial support for any project may be provided under this section, and a substantial portion of the financial support for a project assisted under this section must be provided by sources within the host country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(C) Not more than 20 per centum of the assets of the revolving fund account under this section may be used to support projects in any one country.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(D) In order to maximize the impact on institution building, loans under this section shall be <!-- PDFPage:459 -->made primarily to intermediary entities which provide necessary support and services for private sector activities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(E) Loans under this section shall be at or near the interest rate otherwise available to the recipient.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Remittance of excess assets</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) If at any time the assets of the revolving fund account exceeds $100,000,000, the President shall remit the amount in excess of $100,000,000 to the United States Treasury.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) As used in this section, &ldquo;assets&rdquo; includes amounts in the revolving fund account plus the value of investments made with amounts from the fund plus the current value of outstanding obligations under loans under this section.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In addition to the requirement of paragraph (1), at the end of any fiscal year, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter may determine that amounts in the revolving fund are sufficient to permit the remittance to the United States Treasury of an amount equal to a portion or the total amount of appropriated funds deposited in the revolving fund. Any such remittance shall be deemed to be a decrease in the appropriated funds in the revolving fund. After remittance has been made of an amount equal to the total amount of appropriated funds, the revolving fund shall consist and be deemed to consist entirely of nonappropriated funds.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fee for carrying out activities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fee may be charged, where appropriate, in carrying out activities with funds from the revolving fund authorized in this section. The amount of any such fee shall be determined by the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Transfer of unobligated funds upon termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the event the revolving fund is terminated, all unobligated money in the fund at the time of such termination shall be transferred to and become part of the miscellaneous receipts account of the Treasury.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Inclusion of proposed projects in annual congressional presentation documents</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As part of its annual congressional presentation documents submitted to the Congress, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall include a description of projects proposed to be funded from the revolving fund account for that fiscal year. To the extent that projects are proposed for funding which are not contained in the annual congressional presentation documents, at least fifteen days advance notification shall be provided to the Congress in accordance with section 2394&ndash;1 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Annual report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Not later than December 31 of each year, the President shall submit to the Congress a comprehensive report which details all projects funded under this section during the previous fiscal year, all reflows to the revolving fund account, a status report on all projects currently contained in the fund's portfolio. Such reports shall include, but not be limited to, information regarding numbers and kinds of beneficiaries reached, amounts and kinds of benefits provided by the funded projects to targeted populations, and a justification for projects within the context of the goals and objectives of the United States development assistance program.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Loan guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) To carry out the purposes of subsection (a) of this section, in addition to the other authorities set forth in this section, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter is authorized to issue guarantees on such terms and conditions as it shall determine assuring against losses incurred in connection with loans made to projects that meet the criteria set forth in subsection (c) of this section. The full faith and credit of the United States is hereby pledged for the full payment and performance of such guarantees.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Loans guaranteed under this subsection shall be on such terms and conditions as the agency may prescribe, except for the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The agency shall issue guarantees only when it is necessary to alleviate a credit market imperfection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Loans guaranteed shall provide for complete amortization within a period not to exceed ten years or, if the principal purpose of the guaranteed loan is to finance the construction or purchase of a physical asset with a useful life of less than ten years, within a period not to exceed such useful life.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) No loan guaranteed to any one borrower may exceed 50 percent of the cost of the activity to be financed, or $3,000,000, whichever is less, as determined by the agency.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) No loan may be guaranteed unless the agency determines that the lender is responsible and that adequate provision is made for servicing the loan on reasonable terms and protecting the financial interest of the United States.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) The fees earned from the loan guarantees issued under this subsection shall be deposited in the revolving fund account as part of the guarantee reserve established under paragraph (5) of this subsection. Fees shall be assessed at a level such that the fees received, plus the funds from the revolving fund account placed in the guarantee reserve, satisfy the requirements of paragraph (5). Fees shall be reviewed every twelve months to ensure that the fees assessed on new loan guarantees are at the required level.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) Any guarantee shall be conclusive evidence that such guarantee has been properly obtained, and that the underlying loan as contracted qualifies for such guarantee.

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional statement of findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that if current trends in the degradation of natural resources in developing countries continue, they will severely undermine the best efforts to meet basic human needs, to achieve sustained economic growth, and to prevent international tension and conflict. The Congress also finds that the world faces enormous, urgent, and complex problems, with respect to natural resources, which require new forms of cooperation between the United States and developing countries to prevent such problems from becoming unmanageable. It is, therefore, in the economic and security interest of the United States to provide leadership both in thoroughly reassessing policies relating to natural resources and the environment, and in cooperating extensively with developing countries in order to achieve environmentally sound development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance authority and emphasis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to address the serious problems described in subsection (a) of this section, the President is authorized to furnish assistance under subchapter I of this chapter for developing and strengthening the capacity of developing countries to protect and manage their environment and natural resources. Special efforts shall be made to maintain and where possible to restore the land, vegetation, water, wildlife, and other resources upon which depend economic growth and human well-being, especially of the poor.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Implementation considerations applicable to programs and projects</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The President, in implementing programs and projects under this part and part X of this subchapter, shall take fully into account the impact of such programs and projects upon the environment and natural resources of developing countries. Subject to such procedures as the President considers appropriate, the President shall require all agencies and officials responsible for programs or projects under this part and part X of this subchapter&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to prepare and take fully into account an environmental impact statement for any program or project under this part and part X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of the global commons outside the jurisdiction of any country, the environment of the United States, or other aspects of the environment which the President may specify; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to prepare and take fully into account an environmental assessment of any proposed program or project under this part and part X of this subchapter significantly affecting the environment of any foreign country.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Such agencies and officials should, where appropriate, use local technical resources in preparing environmental impact statements and environmental assessments pursuant to this subsection.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The President may establish exceptions from the requirements of this subsection for emergency conditions and for cases in which compliance with those requirements would be seriously detrimental to the foreign policy interests of the United States.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151p&ndash;1. Tropical forests</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Importance of forests and tree cover</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In enacting section 2151a(b)(3) of this title the Congress recognized the importance of forests and tree cover to the developing countries. The Congress is particularly concerned about the continuing and accelerating alteration, destruction, and loss of tropical forests in developing countries, which pose a serious threat to development and the environment. Tropical forest destruction and loss&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) result in shortages of wood, especially wood for fuel; loss of biologically productive wetlands; siltation of lakes, reservoirs, and irrigation systems; floods; destruction of indigenous peoples; extinction of plant and animal species; reduced capacity for food production; and loss of genetic resources; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) can result in desertification and destabilization of the earth's climate.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">Properly managed tropical forests provide a sustained flow of resources essential to the economic growth of developing countries, as well as genetic resources of value to developed and developing countries alike.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Priorities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The concerns expressed in subsection (a) of this section and the recommendations of the United States Interagency Task Force on Tropical Forests shall be given high priority by the President&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in formulating and carrying out programs and policies with respect to developing countries, including those relating to bilateral and multilateral assistance and those relating to private sector activities; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) in seeking opportunities to coordinate public and private development and investment activities which affect forests in developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Assistance to developing countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In providing assistance to developing countries, the President shall do the following:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Place a high priority on conservation and sustainable management of tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which stress the importance of conserving and sustainably managing forest resources for the long-term economic benefit of those countries, as well as the irreversible losses associated with forest destruction, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which identify and focus on policies of those countries which directly or indirectly contribute to deforestation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and activities&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) which offer employment and income alternatives to those who otherwise would cause destruction and loss of forests, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) which help developing countries identify and implement alternatives to colonizing forested areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) To the fullest extent feasible, support training programs, educational efforts, and the establishment or strengthening of institutions which increase the capacity of developing countries to formulate forest policies, engage in relevant land-use planning, and otherwise improve the management of their forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) To the fullest extent feasible, help end destructive slash-and-burn agriculture by supporting stable and productive farming practices in areas already cleared or degraded and on lands which inevitably will be settled, with special emphasis on demonstrating the feasibility of agroforestry and other techniques which use technologies and methods suited to the local environment and traditional agricultural techniques and feature close consultation with and involvement of local people.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) To the fullest extent feasible, help conserve forests which have not yet been degraded, by helping to increase production on lands already cleared or degraded through support of reforestation, fuelwood, and other sustainable forestry projects and practices, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) To the fullest extent feasible, support projects and other activities to conserve forested watersheds and rehabilitate those which have been deforested, making sure that local people are involved at all stages of project design and implementation.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) To the fullest extent feasible, support training, research, and other actions which lead to sustainable and more environmentally sound practices for timber harvesting, removal, and processing, including reforestation, soil conservation, and other activities to rehabilitate degraded forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(9) To the fullest extent feasible, support research to expand knowledge of tropical forests <!-- PDFPage:467 -->and identify alternatives which will prevent forest destruction, loss, or degradation, including research in agroforestry, sustainable management of natural forests, small-scale farms and gardens, small-scale animal husbandry, wider application of adopted traditional practices, and suitable crops and crop combinations.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(10) To the fullest extent feasible, conserve biological diversity in forest areas by&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) supporting and cooperating with United States Government agencies, other donors (both bilateral and multilateral), and other appropriate governmental, intergovernmental, and nongovernmental organizations in efforts to identify, establish, and maintain a representative network of protected tropical forest ecosystems on a worldwide basis;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) whenever appropriate, making the establishment of protected areas a condition of support for activities involving forest clearance or degradation; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) helping developing countries identify tropical forest ecosystems and species in need of protection and establish and maintain appropriate protected areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(11) To the fullest extent feasible, engage in efforts to increase the awareness of United States Government agencies and other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, of the immediate and long-term value of tropical forests.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(12) To the fullest extent feasible, utilize the resources and abilities of all relevant United States Government agencies.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(13) Require that any program or project under this part significantly affecting tropical forests (including projects involving the planting of exotic plant species)&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) be based upon careful analysis of the alternatives available to achieve the best sustainable use of the land, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) take full account of the environmental impacts of the proposed activities on biological diversity,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">as provided for in the environmental procedures of the Agency for International Development.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(14) Deny assistance under this part for&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) the procurement or use of logging equipment, unless an environmental assessment indicates that all timber harvesting operations involved will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which minimizes forest destruction and that the proposed activity will produce positive economic benefits and sustainable forest management systems; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) actions which significantly degrade national parks or similar protected areas which contain tropical forests or introduce exotic plants or animals into such areas.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(15) Deny assistance under this part for the following activities unless an environmental assessment indicates that the proposed activity will contribute significantly and directly to improving the livelihood of the rural poor and will be conducted in an environmentally sound manner which supports sustainable development:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Activities which would result in the conversion of forest lands to the rearing of livestock.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The construction, upgrading, or maintenance of roads (including temporary haul roads for logging or other extractive industries) which pass through relatively undegraded forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The colonization of forest lands.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The construction of dams or other water control structures which flood relatively undegraded forest lands.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever feasible, the President shall accomplish the objectives of this section through projects managed by private and voluntary organizations or international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations which are active in the region or country where the project is located.</p>

<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings and purposes</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds the survival of many animal and plant species is endangered by over-hunting, by the presence of toxic chemicals in water, air and soil, and by the destruction of habitats. The Congress further finds that the extinction of animal and plant species is an irreparable loss with potentially serious environmental and economic consequences for developing and developed countries alike. Accordingly, the preservation of animal and plant species through the regulation of the hunting and trade in endangered species, through limitations on the pollution of natural ecosystems, and through the protection of wildlife habitats should be an important objective of the United States development assistance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Remedial measures</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to preserve biological diversity, the President is authorized to furnish assistance <!-- PDFPage:468 -->under subchapter I of this chapter, notwithstanding section 2420 of this title, to assist countries in protecting and maintaining wildlife habitats and in developing sound wildlife management and plant conservation programs. Special efforts should be made to establish and maintain wildlife sanctuaries, reserves, and parks; to enact and enforce anti-poaching measures; and to identify, study, and catalog animal and plant species, especially in tropical environments.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Funding level</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For fiscal year 1987, not less than $2,500,000 of the funds available to carry out subchapter I of this chapter (excluding funds made available to carry out section 2151b(c)(2) of this title, relating to the Child Survival Fund) shall be allocated for assistance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for activities which were not funded prior to fiscal year 1987. In addition, the Agency for International Development shall, to the fullest extent possible, continue and increase assistance pursuant to subsection (b) of this section for activities for which assistance was provided in fiscal years prior to fiscal year 1987.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Country analysis requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Each country development strategy statement or other country plan prepared by the Agency for International Development shall include an analysis of&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the actions necessary in that country to conserve biological diversity, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the extent to which the actions proposed for support by the Agency meet the needs thus identified.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Local involvement</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">To the fullest extent possible, projects supported under this section shall include close consultation with and involvement of local people at all stages of design and implementation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) PVOs and other nongovernmental organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whenever feasible, the objectives of this section shall be accomplished through projects managed by appropriate private and voluntary organizations, or international, regional, or national nongovernmental organizations, which are active in the region or country where the project is located.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Actions by AID</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Administrator of the Agency for International Development shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) cooperate with appropriate international organizations, both governmental and nongovernmental;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) look to the World Conservation Strategy as an overall guide for actions to conserve biological diversity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) engage in dialogues and exchanges of information with recipient countries which stress the importance of conserving biological diversity for the long-term economic benefit of those countries and which identify and focus on policies of those countries which directly or indirectly contribute to loss of biological diversity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) support training and education efforts which improve the capacity of recipient countries to prevent loss of biological diversity;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) whenever possible, enter into long-term agreements in which the recipient country agrees to protect ecosystems or other wildlife habitats recommended for protection by relevant governmental or nongovernmental organizations or as a result of activities undertaken pursuant to paragraph (6), and the United States agrees to provide, subject to obtaining the necessary appropriations, additional assistance necessary for the establishment and maintenance of such protected areas;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) support, as necessary and in cooperation with the appropriate governmental and nongovernmental organizations, efforts to identify and survey ecosystems in recipient countries worthy of protection;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) cooperate with and support the relevant efforts of other agencies of the United States Government, including the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Park Service, the Forest Service, and the Peace Corps;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(8) review the Agency's environmental regulations and revise them as necessary to ensure that ongoing and proposed actions by the Agency do not inadvertently endanger wildlife species or their critical habitats, harm protected areas, or have other adverse impacts on biological diversity (and shall report to the Congress within a year after October 24, 1986, on the actions taken pursuant to this paragraph);</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151u. Private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives in overseas development</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional finding of importance of participation by private and voluntary organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that the participation of rural and urban poor people in their countries&rsquo; <!-- PDFPage:471 -->development can be assisted and accelerated in an effective manner through an increase in activities planned and carried out by private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives. Such organizations and cooperatives, embodying the American spirit of self-help and assistance to others to improve their lives and incomes, constitute an important means of mobilizing private American financial and human resources to benefit poor people in developing countries. The Congress declares that it is in the interest of the United States that such organizations and cooperatives expand their overseas development efforts without compromising their private and independent nature. The Congress further declares that the financial resources of such organizations and cooperatives should be supplemented by the contribution of public funds for the purpose of undertaking development activities in accordance with the principles set forth in section 2151&ndash;1 of this title and, if necessary and determined on a case-by-case basis, for the purpose of sharing the cost of developing programs related to such activities. The Congress urges the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, in implementing programs authorized under subchapter I of this chapter, to draw on the resource of private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives to plan and carry out development activities and to establish simplified procedures for the development and approval of programs to be carried out by such private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives as have demonstrated a capacity to undertake effective development activities.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Payment of transportation charges on shipments by American National Red Cross and United States voluntary agencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In order to further the efficient use of United States voluntary contributions for development, relief, and rehabilitation of friendly peoples, the President is authorized to use funds made available for the purposes of this part and part X of this subchapter to pay transportation charges on shipments by the American National Red Cross and by United States voluntary agencies registered with the Agency for International Development.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Reimbursement for transportation charges</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Reimbursement under this section may be provided for transportation charges on shipments from United States ports, or in the case of excess or surplus property supplied by the United States from foreign ports, to ports of entry abroad or to points of entry abroad in cases (1) of landlocked countries, (2) where ports cannot be used effectively because of natural or other disturbances, (3) where carriers to a specified country are unavailable, or (4) where a substantial savings in costs or time can be effected by the utilization of points of entry other than ports.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Arrangements with receiving country for free entry of shipments and for availability of local currency to defray transportation costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Where practicable, the President shall make arrangements with the receiving country for free entry of such shipments and for the making available by the country of local currencies for the purpose of defraying the transportation costs of such shipments from the port or point of entry of the receiving country to the designated shipping point of the consignee.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Continuation of support for programs in countries antedating prohibitions on assistance; national interest considerations; report to Congress</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Prohibitions on assistance to countries contained in this chapter or any other Act shall not be construed to prohibit assistance by the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter in support of programs of private and voluntary organizations and cooperatives already being supported prior to the date such prohibition becomes applicable. The President shall take into consideration, in any case in which statutory prohibitions on assistance would be applicable but for this subsection, whether continuation of support for such programs is in the national interest of the United States. If the President continues such support after such date, he shall prepare and transmit, not later than one year after such date, to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate a report setting forth the reasons for such continuation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Funds for private and voluntary organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For each of the fiscal years 1986 through 1989, funds in an amount not less than thirteen and one half percent of the aggregate amount appropriated for that fiscal year to carry out sections 2151a(a), 2151b(b), 2151b(c), 2151c, 2151d, 2151s,<sup><a href="#2151u_1_target" name="2151u_1">1</a></sup> and 2292 of this title shall be made available for the activities of private and voluntary organizations, and the President shall seek to channel funds in an amount not less than 16 percent of such aggregate amount for the activities of private and voluntary organizations. Funds made available under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter for the activities of private and voluntary organizations may be considered in determining compliance with the requirements of this subsection.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Promotion of democratic cooperatives</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that, in addition to their role in social and economic development, cooperatives provide an opportunity for people to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking. Therefore, assistance under this part shall be provided to rural and urban cooperatives which offer large numbers of low- and middle-income people in developing countries an opportunity to participate directly in democratic decisionmaking.

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2151v. Aid to relatively least developed countries</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Characterization of least developed countries</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Relatively least developed countries (as determined on the basis of criteria comparable to those used for the United Nations General Assembly list of &ldquo;least developed countries&rdquo;) are characterized by extreme poverty, very limited infrastructure, and limited administrative capacity to implement basic human needs growth strategies. In such countries special measures may be necessary to insure the full effectiveness of assistance furnished under subchapter I of this chapter.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Assistance on grant basis</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">For the purpose of promoting economic growth in these countries, the President is authorized and encouraged to make assistance under this part available on a grant basis to the maximum extent that is consistent with the attainment of United States development objectives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Waiver of principal and interest on prior liability</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The Congress recognizes that the relatively least developed countries have virtually no access to private international capital markets. Insofar as possible, prior assistance terms should be consistent with present grant assistance terms for relatively least developed countries. Therefore, notwithstanding section 2370(r) of this title and section 321 of the International Development and Food Assistance Act of 1975 but subject to paragraph (2) of this subsection, the President on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the needs of the country for financial resources and the commitment of the country to the development objectives set forth in sections 2151 and 2151&ndash;1 of this title&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) may permit a relatively least developed country to place amounts, which would otherwise be paid to the United States as payments on principal or interest on liability incurred by that country under subchapter I of this chapter (or any predecessor legislation) into local currency accounts (in equivalent amounts of local currencies as determined by the official exchange rate for United States dollars) for use by the relatively least developed country, with the concurrence of the Administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, for activities which are consistent with section 2151&ndash;1 of this title; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) may waive interest payments on liability incurred by a relatively least developed country under subchapter I of this chapter (or any predecessor legislation) if the President determines that that country would be unable to use for development purposes the equivalent amounts of local currencies which could be made available under subparagraph (A).</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The aggregate amount of interest waived and interest and principal paid into local currency accounts under this subsection in any fiscal year may not exceed the amount approved for such purpose in an Act appropriating funds to carry out this part for that fiscal year, which amount may not exceed the amount authorized to be so approved by the annual authorizing legislation for development assistance programs. Amounts due and payable during fiscal year 1981 to the United States from relatively least developed countries on loans made under this subchapter (or any predecessor legislation) are authorized to be approved for use, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph (1) of this subsection, in an amount not to exceed $10,845,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) In exercising the authority granted by this subsection, the President should act in concert with other creditor countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Waiver of requirement of contribution</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President may on a case-by-case basis waive the requirement of section 2151h(a) of this title for financial or &ldquo;in kind&rdquo; contributions in the case of programs, projects, or activities in relatively least developed countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Waiver of time limitations on aid</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 2151h(b) of this title shall not apply with respect to grants to relatively least developed countries.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that illicit narcotics cultivation is related to overall development problems and that the vast majority of all individuals employed in the cultivation of illicit narcotics reside in the developing countries and are among the poorest of the poor in those countries and that therefore the ultimate success of any effort to eliminate illicit narcotics production depends upon the availability of alternative economic opportunities for those individuals, upon other factors which assistance under this part could address, as well as upon direct narcotics control efforts.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Program planning priorities; resource utilization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) In planning programs of assistance under this part, and part X of this subchapter, and under part IV of subchapter II of this chapter for countries in which there is illicit narcotics cultivation, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter should give priority consideration to programs which would help reduce illicit narcotics cultivation by stimulating broader development opportunities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter may utilize resources for activities aimed at increasing awareness of the effects of production and trafficking of illicit narcotics on source and transit countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Administrative requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In furtherance of the purposes of this section, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall cooperate fully with, and share its expertise in development matters with, other agencies of the United States Government involved in narcotics control activities abroad.</p>

<h4 class="note-head">Torture Victims Relief; Effective Date</h4>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 105&ndash;320, Oct. 30, 1998, 112 Stat. 3016, provided that:</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;This Act may be cited as the &lsquo;Torture Victims Relief Act of 1998&rsquo;.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 2. FINDINGS.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;Congress makes the following findings:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The American people abhor torture by any government or person. The existence of torture creates a climate of fear and international insecurity that affects all people.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Torture is the deliberate mental and physical damage caused by governments to individuals to destroy individual personality and terrorize society. The effects of torture are long term. Those effects can last a lifetime for the survivors and affect future generations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) By eliminating the leadership of their opposition and frightening the general public, repressive governments often use torture as a weapon against democracy.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Torture survivors remain under physical and psychological threats, especially in communities where the perpetrators are not brought to justice. In many nations, even those who treat torture survivors are threatened with reprisals, including torture, for carrying out their ethical duty to provide care. Both the survivors of torture and their treatment providers should be accorded protection from further repression.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) A significant number of refugees and asylees entering the United States have been victims of torture. Those claiming asylum deserve prompt consideration of their applications for political asylum to minimize their insecurity and sense of danger. Many torture survivors now live in the United States. They should be provided with the rehabilitation services which would enable them to become productive members of our communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The development of a treatment movement for torture survivors has created new opportunities for action by the United States and other nations to oppose state-sponsored and other acts of torture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) There is a need for a comprehensive strategy to protect and support torture victims and their treatment providers, together with overall efforts to eliminate torture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) By acting to heal the survivors of torture and protect their families, the United States can help to heal the effects of torture and prevent its use around the world.</p>
<h4 class="note-sub-head">&ldquo;SEC. 3. DEFINITION.</h4>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;As used in this Act, the term &lsquo;torture&rsquo; has the meaning given the term in section 2340(1) of title 18, United States Code, and includes the use of rape and other forms of sexual violence by a person acting under the color of law upon another person under his custody or physical control.</p>

<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(2) Congress finds that progress toward independence for the Portuguese African territories will have a significant impact on the international organizations and the community of nations.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(3) Congress commends the Portuguese Government's initiatives on these fronts as evidence of a reaffirmation of that Government's support for her obligations under both the United Nations Charter and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.</p>

In addition, the United States Government should take the initiative among other donors, both bilateral and multilateral, in seeking significant contribution of development assistance for the three territories.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In light of the need of Angola, Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau for skilled and educated manpower, a priority consideration should be given to expanding current United States programs of educational assistance to the territories as a timely and substantive contribution to their independence.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Multilateral programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that the planning and administration of development assistance by, or under the sponsorship of the United Nations, multilateral lending institutions, and other multilateral organizations may contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of that assistance through participation of other donors in the development effort, improved coordination of policies and programs, pooling of knowledge, avoidance of duplication of facilities and manpower, and greater encouragement of self-help performance.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Regional programs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is further the sense of the Congress (1) that where problems or opportunities are common to two or more countries in a region, in such fields as agriculture, education, transportation, communications, power, watershed development, disease control, and establishment of development banks, these countries often can more effectively resolve such problems and exploit such opportunities by joining together in regional organizations or working together on regional programs, (2) that assistance often can be utilized more efficiently in regional programs than in separate country programs, and (3) that to the maximum extent practicable consistent with the purposes of this chapter assistance under this chapter should be furnished so as to encourage less developed countries to cooperate with each other in regional development programs.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Federal funds to multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations for loans to foreign countries; increase</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that the President should increase, to the extent practicable, the funds provided by the United States to multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations in which the United States participates for use by such institutions and organizations in making loans to foreign countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Transfer of funds; use of international or multilateral lending organizations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In furtherance of the provisions of subsection (a) of this section, any funds appropriated under subchapter I of this chapter may be transferred by the President to the International Development Association, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International Finance Corporation, the Asian Development Bank or other multilateral lending institutions and multilateral organizations in which the United States participates for the purpose of providing funds to enable any such institution or organization to make loans to foreign countries.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 93&ndash;559, &sect;55(a), Dec. 30, 1974, 88 Stat. 1819, provided that: &ldquo;The United Nations has designated thirty-two countries as &lsquo;Most Seriously Affected&rsquo; by the current economic crisis. These are countries without the internal food production capability or the foreign exchange availability to secure food to meet their immediate food requirements. The Congress calls upon the President and Secretary of State to take the following actions designed to mobilize appropriate resources to meet the food emergency:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) Review and make appropriate adjustments in the level of programming of our food and fertilizer assistance programs with the aim of increasing to the maximum extent feasible the volume of food and fertilizer available to those countries most seriously affected by current food shortages.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) Call upon all traditional and potential new donors of food, fertilizer, or the means of financing these commodities to immediately increase their participation in efforts to address the emergency food needs of the developing world.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Make available to these most seriously affected countries the maximum feasible volume of food commodities, with appropriate regard to the current domestic price and supply situations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) Maintain regular and full consultation with the appropriate committees of the Congress and report to the Congress and the Nation on steps which are being taken to help meet this food emergency. In accordance with this provision, the President shall report to the Congress on a global assessment of food needs for fiscal year 1975, specifying expected food grain deficits and currently planned programming of food assistance, and steps which are being taken to encourage other countries to increase their participation in food assistance or the financing of food assistance. Such report should reach the Congress promptly and should be supplemented quarterly for the remainder of fiscal year 1975.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) The Congress directs that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1975, not more than 30 percent of concessional food aid should be allocated to countries other than those which are most seriously affected by current food shortages, unless the President demonstrates to the appropriate Committees of the Congress that the use of such food assistance is solely for humanitarian food purposes.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) The Congress calls upon the President to proceed with the implementation of resolutions and recommendations adopted by the World Food Conference. The Congress believes that it is incumbent upon the United States to take a leading role in assisting in the development of a viable and coherent world food policy which would begin the task of alleviating widespread hunger and suffering prevalent in famine-stricken nations. The President shall report to the Congress within 120 days of enactment of this Act [Dec. 30, 1974] on the implementation of the resolutions and the extent to which the United States is participating in the implementation of resolutions adopted at the World Food Conference.&rdquo;</p>

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress recognizes that shelter, including essential urban development services, is among the most fundamental of human needs. Shelter for most people in the developing countries consists largely of domestic materials assembled by local labor. While recognizing that most financing for such shelter must come from domestic resources, the Congress finds that carefully designed programs involving United States capital and expertise can increase the availability of domestic financing for improved shelter and related services for low-income people by demonstrating to local entrepreneurs and institutions that providing low-cost shelter can be financially viable. The Congress reaffirms, therefore, that the United States should continue to assist developing countries in marshalling resources for low-cost shelter. Particular attention should be given to programs which will support pilot projects for low-cost shelter or which will have a maximum demonstration impact on local institutions and national policy. The Congress declares that the long run goal of all such programs should be to develop domestic construction capabilities and to stimulate local credit institutions to make available domestic capital and other management and technological resources required for effective low-cost shelter programs and policies.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Fees; determination by President; reduction</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">A fee shall be charged for each guaranty issued under section 2182 or 2182a of this title in an amount to be determined by the President.

Fees collected in connection with guaranties issued under section 2182a of this title shall likewise be available to meet similar expenses, costs, or liabilities incurred in connection with the programs authorized by that section. All of the foregoing fees referred to in this section together with earnings thereon and other income arising from guaranty operations under this subpart shall be held in a revolving fund account maintained in the Treasury of the United States. All funds in such account may be invested in obligations of the United States. Any interest or other receipts derived from such investments shall be credited to such account and may be used for the purposes cited in this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Priorities of funds for guaranty payments</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any payments made to discharge liabilities under guaranties issued under section 2182 of <!-- PDFPage:490 -->this title or heretofore under this subpart or under prior Latin American or other housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, shall be paid first out of fees referred to in subsection (b) of this section (excluding amounts required for purposes other than the discharge of liabilities under guaranties) as long as such fees are available, and thereafter shall be paid out of funds, if any, realized from the sale of currencies or other assets acquired in connection with any payment made to discharge liabilities under such guaranties as long as funds are available, and finally out of funds hereafter made available pursuant to subsection (e) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Guaranties as obligations backed by full faith and credit of United States</h4>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(i) the Administrator may exercise the authority to borrow under this paragraph only to such extent or in such amounts as are provided in advance in appropriation Acts; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(ii) the amount borrowed under this paragraph which is outstanding at any one time may not exceed $100,000,000.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(B) Any such borrowing shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into account the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities. The Secretary of the Treasury shall make loans under this paragraph and for such purpose may borrow on the credit of the United States in accordance with subchapter I of chapter 31 of title 31.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Agency determination of maximum rate of interest</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">In the case of any loan investment guaranteed under section 2182 of this title, the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter shall prescribe the maximum rate of interest allowable to the eligible investor, which maximum rate shall not exceed by more than 1 per centum the then current rate of interest applicable to housing mortgages insured by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. The maximum allowable rate of interest under this subsection shall be prescribed by the agency as of the date the project covered by the investment is officially authorized and, prior to the execution of the contract, the agency may amend such rate at its discretion, consistent with the provisions of this subsection.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Guaranties under prior acts</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Housing guaranties committed, authorized, or outstanding heretofore under this subpart or under prior housing guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969 shall continue subject to provisions of law originally applicable thereto and fees collected hereafter with respect to such guaranties shall be available for the purposes specified in subsection (b) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Fraud or misrepresentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment may be made under any guaranty issued pursuant to this subpart for any loss arising out of fraud or misrepresentation for which the party seeking payment is responsible.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">Guaranties shall be issued under section 2182 of this title only for housing projects which are coordinated with and complementary to any development assistance being furnished under part I of this subchapter and which are specifically designed to demonstrate the feasibility and suitability of particular kinds of housing or of financial or other institutional arrangements. Of the aggregate face value of housing guaranties hereafter issued under this subpart, not less than 90 per centum shall be issued for housing suitable for families with income below the median income (below the median urban income for housing in urban areas) in the country in which the housing is located.</p>

<h3 class="section-head">&sect;2186. Loan guarantees to Israel program</h3>
<!-- field-end:head -->
<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) In general</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to the terms and conditions of this section, during the period beginning October 1, 1992, and ending September 30, 1997, the President is authorized to issue guarantees against losses incurred in connection with loans to Israel made as a result of Israel's extraordinary humanitarian effort to resettle and absorb immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union, Ethiopia and other countries. In the event that less than the full amount authorized to be issued under subsection (b) of this section is issued in such period, the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall be available in the fiscal year ending on September 30, 1998.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Fiscal year levels</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President is authorized to issue guarantees in furtherance of the purposes of this section. Subject to subsection (d) of this section, the total principal amount of guarantees which may be issued by the President under this section shall be up to $10,000,000,000 which may be issued as follows:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) in fiscal year 1993, up to $2,000,000,000 may be issued on October 1, 1992 or thereafter;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) subject to subsection (d) of this section, in fiscal years 1994 through 1997, up to $2,000,000,000 in each fiscal year may be issued on October 1 or thereafter.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) If less than the full amount of guarantees authorized to be made available in a fiscal year pursuant to paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection is issued to Israel during that fiscal year, the authority to issue the balance of such guarantees shall extend to any subsequent fiscal year ending on or before September 30, 1998.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4)(A) Not later than September 1 of each year during the period in which the President is authorized to issue loan guarantees under subsection (a) of this section, beginning in fiscal year 1993, the President shall notify the appropriate congressional committees in writing of his intentions regarding the exercise of that authority for the fiscal year beginning on October 1 of that year, including a statement of the total principal amount of guarantees, if any, that the President proposes to issue for that fiscal year.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) For purposes of this paragraph, the term &ldquo;appropriate congressional committees&rdquo; means the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate and the Committee on Appropriations and the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Use of guarantees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Guarantees may be issued under this section only to support activities in the geographic areas which were subject to the administration of the Government of Israel before June 5, 1967.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Limitation on guarantee amount</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The amount of authorized but unissued guarantees that the President is authorized to issue as specified in subsection (b) of this section shall be reduced by an amount equal to the amount extended or estimated to have been extended by the Government of Israel during the previous year for activities which the President determines are inconsistent with the objectives of this section or understandings reached between the United States Government and the Govern<!-- PDFPage:495 -->ment of Israel regarding the implementation of the loan program. The President shall submit a report to Congress no later than September 30 of each fiscal year during the pendency of the program specifying the amount calculated under this subsection and that will be deducted from the amount of guarantees authorized to be issued in the next fiscal year.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Fees</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Fees charged for the loan guarantee program under this section each year shall be an aggregate annual origination fee equal to the estimated subsidy cost of the guarantees issued under this section for that year, calculated by the Office of Management and Budget for the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.]. This shall also include an amount for the administrative expenses of the Agency for International Development in administering the program under this section. All such fees shall be paid by the Government of Israel to the Government of the United States. Funds made available for Israel under part 4 of subchapter II of this chapter, may be utilized by the Government of Israel to pay such fees to the United States Government. No further appropriations of subsidy cost are needed for the loan guarantee authorized hereunder for fiscal year 1993 and the four succeeding fiscal years.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The origination fee shall be payable to the United States Government on a pro rata basis as each guarantee for each loan or increment is issued.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authority to suspend</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Except as provided in subsections (<em>l</em>) and (m) of this section, the President shall determine the terms and conditions for issuing guarantees. If the President determines that these terms and conditions have been breached, the President may suspend or terminate the provision of all or part of the additional loan guarantees not yet issued under this section. Upon making such a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Procedures for suspension or termination</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any suspension or termination pursuant to subsection (f) of this section shall be in accordance with the following procedures:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) Upon making a determination to suspend or terminate the provision of loan guarantees, the President shall submit to the Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President Pro Tempore of the Senate his determination to do so, including the basis for such suspension or termination.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) Such a suspension or termination shall cease to be effective if Congress enacts, within 30 days of submission, a joint resolution authorizing the assistance notwithstanding the suspension.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) Any such joint resolution shall be considered in the Senate in accordance with the provisions of section 601(b) of the International Security Assistance and Arms Export Control Act of 1976.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) For the purpose of expediting the consideration and enactment of joint resolutions under this subsection, a motion to proceed to the consideration of any such joint resolution after it has been reported by the appropriate committee shall be treated as highly privileged in the House of Representatives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) In the event that the President suspends the provision of additional loan guarantees under subsection (f) of this section and Congress does not enact a joint resolution pursuant to this subsection, the provision of additional loan guarantees under the program established by this section may be resumed only if the President determines and so reports to Congress that the reasons for the suspension have been resolved or that the resumption is otherwise in the national interest.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(h) Economic context</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The effective absorption of immigrants into Israel from the republics of the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia within the private sector requires large investment and economic restructuring to promote market efficiency and thereby contribute to productive employment and sustainable growth. Congress recognizes that the Government of Israel is developing an economic strategy designed to achieve these goals, and that the Government of Israel intends to adopt a comprehensive, multi-year economic strategy based on prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Congress also recognizes that these policies are being designed to reduce direct involvement of the government in the economic system and to promote private enterprise, important prerequisites for economic stability and sustainable growth.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(i) Consultations</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that, as agreed between the two Governments and in order to further the policies specified in subsection (h) of this section, Israel and the United States should continue to engage in consultations concerning economic and financial measures, including structural and other reforms, that Israel should undertake during the pendency of this program to enable its economy to absorb and resettle immigrants and to accommodate the increased debt burden that will result from loans guaranteed pursuant to this section. It is the sense of the Congress that these consultations on economic measures should address progress and plans in the areas of budget policies, privatization, trade liberalization, financial and capital markets, labor markets, competition policy, and deregulation.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(j) Goods and services</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">During the pendency of the loan program authorized under this section, it is anticipated that, in the context of the economic reforms undertaken pursuant to subsections (h) and (i) of this section, Israel's increased population due to its absorption of immigrants, and the liberalization by the Government of Israel of its trade policy with the United States, the amount of United States investment goods and services purchased for use in or with respect to the country of Israel will substantially increase.</p>
<!-- PDFPage:496 --><h4 class="subsection-head">(k) Reports</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The President shall report to Congress by December 31 of each fiscal year until December 31, 1999, regarding the implementation of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>l</em>) Applicability of certain sections</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Section 2183 of this title shall apply to guarantees issued under subsection (a) of this section in the same manner as such section applies to guarantees issued under section 2182 of this title, except that subsections (a), (e)(1), (g), and (j) of section 2183 of this title shall not apply to such guarantees and except that, to the extent section 2183 of this title is inconsistent with the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], that Act shall apply. Loans shall be guaranteed under this section without regard to sections 2181, 2182, and 2198(c) of this title. Notwithstanding section 2183(f) of this title, the interest rate for loans guaranteed under this section may include a reasonable fee to cover the costs and fees incurred by the borrower in connection with this program or financing under this section in the event the borrower elects not to finance such costs or fees out of loan principal. Guarantees once issued hereunder shall be unconditional and fully and freely transferable.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(m) Terms and conditions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) Each loan guarantee issued under this section shall guarantee 100 percent of the principal and interest payable on such loans.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The standard terms of any loan or increment guaranteed under this section shall be 30 years with semiannual payments of interest only over the first 10 years, and with semiannual payments of principal and interest on a level payment basis, over the last 20 years thereof, except that the guaranteed loan or any increments issued in a single transaction may include obligations having different maturities, interest rates, and payment terms if the aggregate scheduled debt service for all obligations issued in a single transaction equals the debt service for a single loan or increment of like amount having the standard terms described in this sentence. The guarantor shall not have the right to accelerate any guaranteed loan or increment or to pay any amounts in respect of the guarantees issued other than in accordance with the original payment terms of the loan. For purposes of determining the maximum principal amount of any loan or increment to be guaranteed under this section, the principal amount of each such loan or increment shall be&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) in the case of any loan issued on a discount basis, the original issue price (excluding any transaction costs) thereof; or</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) in the case of any loan issue&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2186_1_target" name="2186_1">1</a></sup> on an interest-bearing basis, the stated principal amount thereof.</p>

<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Recognizing that major private investments in less developed friendly countries or areas are often made by enterprises in which there is multinational participation, including significant United States private participation, the Corporation may make arrangements with foreign governments (including agencies, instrumentalities, or political subdivisions thereof) or with multilateral organizations and institutions for sharing liabilities assumed under investment insurance for such investments and may in connection therewith issue insurance to investors not otherwise eligible hereunder, except that liabilities assumed by the Corporation under the authority of this subsection shall be consistent with the purposes of this subpart and that the maximum share of liabilities so assumed shall not exceed the proportionate participation by eligible investors in the project.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) The maximum contingent liability outstanding at any one time pursuant to insurance issued under section 2194(a) of this title, and the amount of financing issued under sections&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2195_1_target" name="2195_1">1</a></sup> 2194(b) and (c) of this title, shall not exceed in the aggregate $29,000,000,000.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) Subject to spending authority provided in appropriations Acts pursuant to section 661c(b) of title 2, the Corporation is authorized to transfer such sums as are necessary from its noncredit activities to pay for the subsidy cost of the investment guaranties and direct loan programs under subsections (b) and (c) of section 2194 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Termination of authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">The authority of subsections (a), (b), and (c) of section 2194 of this title shall continue until September 30, 1999.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Repealed. Pub. L. 102&ndash;549, title I, &sect;104(a)(3), Oct. 28, 1992, 106 Stat. 3652</h4>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Insurance Reserve; Guaranty Reserve</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There shall be established in the Treasury of the United States an insurance and guaranty fund, which shall have separate accounts to be known as the Insurance Reserve and the Guaranty Reserve, which reserves shall be available for discharge of liabilities, as provided in subsection (d) of this section, until such time as all such liabilities have been discharged or have expired or until all such reserves have been expended in accordance with the provisions of this section. Such fund shall be funded by: (1) the funds heretofore available to discharge liabilities under predecessor guaranty authority (including housing guaranty authorities), less both the amount made available for housing guaranty programs pursuant to section 2183(b) of this title and the amount made available to the Corporation pursuant to subsection (e) of this section; and (2) such sums as shall be appropriated pursuant to subsection (f) of this section for such purpose. The allocation of such funds to each such reserve shall be determined by the Board after consultation with the Secretary of the Treasury. Additional amounts may thereafter be transferred to such reserves pursuant to section 2196 of this title.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Priority of funds used to discharge liabilities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Any payments made to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance issued under section 2194 of this title, under similar predecessor guaranty authority, or under section 2194b of this title shall be paid first out of the Insurance Reserve, as long as such reserve remains available, and thereafter out of funds made available pursuant to subsection (f) of this section. Any payments made to discharge liabilities under guaranties issued under section 2194(b) of this title or under similar predecessor guaranty authority shall be paid first out of the Guaranty Reserve as long as such reserve remains available, and thereafter out of funds made available pursuant to subsection (f) of this section.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(e) Reserves from predecessor guaranty authority</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There is hereby authorized to be transferred to the Corporation at its call, for the purposes specified in section 2196 of this title, all fees and other revenues collected under predecessor guaranty authority from December 31, 1968, available as of the date of such transfer.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(f) Authorization of appropriations; issuance, etc., of obligations by Corporation for purchase by Secretary of the Treasury</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">There are authorized to be appropriated to the Corporation, to remain available until expended, such amounts as may be necessary from time to time to replenish or increase the insurance and guaranty fund, to discharge the liabilities under insurance, reinsurance, or guaranties issued by the Corporation or issued under predecessor guaranty authority, or to discharge obligations of the Corporation purchased by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to this subsection. However, no appropriations shall be made to augment the Insurance Reserve until the amount of funds in the Insurance Reserve is less than $25,000,000. Any appropriations to augment the Insurance Reserve shall then only be made either pursuant to specific authorization enacted after August 27, 1974, or to satisfy the full faith and credit provision of section 2197(c) of this title. In order to discharge liabilities under investment insurance or reinsurance, the Cor<!-- PDFPage:506 -->poration is authorized to issue from time to time for purchase by the Secretary of the Treasury its notes, debentures, bonds, or other obligations; but the aggregate amount of such obligations outstanding at any one time shall not exceed $100,000,000. Any such obligation shall be repaid to the Treasury within one year after the date of issue of such obligation. Any such obligation shall bear interest at a rate determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, taking into consideration the current average market yield on outstanding marketable obligations of the United States of comparable maturities during the month preceding the issuance of any obligation authorized by this subsection. The Secretary of the Treasury shall purchase any obligation of the Corporation issued under this subsection, and for such purchase he may use as a public debt transaction the proceeds of the sale of any securities issued under chapter 31 of title 31 after August 27, 1974. The purpose for which securities may be issued under such chapter shall include any such purchase.</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Guaranties as obligations backed by full faith and credit of United States</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">All guaranties issued prior to July 1, 1956, all guaranties issued under sections 1872(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2197_1_target" name="2197_1">1</a></sup> and 1933(b)&nbsp;<sup><a href="#2197_1_target" name="2197_1">1</a></sup> of this title, all guaranties heretofore issued pursuant to prior guaranty authorities repealed by the Foreign Assistance Act of 1969, and all insurance, reinsurance and guaranties issued pursuant to this subpart shall constitute obligations, in accordance with the terms of such insurance, reinsurance or guaranties, of the United States of America and the full faith and credit of the United States of America is hereby <!-- PDFPage:508 -->pledged for the full payment and performance of such obligations.</p>

<h4 class="paragraph-head">(2) Credit transaction costs</h4>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">Project-specific transaction costs incurred by the Corporation relating to loan obligations or loan guarantee commitments covered by the provisions of the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 [2 U.S.C. 661 et seq.], including the costs of project-related travel and expenses for legal representation provided by persons outside the Corporation and other similar expenses which are charged to the borrower, shall be paid out of the appropriate finance account established pursuant to section 505(b) of such Act [2 U.S.C. 661d(b)].</p>

Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall limit the amount of direct insurance and reinsurance issued by it under section 2194 or 2194b of this title so that risk of loss as to at least 10 per centum of the total investment of the insured and its affiliates in the project is borne by the insured and such affiliates, except that such limitation shall not apply to direct insurance or reinsurance of loans by banks or other financial institutions to unrelated parties.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(g) Fraud or misrepresentation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">No payment may be made under any guaranty, insurance, or reinsurance issued pursuant to this subpart for any loss arising out of fraud or misrepresentation for which the party seeking payment is responsible.</p>

<p class="statutory-body">(2) Not later than 120 days after April 24, 1978, the Corporation shall adopt regulations setting forth appropriate conditions under which any person convicted under the Foreign Corrupt <!-- PDFPage:509 -->Practices Act of 1977 for an offense related to a project insured or otherwise supported by the Corporation shall be suspended, for a period of not more than five years, from eligibility to receive any insurance, reinsurance, guaranty, loan, or other financial support authorized by this subpart.</p>

<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to the maximum extent practicable, any restriction under any law of the United States relating to public health or safety or the environment that would apply to the project if the project were undertaken in the United States.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block">The notification under the preceding sentence shall include a summary of the guidelines, standards, and restrictions referred to in subparagraphs (A) and (B), and may include any environmental impact statement, assessment, review, or study prepared with respect to the investment pursuant to section 2199(g) of this title.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(2) Before finally providing insurance, reinsurance, guarantees, or financing for any investment subject to paragraph (1), the Corporation shall take into account any comments it receives on the project involved.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">(3) On or before September 30, 1986, the Corporation shall notify appropriate government officials of a country of the guidelines, standards, and legal restrictions described in paragraph (1) that apply to any project in that country&mdash;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(n) Penalties for fraud</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Whoever knowingly makes any false statement or report, or willfully overvalues any land, property, or security, for the purpose of influencing in any way the action of the Corporation with respect to any insurance, reinsurance, guarantee, loan, equity investment, or other activity of the Corporation under section 2194 of this title or any change or extension of any such insurance, reinsurance, guarantee, loan, equity investment, or activity, by renewal, deferment of action or otherwise, or the acceptance, release, or substitution of security therefor, shall be fined not more than $1,000,000 or imprisoned not more than 30 years, or both.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(<em>o</em>) Use of local currencies</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Direct loans or investments made in order to preserve the value of funds received in inconvertible foreign currency by the Corporation as a result of activities conducted pursuant to section 2194(a) of this title shall not be considered in determining whether the Corporation has made or has outstanding loans or investments to the extent of any limitation on obligations and equity investment imposed by or pursuant to this subpart.

<!-- field-start:statute -->
<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional objectives and findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, the United States should strengthen the capacities of the United States land-grant and other eligible universities in program-related agricultural institutional development and research, consistent with sections 2151a and 2151a&ndash;1 of this title, should improve their participation in the United States Government's international efforts to apply more effective agricultural sciences to the goal of increasing world food production, and in general should provide increased and longer term support to the application of science to solving food and nutrition problems of the developing countries.</p>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress so declares because it finds&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) that the establishment, endowment, and continuing support of land-grant universities in the United States by Federal, State, and county governments has led to agricultural progress in this country;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) that land-grant and other universities in the United States have demonstrated over many years their ability to cooperate with foreign agricultural institutions in expanding indigenous food production for both domestic and international markets;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) that, in a world of growing population with rising expectations, increased food production and improved distribution, storage, and marketing in the developing countries is necessary not only to prevent hunger but to build the economic base for growth, and moreover, that the greatest potential for increasing world food supplies is in the developing countries where the gap between food need and food supply is the greatest and current yields are lowest;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) that increasing and making more secure the supply of food is of greatest benefit to the poorest majority in the developing world;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) that research, teaching, and extension activities, and appropriate institutional development therefor are prime factors in increasing agricultural production abroad (as well as in the United States) and in improving food distribution, storage, and marketing;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(6) moreover, that agricultural research abroad has in the past and will continue in the future to provide benefits for agriculture in the United States and that increasing the availability of food of higher nutritional quality is of benefit to all; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(7) that universities need a dependable source of Federal funding, as well as other financing, in order to expand, or in some cases to continue, their efforts to assist in increasing agricultural production in developing countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Congressional objectives and declaration for collation of components to increase world food production</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Accordingly, the Congress declares that, in order to prevent famine and establish freedom from hunger, various components must be brought together in order to increase world food production, including&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) strengthening the capabilities of universities to assist in increasing agricultural production in developing countries;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) institution-building programs for development of national and regional agricultural research and extension capacities in developing countries which need assistance;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) international agricultural research centers;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(4) contract research; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(5) research program grants.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) University involvement, participation, and cooperation</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The United States should&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) effectively involve the United States land-grant and other eligible universities more extensively in each component;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) provide mechanisms for the universities to participate and advise in the planning, development, implementation, and administration of each component; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(3) assist such universities in cooperative joint efforts with&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:519 --><p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) agricultural institutions in developing nations, and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) regional and international agricultural research centers,</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-block-1em">directed to strengthening their joint and respective capabilities and to engage them more effectively in research, teaching, and extension activities for solving problems in food production, distribution, storage, marketing, and consumption in agriculturally underdeveloped nations.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Universities</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">As used in this subpart, the term &ldquo;universities&rdquo; means those colleges or universities in each State, territory, or possession of the United States, or the District of Columbia, now receiving, or which may hereafter receive, benefits under the Act of July 2, 1862 (known as the First Morrill Act) [7 U.S.C. 301 et seq.], or the Act of August 30, 1890 (known as the Second Morrill Act) [7 U.S.C. 321 et seq.], which are commonly known as &ldquo;land-grant&rdquo; universities; institutions now designated or which may hereafter be designated as sea-grant colleges under the Act of October 15, 1966 (known as the National Sea Grant College and Program Act) [33 U.S.C. 1121 et seq.], which are commonly known as sea-grant colleges; and other United States colleges and universities which&mdash;</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 95&ndash;426, title VI, &sect;604, Oct. 7, 1978, 92 Stat. 986, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) half a billion people suffer regularly from malnutrition or undernutrition;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) even very modest shortfalls in crop production can result in greatly increased human suffering, and undercut the benefits of bilateral and multilateral assistance programs, in poor developing countries with chronic food deficits;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) increasing variability in world food production and trade presents a serious threat not only to consumers but also to producers;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) the World Food Conference recognized the urgent need for an international undertaking to achieve a system of world food security based largely upon strategic food reserves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) the Congress through legislation has repeatedly urged the President to negotiate with other nations to establish such a system of reserves;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) although the nations of the world have agreed to begin discussions on a system of grain reserves to regulate food availability, agreement on a global network of nationally held reserves still eludes the international community;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) while some progress has taken place in the United States in creating domestic farmer held reserves, the scale of such reserves does not insure adequate protection against fluctuations in world production and price; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8) the United States, as the world's leading producer of foodstuffs, remains in a unique position to provide the leadership necessary to make world food security a reality.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) It is therefore the sense of the Congress that the President should continue his efforts directed toward achievement of an agreement establishing an international network of nationally held grain reserves which provides for supply assurance to consumers and income security to producers.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="note-body">Similar provisions were contained in the following prior authorization act:</p>
<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 95&ndash;105, title V, &sect;510, Aug. 17, 1977, 91 Stat. 860.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 95&ndash;426, title VII, &sect;711, Oct. 7, 1978, 92 Stat. 994, which authorized funds to be appropriated for fiscal years 1979 and 1980 for a commission to conduct studies on global hunger and malnutrition, which commission was to make recommendations to the President and Congress on policies to increase the capacity of the United States to reduce hunger and malnutrition, was repealed by Pub. L. 97&ndash;241, title V, &sect;505(a)(2), Aug. 24, 1982, 96 Stat. 299.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 93&ndash;189, &sect;39, Dec. 17, 1973, 87 Stat. 735, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) It is the sense of the Congress that the United States should participate fully in efforts to alleviate current and future food shortages which threaten the world. To this end, the President shall&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) encourage, support, and expedite, studies relating to the long-range implications of the world food situation (including studies of national and world production, distribution, and utilization of agricultural commodities and other foodstuffs) and support the organizing of a world food conference under United Nations auspices in 1974;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:520 --><p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) request the member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to explore the means for assuring equitable access by all nations to national markets and mineral and agricultural resources;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) consult and cooperate with appropriate international agencies, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, in determining the need for, the feasibility of, and cost on an equitably-shared basis of, establishing an international system of strategic food reserves; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) report his findings and recommendations to the Congress on the implementation of this section no later than December 31, 1974.</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(b) It is further the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) in making assessments which would affect or relate to the level of domestic production, the Executive Branch should include in the estimates of overall utilization the expected demands for humanitarian food assistance through such programs as are carried out under the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480) [section 1691 et seq. of Title 7, Agriculture]; and</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) legislation providing increased flexibility for responding to emergency and humanitarian requirements for food assistance should be considered as promptly as possible to the end that the last sentence of section 401 of the Agricultural Trade Development and Assistance Act of 1954 (Public Law 480) [section 1731 of title 7], may be amended by striking the period and inserting in lieu thereof a comma and the following: &lsquo;unless the Secretary determines that some part of the exportable supply should be used to carry out the national interest and humanitarian objectives of this Act [see Short Title of 1973 Amendment note set out under section 2151 of this title]&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 class="subsection-head">(a) Congressional findings</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the building of democracy, the restoration of peace, the improvement of living conditions, and the application of equal justice under law in Central America are important to the interests of the United States and the community of American States; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the interrelated issues of social and human progress, economic growth, political reform, and regional security must be effectively dealt with to assure a democratic and economically and politically secure Central America.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Policy requirements</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The achievement of democracy, respect for human rights, peace, and equitable economic growth depends primarily on the cooperation and the human and economic resources of the people and governments of Central America. The Congress recognizes that the United States can make a significant contribution to such peaceful and democratic development through a consistent and coherent policy which includes a long-term commitment of assistance. This policy should be designed to support actively&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) democracy and political reform, including opening the political process to all members of society;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) full observance of internationally recognized human rights, including free elections, freedom of the press, freedom of association, and the elimination of all human rights abuses;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(C) leadership development, including training and educational programs to improve public administration and the administration of justice;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(D) land reform, reform in tax systems, encouragement of private enterprise and individual initiative, creation of favorable investment climates, curbing corruption where it exists, and spurring balanced trade;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(E) the establishment of the rule of law and an effective judicial system; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(F) the termination of extremist violence by both the left and the right as well as vigorous action to prosecute those guilty of crimes and the prosecution to the extent possible of past offenders.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body">(2) The policy described in paragraph (1) should also promote equitable economic growth and development, including controlling the flight of capital and the effective use of foreign assistance and adhering to approved programs for economic stabilization and fiscal responsibility. Finally, this policy should foster dialog and negotiations&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(A) to achieve peace based upon the objectives of democratization, reduction of armament, an end to subversion, and the with<!-- PDFPage:531 -->drawal of foreign military forces and advisers; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(B) to provide a security shield against violence and intimidation.</p>
<br class="Q04" />

<p class="statutory-body">The Congress finds that participation by Central American countries in an effective forum for dialog on, and the continuous review and advancement of, Central America's political, economic, and social development would foster cooperation between the United States and Central American countries.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(b) Sense of Congress; Central American Development Organization; establishment, etc.</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">It is the sense of the Congress that&mdash;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(1) the President should enter into negotiations with the countries of Central America to establish a Central American Development Organization (hereafter in this section referred to as the &ldquo;Organization&rdquo;) to help provide a continuous and coherent approach to the development of the Central American region; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-1em">(2) the establishment of the Organization should be based upon the following principles:</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(A) Participation in the Organization should be open to the United States, other donors, and those Central American countries that commit themselves to, among other things, respecting internationally recognized human rights, building democracy, and encouraging equitable economic growth through policy reforms.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(B) The Organization should be structured to include representatives from both the public and private sectors, including representatives from the labor, agriculture, and business communities.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(C) The Organization should meet periodically to carry out the functions described in subparagraphs (D) and (E) of this paragraph and should be supported by a limited professional secretariat.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(D) The Organization should make recommendations affecting Central American countries on such matters as&mdash;</p>
<!-- PDFPage:532 --><p class="statutory-body-3em">(i) political, economic, and social development objectives, including the strengthening of democratic pluralism and the safeguarding of internationally recognized human rights;</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(ii) mobilization of resources and external assistance needs; and</p>
<p class="statutory-body-3em">(iii) reform of economic policies and structures.</p>
<br class="Q04" />
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(E) The Organization should have the capacity for monitoring country performance on recommendations issued in accordance with subparagraph (D) of this paragraph and for evaluating progress toward meeting such country objectives.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(F) To the maximum extent practicable, the United States should follow the recommendations of the Organization in disbursing bilateral economic assistance for any Central American country. No more than 75 percent of such United States assistance in any fiscal year should be disbursed until the recommendations of the Organization for that fiscal year have been made final and communicated to the donor countries. The limitation on disbursements contained in the preceding sentence should apply only to recommendations made final and communicated to donor countries prior to the fourth quarter of such fiscal year. The United States representative to the Organization should urge other donor countries to similarly implement the recommendations of the Organization.</p>
<p class="statutory-body-2em">(G) The administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, or his designee, should represent the United States Government in the Organization and should carry out his functions in that capacity under the continuous supervision and general direction of the Secretary of State.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(c) Participation of President in Organization</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">Subject to subsection (d)(2) of this section, the President is authorized to participate in the Organization.</p>
<h4 class="subsection-head">(d) Preparation and transmission of proposal for implementation of provisions</h4>
<p class="statutory-body">(1) The administrator of the agency primarily responsible for administering subchapter I of this chapter, under the supervision and direction of the Secretary of State, shall prepare a detailed proposal to carry out this section and shall keep the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate fully and currently informed concerning the development of this proposal.</p>

<p class="note-body">Pub. L. 105&ndash;385, &sect;2, Nov. 13, 1998, 112 Stat. 3460, provided that:</p>
<p class="note-body">&ldquo;(a) <cap-smallcap>Findings</cap-smallcap>.&mdash;Congress finds the following:</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(1) The economic, security, and humanitarian interests of the United States and the nations of sub-Saharan Africa would be enhanced by sustainable, broad-based agricultural and rural development in each of the African nations.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(2) According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the number of undernourished people in Africa has more than doubled, from approximately 100,000,000 in the late 1960s to 215,000,000 in 1998, and is projected to increase to 265,000,000 by the year 2010. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization, the term &lsquo;under nutrition&rsquo; means inadequate consumption of nutrients, often adversely affecting children's physical and mental development, undermining their future as productive and creative members of their communities.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(3) Currently, agricultural production in Africa employs about two-thirds of the workforce but produces less than one-fourth of the gross domestic product in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the World Bank Group.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(4) African women produce up to 80 percent of the total food supply in Africa according to the International Food Policy Research Institute.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(5) An effective way to improve conditions of the poor is to increase the productivity of the agricultural sector. Productivity increases can be fostered by increasing research and education in agriculture and rural development.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(6) In November 1996, the World Food Summit set a goal of reducing hunger worldwide by 50 percent by the year 2015 and encouraged national governments to develop domestic food plans and to support international aid efforts.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(7) Although the World Bank Group recently has launched a major initiative to support agricultural and rural development, only 10 percent, or $1,200,000,000, of its total lending to sub-Saharan Africa for fiscal years 1993 to 1997 was devoted to agriculture.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(8)(A) United States food processing and agricultural sectors benefit greatly from the liberalization of global trade and increased exports.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Africa represents a growing market for United States food and agricultural products. Africa's food imports are projected to rise from less than 8,000,000 metric tons in 1990 to more than 25,000,000 metric tons by the [sic] 2020.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(9)(A) Increased private sector investment in African countries and expanded trade between the United States and Africa can greatly help African countries achieve food self-sufficiency and graduate from dependency on international assistance.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Development assistance, technical assistance, and training can facilitate and encourage commercial development in Africa, such as improving rural roads, agricultural research and extension, and providing access to credit and other resources.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(10)(A) Several United States private voluntary organizations have demonstrated success in empowering Africans through direct business ownership and helping African agricultural producers more efficiently and directly market their products.</p>
<p class="note-body-1em">&ldquo;(B) Rural business associations, owned and controlled by farmer shareholders, also greatly help agricultural producers to increase their household incomes.</p>
